Description: 
	Results of Front-end Tooling Survey 2018 - Ashley Nolan

Ashley will be sharing the result's and insights from this year's Front-End Tooling Survey. He'll also explain how the survey has evolved since the first edition in 2015, what's involved in putting it together each year and how he's learned first-hand why it's best not to publish blog posts just before going away on holiday.

so an interest he would come across my

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,919
survey before Adam posted out the link

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,849
okay that's got a few people that's good

00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:10,679
well as I mentioned this is not the

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,059
first time that I've run the survey it's

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,370
the third edition the first one launched

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,900
back in 2015 and it would be each

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,550
addition and they've been more or less

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,170
twelve months apart the exception was

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,520
this year because before then I was

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,560
running it kind of like October November

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,090
time I ended up like rushing it out

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,070
before Christmas and not really like

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,420
having the most fun before Christmas so

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,070
I thought I'll doing the new year and oh

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,890
give me plenty of time which is why I

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,170
moved it but why did I start doing in

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,180
the first place well before working it

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,010
just the place to work in London and I

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,899
worked for an agency without forever

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,850
front-end developers and we helped to

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,680
maintain an internal framework that we

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,300
used for the majority of our projects we

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,239
really greatly discussed the tools that

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,100
we thought our framework should move on

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,719
to and start using make sure we kept up

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,309
today and the framework and was kept up

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,079
to date but the biggest issue was that

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,270
you know while we'd like to keep up to

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,559
date and we thought you know we see a

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,180
new framework and think it was really

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,739
cool to see a new tool that we might

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,210
like to use it was really hard to

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,470
distinguish what was just generating a

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,360
lot of noise and what was actually being

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,400
used by people in the industry so that's

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,750
why I decided that it would be a really

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,549
good idea to maybe put together

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,720
something that might tell me some more

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,720
results and actually give us something

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,040
to quantify that the discussion we had

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,509
back then was actually like switching

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,970
from browser fire to web pack and why we

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,950
should do it and because back in 2015

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,970
web pack was still fair they knew we

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,340
couldn't decide whether that was

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,659
something that we should move towards

00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,189
and I think one of the things that all

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,470
developers should keep in mind really is

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,930
that what especially when discussed in

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,030
tooling it's not just what we personally

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,079
use and just because we work in a in a

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,700
certain way it doesn't mean that

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,350
everyone in the room will be working in

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,970
a certain way as well I think having a

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,100
survey like this really helps to kind of

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,380
show you different perspectives on how

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,659
people are working so with this in mind

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,399
I decided to put together the survey and

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,380
I asked developers on Twitter that's how

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,549
I started putting it out that was the

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,049
tweet back in August 2015 and I put it

00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,820
out on Survey Monkey that's how I wrote

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,130
it put together a blog post push the

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,020
link out to the usual sort of networks

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,360
like hacker news designer news echo

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,950
chess that kind of thing and in a couple

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,020
of weeks I've managed to get about 600

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,220
responses which I thought was really

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,890
good you know I was quite happy with it

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,720
I was my aim was about you know

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,270
up to 500 and I thought I'd be pretty

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,430
good be a decent number and so I wrote

00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,750
up the results in a blog post and it

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,390
just so happened I was going away on

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,400
holiday a couple of days in a couple of

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,990
days time and I decided I'd put the blog

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,190
post live I'll keep the survey open

00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,410
because obviously if people see the blog

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,180
post they might fill in the survey and I

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,220
went on a holiday to Peru which isn't

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,040
the best place for Wi-Fi if anyone's

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,720
beans Peru so I put it live got on my

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,390
plane and I didn't really think much

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,880
more about it until I arrived in our

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,830
first hostel connected to the Wi-Fi and

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,260
at which point my phone started melting

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,150
down from a load of at mentions that the

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,920
survey had start again on Twitter so it

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,600
turned out but a few people with fairly

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,250
large audiences on Twitter had mentioned

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,720
the results because while it's quite

00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,370
hard to get people to actually share a

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,440
link to a survey to fill in because

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,670
that's almost like begging once you've

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,410
got some information and you want to

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,209
share it it's super easy everyone wants

00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,680
to share you know that you know then

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:10,550
this framework is bigger than that

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,800
framework or whatever really so that was

00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,000
really awesome but the not so cool part

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,410
of that is that one of the biggest

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,350
things that I've learned for doing the

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,820
survey is if you don't plan for it go in

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,220
doing a lot better than you you kind of

00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,260
expect you can get into a bit of trouble

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,329
so the reason I say this is that while

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,070
Survey Monkey was super awesome and they

00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:30,320
had a free tier that lets you get about

00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,730
2,000 responses for free once you hit

00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,470
that limit they charge you for every

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,140
single response that you go over that

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,370
limit so in just overnight I had managed

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,410
to rack up about a hundred quids worth

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,380
of Survey Monkey fees and that wasn't

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,760
the best way to start my holiday so that

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,870
first year I had to turn it off while I

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,430
was on holiday because I couldn't really

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,019
do much about it when I was over there

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,299
and I didn't really make the most of the

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,130
publicity that it was getting and so we

00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,930
got about to show you in a second we got

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,269
about 2,000 responses that first year

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,280
which is why it kind of you know had six

00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,230
hundred two thousand i but it'd be great

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,660
to find out how many I could have got

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,950
that first year in future years I've

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,570
been really lucky that since I've been

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,769
just eat they actually have a Survey

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,600
Monkey account so I've kind of been

00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,400
using that and that has no limit which

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,070
is really awesome so we can actually

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,350
like see the full results come in

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,120
through then you have a major thing that

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,829
I've had to learn about fairly quickly

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,060
but I didn't really think about when I

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,690
started the survey is email

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,100
subscriptions and this is how email it's

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,860
not playing all the way through but

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,050
this is how email subscription services

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,240
make me feel basically they make me want

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:36,410
to smash up my computer he's not doing

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,240
it there so much but but what I didn't

00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,250
realize back then again if you use mail

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,080
chip MailChimp MailChimp is really

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,910
really awesome but it's kind of the

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,850
thing that MailChimp is built for is

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,530
quite a low regular audience so what I

00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,150
do when I run my survey is I run it

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,500
every year but it goes out to quite a

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,030
high number of people now I've got about

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,830
4,000 people on the mailing list

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,240
but don't you mail in the rest of the

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,400
year it's like two or three emails a

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,600
year but MailChimp is really good for if

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,830
you've got about 500 people in your

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,470
email and they have every single month

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:06,020
because it gives you about 1,000 to

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,120
2,000 people to send every every month

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,880
that's fine if you just send in that one

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,530
email every month so in the second year

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,520
I actually had to get around it I know

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,810
this had been recorded and they'll

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,760
probably sue me for this or something I

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,380
put together to serve a binky accounts

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,480
because I went over that 2,000 then sent

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,740
it out to the two sets of people but

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,420
then this year that was the unenviable I

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,610
had for phase and people that I had to

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,870
so I had to find a different service and

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,960
I'm now using something called email

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:32,270
octopus which is really cool it uses AWS

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,480
but that just means that I can pay a set

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,130
fee it uses AWS which email accounts is

00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,720
virtually nothing as about 10 pound a

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,600
month so I can just take that out for a

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,910
month or to pay 20 pounds rather than

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,610
like I think MailChimp subscriptions

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,050
when you get past 500 mm Zoe is

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,670
absolutely ridiculous I'd have to pay

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,620
about 120 pounds just for that

00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,200
subscription which is a bit crazy

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,930
because although I've started to get a

00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,610
bit more where's boss reached out to me

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,890
last year to do an affiliate scheme and

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,110
I get some money back then to pay for

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,900
certain aspects of the survey otherwise

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,060
I'm just running it on my free time so

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:11,390
so I have to try and do it for a smaller

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,800
budget as possible obviously now looking

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:16,580
at the number of responses in that first

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,180
year you'll see it went up to 2028 and

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,010
so I think it was 2000 but yeah those 28

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,660
people who went over there the people

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:27,610
who cost me that hundred payments which

00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:30,200
is the which is quite ridiculous really

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,060
2016 though because I've got some more

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,740
contacts from the first year putting

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,140
those results so it was a bit easier

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,490
getting those responses and I didn't

00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,689
leave it didn't actually leave the

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,059
results open too long and I

00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:43,669
at about 5,000 and then this year you'll

00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:44,869
see we've so far I haven't published the

00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,059
results yet so you're the first people

00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:48,499
to see the results I've got five days in

00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:50,419
them ninety-seven people have filled in

00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:52,309
so far which is really cool and every

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:53,629
year it does get a little bit easier to

00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:55,999
kind of get some more contacts because

00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:57,409
I've got contacts within newsletters now

00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,879
that I just kind of contact and they

00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,529
help me out with that sort of thing I

00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,749
was actually saying to Adam though it

00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:05,899
can be quite frustrating sometimes and

00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:07,669
you realize how big big websites can can

00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:09,529
run sometimes where they're more than

00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:11,089
happy like I say to publish the results

00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:13,219
once they're out but then you go back to

00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,809
them and try to get them to publish the

00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:16,519
link just through a survey please fill

00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,869
in and they just you know they're not

00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,989
interested in till those results come

00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:22,189
out which is a bit frustrating so as you

00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:24,110
can see I'm going to show you the

00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:26,419
results from these five players than 97

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,919
people today and I may mean to publish

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:29,329
these in the next couple of weeks so if

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,729
you are interested in seeing the full

00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:33,529
results published just keep an eye on my

00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:35,209
Twitter or my blog and they'll be up in

00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:36,949
the next few weeks as well and then what

00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:38,209
I usually do is a couple of weeks or

00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,969
about a month later or I'll update them

00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:44,569
with the full results if there's more

00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:46,969
people who'll answer it in that time so

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,589
yeah the results if any of you want to

00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:50,899
shout out what you think the answers are

00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:52,550
when I go through them that's heartily

00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:55,129
encouraged some of them are quite

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,619
predictable what I would say is there's

00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:59,569
been a couple of big swings which are

00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:01,969
probably quite predictable in terms of

00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:03,379
like the actual swing but probably it's

00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:05,059
quite what I found was it was quite

00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:08,149
surprising to the amount of the swings

00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:09,469
and some things which I'm sure you'll

00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:13,429
all be able to guess which one's the

00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:16,039
most popular each so starting at the top

00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:17,179
the survey asks all respondents to rate

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,989
their experience and their knowledge

00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:22,939
levels in CSS and JavaScript as well as

00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:24,349
this is to give a bit more context

00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,929
during the rest of the answers means you

00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,279
can filter each question by you know

00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:30,319
experience level how long people have

00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,120
worked in the industry and also how

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,250
people write their CSS and JavaScript

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,979
not levels so it's good because you can

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,959
look at if beginners are using tools

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,370
more than experienced people and which

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,559
tools they're using as they're picking

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,180
up JavaScript and CSS and equally you

00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,769
can look at if these bigger frameworks

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,360
that we all know about are just being

00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:49,550
used by experienced people or if they're

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,529
being used by beginners as well and it's

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,689
also important notes you

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,810
gauged the ability like I say with the

00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:58,160
knowledge levels but you have to kind of

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,589
quantify this a bit because obviously if

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,720
I ask someone if they're amazing in CSS

00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:04,249
that's them rating themselves you have

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,899
to take that with a pinch of salt but

00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:07,129
equally you kind of expect if someone

00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,050
says they're an expert they probably

00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:11,269
aren't a beginner so it gives you a

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,999
vague idea of what people people's

00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:17,569
knowledge levels are at least so looking

00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:19,069
at this year's respondents over 50 54 %

00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:21,139
have been working in the industry for

00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:22,370
over five years now which means the

00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,629
majority of people filling out the

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,279
survey this year have a fairly high

00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,050
level experience in front-end

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,309
technologies so you can see not that

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,740
many people have less than two years

00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:34,100
experience and once it goes over that is

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,050
the majority of people really comparing

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,360
this to the results have lost last time

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,220
I run it which this is obviously I run

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,430
this about a month ago I suppose the

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,499
survey and that the results in 2006 16

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:47,180
came out in December says about 14

00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:50,389
months difference but it's actually

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,339
remarkably similar so which you know all

00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,240
although I'm not sure you can draw loads

00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:54,980
out of this because you might get

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,019
different samples of people but it's

00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,629
quite interesting to see almost exactly

00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:01,069
the same split but I did think looking

00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:03,050
at this is that perhaps there's not a

00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:04,579
massive influx of new people coming into

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,540
the industry and filling out surveys and

00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:07,220
whether this is because we're not

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,379
getting lots of new people picking up

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,809
CSS and JavaScript or just that they're

00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:13,939
not into filling it now surveys it's

00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:15,559
hard to tell but you know readings that

00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:17,059
whatever whatever you want what these

00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,910
become more interesting as we go through

00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:22,610
and filter based on these sort of yearly

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:25,430
experiences as we as we go through the

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,290
different questions looking at how

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,759
respondents rated their knowledge in CSS

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,230
and JavaScript there there's also a

00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,600
similar pattern to last year's results

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,399
where about 60% of people consider

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,370
themselves to be either advanced or

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,050
expert in CSS compared to about 53% say

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,929
and the same with their JavaScript

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,639
skills it's obviously as with any

00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:44,629
question and question regarding

00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,870
knowledge like I say it's quite

00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:49,309
subjective but what you can kind of

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,860
gauge from this is that people probably

00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:53,420
consider that CSS is slightly easier to

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,790
become an expert or more advanced in

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,170
because they're more people are taken

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,110
that view and filling that out and

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,519
saying that but either way like I say

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,019
the vast majority of respondents

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,730
consider themselves to be at an

00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,560
intermediate level or higher in

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,940
CSS and JavaScript and not many people

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,280
are saying that they're beginners or

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,630
novice the vast majority of both of

00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,360
these charts are saying that there at

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,160
least intermediate level I'll refer back

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,300
to these as I say as I go through the

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,650
different questions especially the

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,690
experience levels cuz I mean it's quite

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:24,350
interesting to see what people are

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:26,480
actually using so the first I know I

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,770
meant in a JavaScript name meetup but

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,870
I'll start with all the CSS stuff and

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:34,040
get on to the JavaScript stuff later but

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:35,990
I asked people what CSS preprocessors

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,360
they use and I'm sure most people will

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,340
probably be able to guess the results of

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,690
this one because it hasn't changed quite

00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,920
so much certainly one oh yes yes so this

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,850
one's probably the most one of the most

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,280
stable ones that in terms of usage in

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,600
fact I didn't think such usage could get

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,060
too much higher but actually went up

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,560
about 2% since the last time I thought

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,010
it might stay about the same or even go

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,500
down but it hasn't no preprocessor did

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,300
actually go up a little bit as well they

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,150
the only other ones other than sass to

00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,230
go up what post CSS no no preprocessor

00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,030
although the others actually went down

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:15,590
and I think less usage went down about

00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:17,150
4% which is quite interesting I think

00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,320
this can be a little bit of an unfair

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,830
question in some ways because a lot of

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,720
people do use post CSS as well as suss

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,190
myself included but as you say I kind of

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,560
word the questions say like if you had

00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,690
to pick one then go for it I might look

00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,670
at in future years trying to see if

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,410
people use multiple tools as well so I

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,480
think I'd be quite interested in Oh CSS

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,370
might actually start to climb I think

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,260
then but usage of post CSS actually

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,540
since they started the server back in

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,100
2015 has slowly grown and as you'll see

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,400
from the knowledge levels in this one

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,890
you can see the blue is people feeling

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,300
comfortable in and this level here has

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,080
actually gone up consistently as well

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,800
over the last few years

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,090
although sass is by far the most that

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,220
the tool that people feel most

00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:02,930
comfortable using the next question is

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,210
was actually a result of feedback from

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,640
developers asking me to include this so

00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,020
this wasn't something that I kind of

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,190
thought it was a tool but I was like on

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,650
earth shall I put frameworks and

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,820
everyone knows that people use bootstrap

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,170
how much do I want I liked indicate

00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:19,399
bootstrap people

00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:22,189
so I was like oh I'll see so I asked

00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:24,019
people which of the following CSS for it

00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:27,559
very much do most frequently used and

00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:29,119
what I actually thought I although I

00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:31,579
thought bootstrap would be very popular

00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:33,290
it was actually quite surprised by the

00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:34,579
the split of how people were using

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,829
frameworks and it was quite interesting

00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:38,480
actually so it turns out that it's

00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:40,819
actually incredibly close that bootstrap

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,439
does come top if you take out the fact

00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:44,569
that people who aren't using a framework

00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:46,879
or custom frameworks and then you split

00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:48,379
out all the other frameworks it's

00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,819
actually about the same so the people

00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:52,069
who are either doing their own thing or

00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:53,449
not using anything is about the same as

00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:54,649
all the people using frameworks which I

00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:56,149
think was quite interesting because I

00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:58,189
thought bootstrap might actually kind of

00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,749
override a lot of that and there's

00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:01,939
actually incredibly high number using

00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:03,139
custom frameworks as well if you

00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:05,660
actually start to drill down into

00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:07,910
experience levels this actually goes up

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,540
quite dramatically as well with 40 n 48

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:14,119
percent people starting out with about a

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,419
years experience use bootstrap so that

00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:19,910
goes up you know 14 percent so people

00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:21,649
who are learning CSS obviously are going

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,079
to bootstrap rather than just learn CSS

00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,549
which I think you know most people would

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,169
probably guess but it's interesting to

00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:29,720
see that quantified in the results as

00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:31,699
well and this figure actually drops to

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,379
30 percent so 30 only 30 percent of

00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:37,939
people use bootstrap with over five

00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:40,730
years experience 53 percent of those

00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:42,559
developers either not have a don't have

00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,749
a preferred framework or use their own

00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,720
custom framework over 53 percent as well

00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:49,759
so that I think it comes to about 48

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,309
percent that goes over the 50 percent if

00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,889
you look at people who with over five

00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:57,769
years experience so it seems you know as

00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:59,839
they say probably not too surprising but

00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,279
the more experienced you become the less

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,019
like you are to use an off-the-shelf

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,819
framework and the more likely you are to

00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:06,470
either do use a custom framework or to

00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:08,480
use no framework tool which I think you

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,649
know again natural but it's good to see

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,980
it in the figures that it's kind of

00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:14,509
reflected like that as well

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,399
CSS naming schemes next so this is

00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:17,660
something that I I really like CSS

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,699
naming scheme is quite passionate about

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,049
them and I started asking this last year

00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:25,069
just I have interest to see if people

00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:27,289
actually do use them I didn't ask you a

00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:29,030
specific usage in this I asked about

00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:31,400
Behrman tools like that later

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:33,260
this is just more do you use a naming

00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,000
scheme at all and just to kind of get

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,840
knowledge levels of naming schemes that

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,850
at all in the first place so looking at

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,170
the results the number of developers

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,940
using the name and scheme has gone up

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,910
since the last survey so you can see

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,310
it's gone up four percent since the 2016

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,600
survey and the people who have heard of

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,940
naming schemes but don't use them has

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,410
also gone up but at least the the people

00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,210
who have not heard of naming scheme has

00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,790
actually gone down which I think's quite

00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,320
good because a tool that helps you with

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,960
your maintenance your CSS it's good to

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,280
see that overall percentage of people at

00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,700
least know innovator and reading about

00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,080
it going up and I think they are really

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,790
useful as well so it's also quite

00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,130
encouraging like stuff like testing to

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,190
see these sort of trends getting picked

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,420
up by people coming through as well

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:22,310
similarly the next question was about

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:23,690
CSS Linton and last year about 46% of

00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,370
people said that they'll entered their

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:33,170
CSS so do you think that number has gone

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:37,640
up or down since last year it's actually

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:41,420
gone almost bang on 50% sir so it's gone

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:43,790
up from 46% up to forty nine point nine

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,440
percent so almost that like the point

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,450
may where more people lint their CSS

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,280
than don't which is again awesome

00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,660
because one of the things I was most

00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,220
surprised that last time around the

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,350
survey was the number of people who

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,240
hadn't heard of a tool called style lint

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,890
which is absolutely awesome if you

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,740
haven't heard of that tool it's

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:03,560
basically a lot of people think of CSS

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,820
lint in as the old style - tools that

00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,920
give you so many rules that you just

00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,470
don't want to stick to Stalin is bit

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,030
more like yes lint and things like that

00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,580
where you can depict that the rules that

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,920
you want and so you don't have to abide

00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,470
by all of the random CSS rules that's

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:23,240
old tools like CSS lint tended to put in

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:25,100
place so again it's really useful to see

00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,170
this really good to see this trending

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,580
upwards at least and I think that again

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,810
if you haven't looked into this sort of

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,430
thing I definitely recommend it because

00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,410
it gets rid of a lot of the we found

00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,910
using it just the it gets rid of a lot

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,260
of really niggly code reviews things

00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,250
that you just don't want to mention that

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,470
it just takes care of all that stuff

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:45,230
and the next question was all about new

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,789
and shiny things in CSS so although

00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,380
these aren't strictly tools I was really

00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:51,230
interested to see there's so much noise

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,549
about CSS grid custom properties and

00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,630
things like that I really wanted to know

00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:55,850
how many people are actually starting to

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:59,059
use these things so I thought I put it

00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,919
in as a question in the survey so the

00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,960
question asked was how would they rate

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,820
their experience level with grid flexbox

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,980
and custom properties and the results

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,919
were actually pretty interesting so you

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,500
can see flexbox now a huge number of

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,630
people found that they were comfortable

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,250
with flexbox 68% people said that they

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,900
were comfortable with it which goes to

00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,370
show that you know flexbox has been

00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,770
around for quite a while now but people

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,059
are actually really do feel comes toward

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,549
the syntax and actually using it in

00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:27,020
projects by the looks of it I was quite

00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:29,330
surprised that custom properties

00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,580
actually had 19% of people who feel felt

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:35,120
comfortable using it and CSS grid only

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,470
had 18% which I thought grid with so you

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,120
know it's had so much noise over the

00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,280
last six months I mean if you look at

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,600
the used a little it does wipe the floor

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,730
with custom properties so it doesn't you

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,770
know lots of people are getting into it

00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,760
and starting to learn it but I thought

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,049
that was really interesting because I

00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,330
didn't think custom properties although

00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:52,400
it's coming through hasn't had quite the

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:55,460
number of you know the amount of push as

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,049
C as a squid has but it looks like all

00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,549
three of them are actually you know

00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,770
people have used them at least a little

00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:02,539
bit or they are at least hearing about

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,490
and reading and flexbox if you're not

00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,720
already using it it looks like that if

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,520
you went to a job interview today

00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,720
you'd be pretty much expected to know

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,620
about it because you know a lot of

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,620
people are using it now

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,090
so my final CSS question was around CSS

00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:20,390
methodologies and this is about finding

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,950
out what actually people use like I was

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,950
mentioning about the naming scheme stuff

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,270
like them autoprefixer tools like that

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,970
they help you and your CSS and

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,039
methodologies that might help you as

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,720
well so there's stuff like smacks and

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,450
things like that you might know if you

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,940
into your CSS so what did the results

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,260
look like for this

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,030
well white last year the tools that are

00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,549
most popular we're still up there as

00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:46,190
well so stuff like autoprefixer

00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,539
BEM got quite a high result so this is

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,490
multi choice by the way so people could

00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:50,920
name as many of these that they use in

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,380
their projects

00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,440
and then closely followed by so you've

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,270
got autoprefixer moderniser which you

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,700
you know you probably all expect those

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:04,180
to be quite high and then CSS modules

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,950
actually you know if we'll show you the

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,710
table in a second that has come

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:11,440
massively up in the last 14 months and

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,970
stuff and styling again I said last time

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,470
I think it got about 8% I'm gonna show

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,510
you the table in a second I'll confirm

00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,130
it but that's starting to get knowledge

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,600
levels of people actually really use in

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:23,500
that now and it's really encouraging see

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,150
tools like that and come through what

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,300
was interested as well was that although

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:30,070
atomic design held true and it was about

00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,050
15% of usage that's about the same as

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,660
last time a lot of the other CSS

00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:36,040
methodologies has actually dropped down

00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,370
so this was the full table I could

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:42,460
assign so you'll see the author prefixed

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,260
remem their knowledge levels and usage

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,330
levels have gone up moderniser had

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,710
actually dropped about 9% which is

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,330
interesting people obviously feeling

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,690
like then they don't need moderniser as

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:56,220
much anymore but CSS modules and Starlin

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:58,150
have gone up 10% in it almost 9%

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,610
respectively which i think is quite

00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,860
interested in and shows a trend upwards

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,350
for those and as we go into some of the

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,210
other tools later you'll see CSS and j s

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,970
get mentioned as well a bit later as

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:14,050
well yeah like I said something stuff

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:15,520
like smacks and object-oriented CSS and

00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,380
actually dropped off quite considerably

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,790
I think this is probably where CSS

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,580
modules is probably taken the place of

00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,260
those and people are using more CSS and

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,690
jeaious and flip in for those rather

00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,790
than the more architectural patterns and

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:31,240
so people come in in I think atomic

00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:32,680
design is still quite well promoted out

00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,180
there they're still some people who

00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,460
really push it I think the other ones

00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,630
are kind of fallen by the wayside a bit

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,950
as new people come through they're

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:45,280
probably not the first thing you hit as

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:48,580
you as you learn CSS right so that's the

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,040
end of the CSS kind of stuff um but

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,290
we're now firmly into JavaScript and

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,110
tooling stuff now so the next question I

00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:57,550
wanted to show was for task runners so I

00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,740
don't include webpack in this just

00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,420
because I include web pack as a bundler

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,610
rather than a task runner which is kind

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,100
of a it's hard to quantify web pack does

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,480
everything

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,580
you know you can't include in all the

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,930
questions but people can include it in

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,230
other if they really feel like it as

00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,990
well

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,060
but this is more about gulp grunt NPM

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,100
scripts that kind of thing so this

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,290
historically was a question that built

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,630
had been pretty dominant in current

00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,730
usage should you trended downwards and

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,550
gulp had kind of taken over a lot of

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,450
what grunted let go and NPM scripts

00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,300
looked like they were becoming more

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,530
popular when I did the survey last this

00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,510
was one of the ones I was massively

00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,220
surprised by the swing actually so NPM

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,260
scripts that like absolutely wiped the

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,740
floor with all the others I mean it it

00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,600
went up 22 percent since last time which

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,340
actually when you dug when I dug down

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,990
into the results it was a lot of the

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,330
beginners actually rather than going for

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,980
a tool they were actually going for NPM

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,930
scripts which kind of makes sense that

00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,340
if you're learning JavaScript and you

00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,690
learn NPM and that kind of thing

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,160
rather than picking up tool you might go

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,630
for the most you know one of the simpler

00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,630
ways of doing things and that his NPM

00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,970
scripts actually the people with under

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,740
two years experience that went up

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,150
slightly to I think went up to about

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,430
fifty percent so they were above average

00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,200
above the average where the other

00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:12,080
developers were still using some of the

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,520
other tools so got usage although still

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,110
pretty high I mean is still about a

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,540
third of people are still using gulp so

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,250
it's not low by any means it did drop

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,200
fourteen percent though since last time

00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,720
compared to NPM scripts going up 22

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,970
percent that is quite a big swing and I

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,620
think this is probably down to a bit of

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,480
tooling fatigue as well people wanting

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,090
to simplify things and their task

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,880
managers and feeling like they don't

00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,770
necessarily need to use something local

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:41,060
which you know and switch into NPM

00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:43,400
scripts like I say for beginners in

00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,840
terms of module bundlers as well so this

00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,570
does include stuff like web pack

00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,800
browserify JSP em all of the stuff that

00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:53,510
bundle up your JavaScript to run runtime

00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,370
as you would expect it's not a massive

00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,950
surprise but again

00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,350
web pack now is hugely hugely dominant

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:02,330
sixty six percent of people so that's

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,100
more people using webpack now than are

00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,170
using sass which is you know pretty

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:10,000
pretty massive really a massive massive

00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:13,550
percentage of people respond in that way

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,840
people not using a bundler went down and

00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,250
a lot of them obviously started using

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,630
webpack because that's where a lot of

00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,630
the results went

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:22,340
and things like JSP em what JSP em I

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,110
don't know if anyone follows JSP em but

00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,450
it's been in beta for like the last like

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,770
18 months I really wanted to use JSP em

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,260
but we can't use it in production while

00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,580
it's in PETA and they just can't seem to

00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,170
get there it's a really cool tool so

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,510
whenever it does get released it might

00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,400
get some traction but I think web pack

00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:43,160
now is you know by far and away the

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:45,080
biggest module button learning in terms

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,050
of the experience levels as well so this

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,720
was looking across task runners and

00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:52,280
bundlers so you can see even though gulp

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,530
usage has gone down it's still very

00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,130
widely known so if you use it and you

00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,250
hire someone

00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:01,760
chances are isn't you know about 50% of

00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,960
people know how to use got so there's no

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,790
worries in terms of that if you like

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,030
using it again a third of people use a

00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:11,150
50% people know it it's not not no bad

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:13,490
thing by any means to use it right NPM

00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,650
scripts the knowledge levels are really

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,440
on the up and like say this trend back

00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:21,590
to the the other survey where last year

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,870
where a lot of people this year compared

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:27,020
to last year and now using NPM scripts

00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,980
and the knowledge levels going up I was

00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,390
a little bit surprised actually about

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,280
parcel because I had heard a lot of

00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:34,010
things about parcel and so I was really

00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,120
like in previous surveys when I haven't

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,970
heard about the tool I hear a lot of

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,710
noise I think like view last time even

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,690
though you didn't do tremendously well

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:43,940
last time it was clear it was trending

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,560
upwards whereas parcel I heard a lot

00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,780
about and it didn't do particularly well

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:52,760
so I was like ya know there's a lot of

00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:54,650
noise to a certain extent and so this is

00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,650
probably one of the most interesting

00:25:54,650 --> 00:26:01,130
questions in the survey is around survey

00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:03,320
tool frameworks and JavaScript tools and

00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:06,320
so there are three main questions in

00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,030
this the first one is around which

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,490
libraries and frameworks to people have

00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,140
experience and so people respond if you

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,700
know like a certain like the other ones

00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,740
like where they feel comfortable in them

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,240
whether they know them a little bit or

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,150
whether they just read about them in

00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,410
that kind of thing and looking at this

00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,780
graph hopefully you can all see that

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:25,940
it's quite a big graph this is kind of

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,130
split out into different chunks and the

00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,470
blue ones are the blue columns are what

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,130
people feel comfortable in use little as

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,590
the light of

00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,600
and it goes down as throughout each of

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,669
them and you can see predictably 80% of

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,049
people feel comfortable using jQuery

00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:42,169
what's really interesting about that

00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:45,140
number is actually that's down 6% from

00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:46,460
14 months ago and what's really

00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,530
interesting about that is actually when

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,760
you drill down into the results and

00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,160
people with less than two years

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:56,299
experience only 50% of people actually

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,500
felt comfortable using jQuery so which

00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:59,000
is really bizarre right because you

00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,549
think beginners we're picking up jQuery

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,660
but it turns out they're not and as

00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:04,340
you'll see as we go through the results

00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,710
to the other questions actually more

00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,049
beginners what we're saying that react

00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,600
was important to them than jQuery which

00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:13,610
is was massively surprising I thought

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,700
that jQuery would still be you know have

00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:18,350
all of the kind of cross-sections of

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,610
people but I thought it was really

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,530
interesting that beginners literally

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,240
weren't feeling comfortable and using

00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,409
that they were just not feeling income

00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,090
you know they just weren't learning it

00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:28,669
then even though a lot of them had used

00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,140
a little hood read a renovator you know

00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:31,820
they they weren't saying that they felt

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,960
comfortable using it which was really

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,309
interesting to me because I thought that

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,860
would be one of the tools that they

00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:40,159
would genuinely obviously know quite

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:41,570
well out the other tools the most

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,260
well-known were obviously then react

00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:47,840
react came second low - which is you

00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:50,299
know far and away as you'll see through

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,669
some of the usage stats it's much gets a

00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:54,530
lot more score than underscore does when

00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,020
angular one actually beats angular 2

00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,760
plus like it did last time so I thought

00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,049
that angular 2 plus might actually gain

00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,789
some more traction of people coming over

00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:03,559
from angular 1 we doesn't seem like

00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:07,100
that's actually happening and it hasn't

00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:08,539
grown massively since the last survey if

00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,400
you actually did quite well as well

00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:12,260
compared to last time and it's all quite

00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,270
a big upswing and I will go through the

00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,900
other questions you'll see that sort of

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:19,820
pattern repeated so the second framework

00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,500
question then asked which tool do you

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,179
currently use most frequently and again

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,100
this is multiple choice so you don't to

00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:28,730
pick one if people use jQuery and react

00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,830
they can choose both it's fine so what

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:34,159
would people frequently use in on their

00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:37,340
projects and you can see jQuery just

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,200
about mix it but if you look back to the

00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,900
old survey what's really interesting

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,960
about this is that that swing from last

00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,779
year about 14 months ago survey

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,419
j.crew is up at 70% and react was down

00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:52,850
at 35 percent so that swing is like

00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:55,039
about 30 percent in 14 months which is

00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,600
pretty incredible that you know people

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,250
are just you know dropping away from

00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,570
jQuery and moving over to react and

00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,789
again if you look at this with the

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,529
people under two years again these

00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:05,870
averages were actually going up for a

00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:07,190
react in those in those categories which

00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,870
is really interested in to me cuz I

00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,940
thought again that would be one of the

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:15,230
ones that more people would be used in

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,940
jQuery so comparing it's the last set of

00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,820
results Jake we had almost double the

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,279
responses last time and now it's

00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,299
literally down to about three percent I

00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,940
think the second thing that's really

00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:28,850
interest in though is the view usage so

00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,260
I was down at 23% this is actually more

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,419
than doubled in the last last time

00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,399
survey which was you know I thought the

00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:37,159
view usage would go up but again it's

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,929
gone up quite a lot and usage is almost

00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,270
more than both angular 1 and angular 2

00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:42,799
plus combined which is you know quite

00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:45,320
impressive for a tool that's not being

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,570
around anywhere near as long as them and

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,490
it you could arguably say if you look at

00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,899
the next questions results that it's

00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,929
probably no the second most popular

00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:56,510
framework so again here the swings

00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:58,220
you'll see jQuery went down almost 20%

00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:01,159
since last time in terms of where people

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:04,789
frequently use it on their projects and

00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:06,740
react went up obey 11 percent underscore

00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:08,630
usage went down and lodash went up so

00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,250
you can see lodash is pretty much if

00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,750
people were reaching for utility library

00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,390
now that's that's the one I think it's

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,130
probably because it's a lot more modular

00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,529
and it's a bit more performant an

00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,029
underscore so people are naturally going

00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:23,390
towards that as they're making their

00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:24,470
applications more modular angular one

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,600
usage is going down

00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,789
angular 2 usage isn't going up as much

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,990
compared to the angular 1 usage going

00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:33,970
down as well which I thought was quite

00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:37,580
interesting and the final question is

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:39,409
what the developer actually considers

00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,090
the most essential thing that they're

00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:42,169
using on the majority of their project

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,940
so this one they only get to pick one

00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:45,260
and they you know they can choose

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,210
nothing so they can say nothing's

00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,149
essential or they can pick one of those

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:53,179
frameworks or tools and this was really

00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:54,740
interesting again so the results here

00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:57,049
are confirming the trend really react is

00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,410
now considered the most essential tool

00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:01,140
to the most number of develop

00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:03,300
in this survey so last year j.crew was

00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,100
top with 32% it's actually falling down

00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,080
behind nothing

00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,350
so people consider nothing more useful

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,270
than jQuery potentially but still you

00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,380
know not to be like Dane on jQuery

00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,180
because I think it's a really cool tool

00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,010
a lot of people are still finding it

00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,810
useful right so there's still 20% of

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,580
people who consider the most essential

00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,600
tool which if you compare it to a lot of

00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,940
the other tools it's still an incredible

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,350
amount you know it's still only 10

00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,150
percent behind react

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,070
I think the negative for it is that it's

00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,290
trending downwards and so it's you know

00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,210
it's lost about 12% so again if you look

00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:39,960
at the swings you go back if you wanna

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:41,100
take a picture you'll also see the other

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,660
interesting thing about this though

00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,910
showing about the old question is if you

00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:48,480
look at view more people consider view

00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:50,460
to be essential to them than either an

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,840
angular 2 plus which is you know it's

00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,610
quite a substantial amount bigger as

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,990
well so again like I said it's probably

00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:58,980
considered now the second biggest

00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:00,240
framework like say the swings you react

00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,800
gained about 11 percent and this

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,380
question and jQuery dropped about 12 and

00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,510
a half percent so you know it's quite

00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,490
big swings again like although react was

00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,190
coming through I didn't think the swings

00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:13,110
off jQuery and into react would be quite

00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:16,230
as large but again if you filter down

00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:18,030
into the experience levels the people

00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,770
with under two years experience were

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,540
actually averaging above the average

00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:23,310
whereas I thought they'd be below the

00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,380
average of react so you know whereas

00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,610
that was twenty apes and people with

00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,430
under two years experience was about

00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:32,070
thirty percent so more people with under

00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:34,920
two years experience considered react to

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,450
be essential to them than the average

00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,920
which is incredible I thought I was

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,130
really interesting to kind of see that

00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,330
come through so I think the one thing

00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,250
you can kind of take away from that is

00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,750
that it looks like people who are

00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,700
starting to pick up JavaScript I

00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,290
starting with things like react mint and

00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,960
that's what they're heading straight

00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:54,720
into as much as native because obviously

00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:59,460
the people saying nan are essential or

00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,740
is also going up so on for the last few

00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,090
questions these are around just some

00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,460
stuff that people might use around

00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,870
JavaScript and although like some of

00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,580
these might be quite obvious hopefully

00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,630
to people in the room where the trends

00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,440
ago and I feel still think it's quite

00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,330
interesting to look at the data for them

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,920
so the first woman's about transpiling

00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:17,590
and I added this question last year

00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,060
because of Babel was being quite you

00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,940
know highly used and I thought was

00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:24,400
interesting and Babel usage last year

00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:27,850
was just about coming through is just

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,230
over 50% this year lots and lots of

00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,210
people are transpiring their code as it

00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:34,540
turns out so like I say I think there's

00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:37,330
about 60% last time it's about 77 77 and

00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:40,240
a half percent now and the people who

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,860
haven't last time out people had not

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,570
even heard transpilers and that's going

00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,950
down and the people who have heard of it

00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,540
and haven't used it it's also going down

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,210
so more people are transpile in their

00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,920
code and this is as you can see it's one

00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,690
of the biggest percentages in the actual

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,460
survey it's actually becoming really

00:33:52,690 --> 00:34:00,010
industry standard to use a tool like

00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:02,110
Babel Jeff's unit testing as well so

00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:04,720
this is obviously asking people if they

00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:08,230
use a unit testing tool and what they

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,300
use so this was actually what made the

00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,160
survey in the first year go let you know

00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,300
people start mentioning it because it

00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,770
turned out that not many people were

00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,540
unit testing their code and though

00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,490
everyone was up in arms and like why has

00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,870
no one unit tested and you know but

00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,270
actually since that since then the last

00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:24,760
survey it did actually break through 50

00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:27,010
percent to people unit testing and this

00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,070
year just seems to be like winning the

00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:32,169
hearts of developers and it swung up

00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:34,840
massively in terms of usage so it's gone

00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:37,330
up 18 percent since last time out so

00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,370
just is actually it's the tool I've used

00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,669
actually I've never really used testing

00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:43,480
tools before but I found just like

00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:46,300
incredibly easy to set up and this

00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,620
probably why it's doing so well it's I

00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,419
think it's a lot more user friendly than

00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,790
some of the old tools like kuna and

00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:54,240
stuff that you know might be a little

00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:57,100
bit historically harder to get into

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,320
still quite a few people don't use a

00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:02,020
tool to test their Jess but not 50% of

00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,360
people at least 43% of people don't but

00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,920
equally I don't think that's like a you

00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,710
know those people need to be extricated

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,910
and pitchforks because you know at the

00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,830
end of the day you don't need to

00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,360
necessarily unit test all of your code

00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,430
if you're in an agency and writing a

00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,410
project for a month you know you might

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,700
not whereas if you're right in a massive

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,170
application that's going to change over

00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,550
years and years it's probably better

00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,670
idea it's unit test your code because

00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,560
then it's a lot more bust so so yeah but

00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,540
it's good that this is

00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,130
in down low so the people not using unit

00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,040
tests and tools are actually going down

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:34,500
and those knowledge levels are going up

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,730
and the final question so this was the

00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,980
first time I asked this question as well

00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,240
this is more because I used John I was

00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,840
really interested to see if people use

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,910
John so it's a bit of a selfish one but

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,370
you know again just interesting to see

00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:50,340
the results so it's nothing to compare

00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:54,240
to last time but NPM usage is still

00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:56,370
really really high so yarn is 30% NPM is

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,330
about double that which you know quite

00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:00,270
interesting I thought it might be a

00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:02,790
little bit closer but I suspect if you'd

00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:04,470
asked this year ago then hardly anyone

00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,270
would be using yarn so I imagine then if

00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,500
you looked at the swing it would be a

00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,840
lot higher they'd be interested in

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,610
though know the NPM seems to be doing a

00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,590
lot of things that young is looking to

00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:17,520
do be interested in if this stays the

00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:19,020
same or swings either way but yeah it'd

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,430
be interesting to see those results next

00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:25,230
time so that's the majority the results

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,070
that I've you know can go into today

00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,390
other thing there's some really

00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,640
interesting stuff especially around the

00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,710
