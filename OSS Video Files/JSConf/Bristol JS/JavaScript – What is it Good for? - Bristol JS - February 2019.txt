Title: JavaScript â€“ What is it Good for? - Bristol JS - February 2019
Publication date: 2019-03-11
Playlist: Bristol JS
Description: 
	Ian Pouncey

The answer is "user experience". If JavaScript is running in someone's browser and isn't making their experience of your site or application better then what is it doing there? From making forms easier to use to adding audio notifications, this talk will cover some of the things that only JavaScript can do to improve user experience.

okay so first thing I want to say is

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,679
that I'd like you to get involved and

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,500
encourage you to ask questions as I go

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,830
along make one of the comments you want

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:21,720
just stick up your hand and I'll point

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to you and invite you to speak if we're

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,269
running long I'll you know talk to you

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,310
later

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,019
but you have to get involved it's much

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,279
more fun for me I'm a lot less nervous

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,660
if people involve this more of a

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,440
conversation than just me doing here

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,860
doing a presentation you know because it

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,739
gets pretty boring it might also help to

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,739
know a bit about my background I think

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:46,020
so I a former client side web developer

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,660
and before that I was probably what

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,390
you'd call the full stack developer then

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,399
we just meant that I was working pretty

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,750
much on my own or on a very small team

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,640
and had to do everything I've worked on

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,589
a few things you might have heard of so

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:07,590
the Yahoo homepage in around 2010 that

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,960
sort of time and I was one of the people

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,689
who wrote the client-side framework that

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,270
all the BBC websites run on so if you've

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,520
visited a BBC website anytime in

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,009
Leicester about eight years you've

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,020
probably seen some of my work that

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,790
includes little things like click

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,670
tracking and all that's of an analytics

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,650
stuff - cookie management and then more

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,000
obvious things like the header and

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,680
footer

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,840
you might notice this sort of thing that

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,869
just to give me a confidence boost my

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,000
sister told me that the six-year-old she

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:44,189
teaches could have done that with

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,460
powerpoints so you know it took us it

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,159
took us ages to do so it's one of those

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,689
things is it looks simple and it's you

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,560
know trying to get it working on

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,930
millions of web pages is on the plus

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,549
side and a former colleague of mine once

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,649
asked tim peake if anyone on the

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,689
international space station had ever

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,189
looked at the BBC website and they have

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,530
so that means I've got code that's

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,940
running space or at least as close to as

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,450
you're gonna get which is pretty pretty

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:16,090
cool but my job these days is is I

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,730
moved into accessibility as a full-time

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,980
role so my job really now is from

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,379
helping designers and developers create

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,940
accessible websites and I spend a lot

00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:31,330
more time thinking about user experience

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,739
than I do about code these days and my

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,140
views which I'm going to show to you a

00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:37,380
little bit about JavaScript and and its

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,860
purpose almost is is to some extent

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:44,500
informed by that transition so my talk

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,959
is based on a simple idea and that is

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,739
that if you have code JavaScript in this

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,849
case that is running on someone in

00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:53,200
someone's browser that they've

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:55,769
downloaded and it's running on their

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,110
machine then that code should always

00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:02,620
have a potential to improve the user

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:07,060
experience and if not then it probably

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:09,220
shouldn't be there so does anyone

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,620
disagree with me have examples of why I

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:16,329
might be wrong did I came prepared

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,190
so I thought people might say well ads

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,109
well how do they improve the user

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,700
experience well the fact is that a lot

00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:23,829
of sites run ads and if they didn't have

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,290
ads there'd be no site because there's

00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:28,750
no one paying for it so it's terrible as

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,889
they may be that you know they're there

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,540
for a reason or tracking now this is

00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,700
kind of an interesting one I think that

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,530
a lot of companies just you know they

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,549
build a website they'll put Google

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,930
Analytics on it without really thinking

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,540
about it and then they'll never look at

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,900
it well if you're tracking people and

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,069
then not using the data to inform say

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,829
the content you're going to put on the

00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:52,090
website you know if you a new site you

00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,440
know should we write this sort of

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,569
article rather than this sort of article

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,799
or things like that then the tracking

00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,200
doesn't help anyone just knowing that

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,609
you know X thousand people visited a

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,380
page if you're not doing anything with

00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:07,180
the data you know not using that data to

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,130
inform a better user experience then

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,540
again probably shouldn't be there but

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:15,160
I'm glad you all agree with me makes it

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:21,370
a lot easier so is anyone familiar with

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:23,740
Maslow's hierarchy of needs not good so

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,580
it's a theory of psychological

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,800
development

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:35,430
proposed by Abraham Maslow in check

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:38,540
notes 1943 and he believed that needs

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:42,810
work needed to pass through different

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:46,020
phrases to to meet what humans required

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:52,260
so they go from meeting psychological

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:54,330
needs to you know you know just some

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:58,380
really basic stuff so psychological

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,310
safety needs so to breathe sort of

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,720
physiological I keep saying

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,020
psychological physiological so third to

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,390
brief food to eat that sort of thing to

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,320
you know a safe place to sleep that sort

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,270
of thing all the way through to

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,660
self-actualization so being the best

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,910
sort of person that you can be living to

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,920
your your your potential now there's a

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,210
downside to Maslow in that he actually

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,030
wasn't really interested in

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,610
accessibility or inclusivity at all

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,980
he only included the healthiest people

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,410
he could find basically younger students

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,860
at universities in his studies and he

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,230
said the study of crippled stunted

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,890
immature and unhealthy specimens can

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:41,310
yield only a crippled psychology and a

00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:43,830
crippled philosophy so I think it's fair

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,080
to say that Maslow was not a nice man

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,460
especially if we judged them against the

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,540
standards we tend to judge people the

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,669
games today but the the approach that he

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:58,860
had I think is a useful one now here's

00:05:53,669 --> 00:06:00,890
an alternative Aaron Walter man he wrote

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,140
a book called designing for emotion

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:06,960
created this hierarchy of user needs

00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:10,230
this is where it ties in and it finds

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,300
the requirements of an interface to meet

00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:17,790
there must be implemented so you can

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:20,850
attain the you know various levels of of

00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:24,290
user needs so we start with functional

00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:28,350
at the bottom website is not functional

00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:30,990
then you just copied reliable if it's

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,479
not reliable then it can't be usable you

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,520
know every time you try and do something

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,960
on your website or replication it falls

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,570
over it's not usable and

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,980
useable is obviously a good goal but you

00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,020
need to be able to that before to be

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,110
able to have a usable website even if

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,160
it's somewhat difficult to have a

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,410
pleasurable experience of using a

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,580
website and I think sometimes we get as

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,000
far as maybe usable

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,660
don't really think about the the

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,030
pleasurable thing and this is

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:05,100
particularly true of standards and

00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:07,680
guidelines you know applies to lots of

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,230
things like so let's say pretends around

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,020
performance or uptime or security tend

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:15,870
to meet you know the functional and

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:19,410
reliable stages of this you know usable

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:21,540
you know maybe not so you know the

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:26,700
guidelines we have or only getting this

00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:29,430
halfway up this pyramid what I do my day

00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,490
job is sort of based around web content

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:36,180
accessibility guidelines w3c standards

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:39,150
and they're pretty good deciding whether

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,030
something might be functional even

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:45,390
reliable for an accessibility point of

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:49,250
view so we can do things like you know

00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:52,380
test if button on a web page can be

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,120
operated with it with a keyboard we can

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,340
even check that things have an

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,990
appropriate accessible name and exposed

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:02,250
States to screen readers and things like

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:05,220
that and we can check sort of more

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,710
abstract things so there's a success

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,560
criteria called consistent

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,750
identification and that's basically that

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:18,210
you know components are they have the

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:19,080
the same like functionality on different

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,640
page of different parts when

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:27,419
applications are identified consistently

00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:29,100
but with tag like most other standards

00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:31,770
only really gently touches on what it

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,620
means to be usable and you know

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,419
pleasurable is such a variable notion on

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,479
something like the web that it's it's

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,520
really impossible to standardize so it's

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,310
it's these two parts that are usable and

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:48,660
pleasurable that that you know I missed

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:51,900
missed out now pleasurable can mean

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,220
different things depending on what what

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,009
you

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,079
two different situations I'm gonna stick

00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:58,670
to the web and only some of the web but

00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:01,040
it's probably easy to imagine pleasure

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,209
from things we love doing so you know

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,810
the things that you're interested on the

00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:09,069
web but you know an aspect of this also

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,480
applies to things we don't like so maybe

00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:14,120
banking or you know filing tax returns

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,939
or all those sort of things we're not

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,949
really gonna get a sense of joy but we

00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:21,529
can get pleasure in the fact that the

00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:24,079
website helped us to achieve our goal

00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:26,089
then just didn't just know not to

00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,949
prevent us to do you things but actively

00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:30,110
helped us and I think that's worth you

00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:31,459
know the pleasurable part of all of that

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,029
would come in the web so he hasn't

00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:38,209
hindered us it's helped us so I want to

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:40,430
give you a few ideas on the sort of

00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:45,670
things that I think we can do with

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:47,959
JavaScript to perhaps make apps and

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:53,060
sites maybe a little bit more

00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:56,470
pleasurable to use so I'm gonna start

00:09:53,060 --> 00:10:01,279
off with something fairly simple this is

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:04,910
passwords and entering them into forms

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,079
on the web so people in general perhaps

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,600
not the people in this room have

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,009
problems with with passwords I imagine a

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,839
lot of people here using password

00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,839
managers which takes some of the pain

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,350
out of it but the majority people let's

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,870
be honest

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,339
aren't doing that you know they may be

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,559
built into browsers but as soon as you

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:22,910
have more than one computer maybe want

00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,769
to work one at home that becomes more

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,110
difficult and fewer and fewer people are

00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:30,379
going to be making use of these tools

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:33,649
you know we know that it's a good idea

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:36,800
to have unique passwords for for each

00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:39,980
account but as managing passwords

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,029
becomes more difficult for people you

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,259
know that's that's something that it's

00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:44,329
one of the first things they're gonna

00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:46,870
stop doing you know they're not going to

00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:49,990
try and remember this unique passwords

00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,309
and it's not helped when you know the

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,199
dozens of times even with my password

00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:56,720
manager where I've gone in I've typed in

00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:57,680
a nice long 20-plus character string or

00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,509
something like that and it's told me

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,759
well you don't have an uppercase number

00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:04,100
in there so that's not a valid password

00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,870
for us so as soon as these barriers come

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,710
into force people are going to ten

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,240
to fall back on really really simple

00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,320
simple passwords that they can remember

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,190
or stick on a post-it note or whatever

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,900
but there's a there's a furthest

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,960
challenge that I think we can

00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,490
potentially do something about and and

00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,680
that is even if someone has got one

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,230
password that they use everywhere and it

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,830
might be a nice long phrase or you know

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:33,770
something that that you know would meet

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:38,630
the little security barriers to entry

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:40,550
that a lot of websites show it still

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,839
makes them sort of difficult to type in

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,480
because we don't want people to be

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,940
typing a Carrodus

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,279
recent news that's now hackable in about

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,200
two and a half hours some decent

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,850
hardware so you know that that's no good

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,070
we won't want these long things we

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,150
potentially gonna have complicated

00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,810
passwords still because of the

00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:01,100
requirements of websites so if there are

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,930
things we can do to help people type

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,490
their password in that that's a good

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,720
thing I also have this sort of problem

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,270
even though I use a password manager

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,820
I've got a mate who I just go visit him

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,190
and we just watch TV and hang out and I

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,510
have a Netflix account he doesn't so if

00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,520
we want to use a Netflix is here so I

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,779
have to type in the password I've got a

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,480
stupid long password

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,700
you know I've no idea what it is I never

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,400
see it except for when I'm I'm typing

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,680
this in and fortunately Netflix has a

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,480
trick it means you can you can click a

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,130
button and it will switch the password

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,360
field from being regular password field

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,600
to one where I can see the characters in

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,550
it

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,100
so I signed typing it out I can give it

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,150
a check before I hit return and you know

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,740
make sure it's correct and that's

00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,360
basically turned something that would

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,400
take me maybe two or three goes to get

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,339
right into right I can get it get it

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:50,089
done in one go and it's such a simple

00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:52,310
thing so you know basically this is the

00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:53,870
entire code I've missed out some

00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,000
constant let's and all that sort of

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,830
stuff but this is the gist of it like

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,690
sir don't do full-time development more

00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,820
so please don't judge me too harshly on

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,890
anything I show you hopefully on one so

00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:08,360
great here but you know basically I'm

00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:11,150
going to get a check the input which is

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,020
the the password field see what type it

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:17,480
is see if it's already a password decide

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,280
whether it's going to be a password or

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,160
text and then

00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,510
when I click a click a button which is

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,430
next to it I'll demonstrate this is

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,320
going to set the attribute type to

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,510
either text or password as appropriate

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,550
and we're going to do some clever stuff

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:35,330
here this is area pressed we don't

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,290
include some accessibility somewhere so

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,300
area pressed is something that will let

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:43,290
screen readers know that that button is

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:47,190
in an active active state so live demos

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:49,440
whose idea it was this hopefully this is

00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,440
pretty straightforward so you know I can

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,850
type away here really simple I can click

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,270
the show password field and there's my

00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,440
super secure rambling password and it

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,470
really is that easy you know this is

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:06,330
just a fully simple thing that I think

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:09,210
we can do in in a lot of cases and you

00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,470
know will help some people it's going to

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,500
be particularly handy for people who

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,660
lack maybe fine motor control so that

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,070
makes just entering any particular

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,480
content but potentially a difficult task

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,920
but anything where you need to be super

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,020
strict about the characters you know you

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,750
can't correct a typo later with it with

00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,280
it with a password and you know making

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,810
sure you've hit the right keys is a lot

00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,600
easier if you can see what you're typing

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:36,000
than star star star star star something

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,680
you can really only do with JavaScript

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,090
at the moment I imagine this is

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,160
something's going to get built into into

00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,540
into browsers maybe already have since

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:48,000
I've stood thinking about this up but I

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,680
don't think so you know you're not going

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,150
to want to use this on every cases

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,970
you're not going to want to do this for

00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,440
I don't know your employee login for ml

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,710
five or something like that potentially

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,130
but you know for for lots of sites

00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:06,660
something this is this is pretty pretty

00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:10,080
good idea there were a Web Audio API I

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,790
don't know if it many people have used

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,760
these things question hello for banking

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,480
apps which have for example drop-down

00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:22,170
fields to pick the characters from your

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,850
memorable word or whatever it may be do

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,770
they pose a challenge except ility

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,330
challenge so yeah I don't think they

00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,800
pose an accessibility challenge as long

00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,360
as these four fields are labeled

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,820
properly and you know

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,870
good name so that they're understandable

00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,670
usability wise of course that they add

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,709
the add a barrier but it's kind of the

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,240
point they make it more difficult

00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:45,180
whether it's actually something that

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:50,279
works or not I don't I don't know you

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,660
know I know you know people might be

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,829
related to them but you would do that

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,600
sort of thing and then because that's

00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:56,250
difficult they'll write it down in a

00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,380
text file and put it on the desktop you

00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,940
know so I think putting these barriers

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,459
up this is a slightly different subject

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,709
but often makes things less accessible

00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:06,000
you know it leads to people writing

00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:09,990
things on post-it notes and attaching

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,550
them to the monitor whereas you know if

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,800
you can do it sort of two-factor

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,810
authentication over text messages or

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,480
something like that is is gonna be a lot

00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,529
more useful but I do I do have a bank

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,010
account with a bank who does exactly

00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:24,630
that it really annoys me and yeah I

00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,480
don't know if it makes me any safer but

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,010
accessibility wise no I don't think so

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,940
no no not really it's gonna annoy people

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:38,610
but regardless of whether you have

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:41,610
accessibility needs or not okay so this

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:45,860
is a well the demos absolutely stranger

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:48,810
I I wanted oh it's going to think about

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:52,829
demonstrating web notifications but then

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:54,510
I thought it was a bit obvious and also

00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:57,089
I'm doing a presentation where I want to

00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,760
turn off notifications so they don't

00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:02,579
start popping up so that made it sort of

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,230
difficult to do both things so I decided

00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:10,140
to do something similar but with the Web

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:11,819
Audio API so imagine you have you know

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,760
something like Twitter which is pulling

00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:17,850
in new content all the time or you know

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,740
you have a thing that the masthead of

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:23,490
your website which says you have X

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,329
messages or whatever so just to make

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,370
those things a little bit more note

00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,770
noticeable like you would do with

00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,940
something like perhaps slack or Skype or

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,040
something like that you can you can have

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:37,860
things play a little sounder and air-con

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:39,390
an audio icon effectively and you know

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,770
you can basically you know you might

00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,260
want to use these for sort of non urgent

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,300
things like there

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,810
messaged stuff and it's it's really

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:50,900
straightforward now again I'm the demo

00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:53,810
Zod I want you to read out what you see

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,000
on the screen please and shouted out

00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:59,300
Leonie will appreciate thee what are you

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,820
description I don't know what inspired

00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:07,430
me to to do this or to wear this t-shirt

00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:09,890
I can't really tell but here goes

00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:13,090
hopefully the sound will work we tested

00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,090
it before but we haven't tested it since

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,790
you know I'm an accessibility specialist

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,790
I know how to use a keyboard right

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:45,890
believe me it's beeping right anyone

00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,770
know this is the litany against fear

00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:52,730
from the probably the greatest work of

00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:56,240
science fiction ever created June not

00:18:52,730 --> 00:19:00,190
the David Lynch one what you'd like that

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,920
as well so yeah so I mean that's that's

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:06,050
remarkably silly but I'm not really

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:11,560
going to go into lots of details about

00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:16,040
how it works I will show you some code

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:21,590
but you know it's relatively relatively

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:24,470
straightforward I think I hope and you

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,270
know see you again it seemed a little

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,500
constant let's down here not not that

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,840
bad a JavaScript developer these days

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,000
but you set up a context it's an audio

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,920
context then you create an oscillator

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,400
which is basically describing a sound in

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:41,720
this case it's a triangular triangular

00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:44,000
wave set of frequency and connect the

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,280
two things up connect the oscillator to

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,840
thee to the context start playing it

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,240
that's it and then tell me when to stop

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,660
so just for really simple sounds it's

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,789
like that it's it's not too difficult to

00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,610
do it I don't think

00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:59,919
wanting to go with this stuff and a lot

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,600
of the other things I might show you

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,159
some of them not everyone is gonna want

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,149
their browsers to stop beeping at them

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,529
and they don't really want to turn off

00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:07,610
sound for every tab individually that's

00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:08,779
the most annoying thing the world so

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,399
perhaps if you're gonna do something

00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:12,019
like this have it off by default and

00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:15,440
have a setting that people can turn on

00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:18,559
if they want it but it's you know it's

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,740
again it's just just a little thing

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,970
we're not talking huge amounts of code

00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,710
you know this is the you know I wrote

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,720
more code to get the stuff to display on

00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:29,210
the screen at intervals than and I did

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,610
to actually set up the making a beeping

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,110
noise and I'm not a sound engineer so

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:38,000
you can do better than just a low

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:40,639
frequency you know noise but it just

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,529
turns something boring just add

00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,909
something that might make using a

00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:45,470
website a little bit more interesting a

00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:50,720
bit more pleasurable compared to

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:53,200
everyone else's okay so more web web

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,049
audio type things web speech API and

00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:00,380
speech synthesis I think this is this is

00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:02,570
a bit cooler I had this idea and it's

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:07,929
it's probably you know not a brilliant

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:11,500
idea but you could use web speech

00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:15,080
synthesis to add audio descriptions to

00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,919
video and I really just wanted to see if

00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,799
it's feasible

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,440
not necessarily recommend it but you

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:24,620
know just for yourself if you don't know

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,049
audio description is the the audio

00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,330
content that goes along with the regular

00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:31,669
audio track of of a piece of video

00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:34,940
content and it describes what's

00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:39,049
happening on the screen for anyone that

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:41,299
can't see it so you wouldn't describe

00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:43,250
everything but if let's say you had a

00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:45,409
fight scene going on you'd want to know

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,909
who was being punched by who who had

00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:48,919
someone in a headlock that sort of thing

00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:50,389
and it'd be very difficult to pick that

00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:55,059
up just on based on what you're gonna

00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:57,200
what you're hearing in the audio so

00:21:55,059 --> 00:22:01,190
audio description gives you that other

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,600
part of the picture this is the second

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,929
Netflix of reference of the night I

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,269
don't work for them or anything but

00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:09,770
they're kind of useful in this context

00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:13,820
they got into a little bit of

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:18,560
when they released daredevil because

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:21,770
they released a show about a blind

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,470
person that wasn't accessible to blind

00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,430
people because it didn't have audience

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,970
description

00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,650
when I first launched now of course that

00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,630
wouldn't actually bother the dirt but he

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,280
can probably sense the pixels activated

00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,690
on the screen through vibrations or

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,790
something because he's the worst

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:42,050
representation of a blind person I've

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:44,720
ever really because he can do everything

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,540
without be able to see so it doesn't

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,300
really really affect him at all does it

00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:52,730
it's only a benefit so that was going on

00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:55,640
there but anyway it's a good show come

00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,380
watch it it's really but for everyone

00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,480
else you know there's a problem now to

00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,850
their credit Netflix pretty quickly when

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,650
and corrected this problem and since

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,270
then they've actually done a reasonable

00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:08,900
job I think of providing audio

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:11,030
descriptions for for for their shows but

00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,920
you know still got a bit of that

00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:17,150
developer itch so I thought well let's

00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:19,910
see what we can do here I'm gonna show

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:22,280
the demo see I was reminded this this is

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:26,180
probably a video you've seen before it's

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,860
a dog called Fenton running running away

00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,250
no it's the audio matters here let's

00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,250
hope this works

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:43,490
distance and I not screen the rings - ah

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,049
so now I should say that writing audio

00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,940
description content is an art form in

00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,320
and of itself because I cheated a bit

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,090
there I pause the video at one point

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,259
because I couldn't fit it in but when

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,029
you're doing like broadcast television

00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:36,679
that's not what you get to do you just

00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:38,360
get given content and you have to fit in

00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,960
whatever you need in the gaps in the

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,980
dialog and it's yeah people that do that

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,619
you know fantastic they have to be

00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,309
really good at their job to make it

00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:50,720
seamlessly so I just couple this

00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:53,360
together so now again you probably don't

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,309
want to do this but let's be honest we

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,440
all get given content and designs and

00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:59,119
things like that but just you know don't

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,210
really work and it's left to the

00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,039
developers writing JavaScript to hackers

00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,409
as best they can to make it to make it

00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,460
work so I guess very very worst case now

00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:09,769
you might do something like that but is

00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:14,090
a cool demonstration of it speech

00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:17,179
synthesis synthesis API I think that

00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:23,240
person talking was Daniel who's the name

00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:27,080
of the of the speech so but there are

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,190
there are many others and you can

00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,259
actually find out what you've got under

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,309
stalled with a single line of code I'm

00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:34,190
not sure I actually included on the

00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:37,190
slide but if you're interested I can

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:42,519
show you that later let's see I can go

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:45,799
back to my slides but again actually

00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:50,119
might be you know sort of simpler than

00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:52,879
you might think so I'm getting at the

00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:56,389
reference to the speech synthesis API I

00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:59,360
create an utterance so a new speech

00:25:56,389 --> 00:26:02,270
synthesis utterance or you know whatever

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,570
text you want and then I just say

00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:07,190
since top speak and it will read it out

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,140
so the settings you've got for that I've

00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,660
chosen choosing the voice choosing the

00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,360
pitch choosing the speech rate all that

00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:16,400
sort of stuff but if you just did this

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,980
this this will work on its own all that

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,260
all the rest of it is defaults you don't

00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,910
need and then I've just tied it to the

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,390
video with an event listener on the the

00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:29,780
time update which is I don't know what

00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:32,059
they Hertz it it runs out but it depends

00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,200
on your system but it's you know it put

00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:35,090
three of a second you probably gonna get

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,530
that sort of sort of accuracy I think

00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,390
from there and that just updates every

00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:41,440
time basically every time in the video

00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:44,600
play the time stamp updates for for it

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,309
and so you know effectively in this

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,260
event listener on doing this setting up

00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,570
all this stuff and speaking out really

00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,580
really fairly yeah fairly

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,190
straightforward again alright more code

00:26:52,580 --> 00:27:00,760
to get it to figure out the video bit

00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:00,760
than it did to do the speech bit don't

00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:06,700
have a think about if you can think of

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:13,309
anything that where that might be useful

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:15,260
give it a try okay now so we got beeping

00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:16,640
we got reading out content but that's

00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,650
not really enough to make a new best

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,280
friend out of we actually need someone

00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:26,090
to listen to us and you know it's 2019 I

00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:28,610
believe and we're still typing into our

00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,870
computers and every sci-fi show well

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:33,320
maybe not do initially every sci-fi

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:38,170
thing you know promise me that I'd be

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:41,480
talking into my computer and without

00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:42,860
some extra software which I do use I'm

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,320
not really doing this as part the web

00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,820
browser and there's there's there's

00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,850
quite a lot of scope I think for this

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,250
but one of the most obvious I think is

00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:53,360
something that you see sometimes in a

00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:59,990
native mobile applications very little

00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:00,620
on the web but again we have a demo hope

00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,900
this works

00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,940
right this is you may know sir I'm

00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,920
running my things on fire wats Firefox

00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:10,550
because you think open we're supporting

00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:14,030
now all that stuff but it's only works

00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,909
in Chrome not even you know nightly or

00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:19,519
anything like that

00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:21,419
in Chrome but you know one day so great

00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,549
you look to see the difference there I

00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,899
still create a page but you know but to

00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:30,619
progressive enhancement opponents notion

00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:35,279
that easy right so a couple of things

00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:37,049
this does require a web connection so

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,639
I'm relying on that I'm on the Wi-Fi so

00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:43,940
that's that's good so we should be all

00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:48,899
right it does send this to Google HQ so

00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:50,759
you know make about what you will but

00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:52,139
you know people are bringing listen to

00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:57,840
Weston to the house I've done it myself

00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:58,889
and you know so again I'm not sure

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,690
what's gonna happen here I might get

00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:03,419
Scott to get inundated by whatever I

00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,220
type in here but oh I'm saying there but

00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:11,220
I think anyone's got a suggestion for me

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:13,379
to search for a question yeah so it's

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,450
it's yeah it's the rosary PO I just you

00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:19,769
know browser is basically passing is on

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:21,779
yeah passing on to and then and then

00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:26,489
return results I'll show you the snippet

00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:27,570
of the API but anything any suggestions

00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:29,190
for I'll ask you to say the API is

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,340
really as the the recognition is pretty

00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:34,649
good so we can say whatever you want

00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,899
what it's going to say something said

00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:47,369
keep it clean

00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:50,159
anyone who don't need to go for it okay

00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:51,119
all right let's hope this works gonna be

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:58,529
messing around with the audio on this

00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:59,789
and made it work again so you'll see the

00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:05,849
button go blue and that's what I'm gonna

00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:07,109
talk best um yes also I did this is

00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:10,289
deliberate I just forgot that I'd done

00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:11,159
this right because it uses them using

00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:12,090
your microphone it's going to ask for

00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:20,309
permissions and things like that so

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:22,970
that's a good thing so right best June

00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:22,970
novel

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:34,750
so you can capitalize it look at that

00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:37,780
that's brilliant what is the best

00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,010
auditory folks well yeah don't don't

00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,980
read the stuff that was written by his

00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:45,570
son and just read the rest that's the

00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:54,670
best answer so yeah again this is

00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:57,790
perhaps so simpler than then then then

00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:59,410
you might think you know it's amazing

00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:03,190
people designed these api's thought

00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:05,620
about usability and stuff so I grabbed a

00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,600
web kit speech recognition

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,690
hopefully it's simple we can drop drop

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,540
the WebKit bless what's required here we

00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:16,150
have an event listener on the on what

00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,350
that returns for the result and then we

00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:24,040
do something with the result which is

00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:25,690
this weirdly complex nested array or

00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,250
object or something but you know that's

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:31,780
what you get back you can also do things

00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:33,160
like request multiple results so it's

00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:36,490
not sure what it's saying it can you can

00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,650
say well return me a maximum of five

00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,480
possible options and things like that so

00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,280
if you're if you want people to you know

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,860
set it up so you speak into it you

00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,890
choose something you can do that and

00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,150
then you get an end event which is you

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:53,410
know really handy just to make sure that

00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:57,670
they've stopped listening so you know

00:31:53,410 --> 00:32:01,540
again I'm doing things like making the

00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:03,010
button blue and add some area States to

00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,960
it so you know you know it's active and

00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,520
or not and that's the bit when I don't

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,470
do it do it and there's this literally

00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:14,080
recognition dot stop call that and yeah

00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:16,150
you have you have speech recognition

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,980
built into interpreters I think there's

00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:24,220
pretty brainy and you know throat that

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,260
there's really no good reason not to

00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:30,060
sort of include it in things like sent

00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,060
simple search forms question

00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:41,999
regardless like different regional

00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:44,759
accents yeah oh it does Alexei is pretty

00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:46,049
good with my accent but I'm from the

00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:49,019
northwest of England so I tried it with

00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:51,210
a Scouse accent oh it's pretty good it

00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:53,309
wasn't too bad actually I mean you you

00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:56,789
can set the language that it expects to

00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:58,469
- here it defaults to whatever the

00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:01,289
language of the page is set with the

00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:03,149
language view which is handy that's the

00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:05,879
default but you know if you want to you

00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:08,070
can you can set it to different

00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:11,190
languages I don't know how what Google

00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:14,729
is supporting it their end but I found

00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:17,039
it pretty good you know feel free to try

00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:19,499
it later and I think your voice is gonna

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,849
be fine seems alright anyone with a

00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:23,460
strong regional accent wants to give it

00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:31,769
a go then I'm strong regional accents in

00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:32,700
Bristol is understandable yeah give it a

00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:34,889
go

00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,320
look sir I think this is just it's super

00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:38,729
simple to it add to you know any website

00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,039
we've got search in the top right hand

00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:42,869
corner put that in you know let's forget

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,159
with this there's typing nonsense and

00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:46,019
make people look stupid when the surgeon

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,460
for things in public but it's an

00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,499
enhancement you know it just makes

00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,969
things a little bit nicer perhaps

00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:52,499
pleasurable you don't have to use it and

00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:54,289
just type in if you want but it but it's

00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:57,029
there

00:33:54,289 --> 00:34:01,080
okay so that's that's it I just wanted

00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:03,719
to show you a few ideas and try and

00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,539
inspire you to think about well what can

00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:10,349
I do that little bit extra to make my

00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:15,210
site go from functional and usable to to

00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:16,859
pleasurable to use and if I got time for

00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:19,139
questions yes

00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:22,220
so that the question is have I tried to

00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:28,369
use it for some focusing on different

00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:32,549
things and navigating pages so no and

00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:36,029
sort of yes in that I have used that I

00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:39,629
have a little bit of RSI through being

00:34:36,029 --> 00:34:41,639
typing fatigue too long and you know not

00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:43,619
looking after my way hands the way I

00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,110
should so sometimes I use a piece of

00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:49,560
software called Dragon NaturallySpeaking

00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:52,200
which basically does that so it's it's a

00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,000
it's a full speech interface I can

00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,130
command my entire desktop with it in

00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,810
theory browse the web whatever I need to

00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:03,030
do now the the the thing about that is

00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:05,430
if people need that I'm saying need

00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:07,740
rather than would like then they're

00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:10,580
going to use a dedicated tool like

00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:13,920
Dragon it's also something built into

00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:18,210
Mac OS I'm not sure about Windows yeah

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,850
that's right so and you know varying

00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,080
degrees of quality and accuracy but if

00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:24,180
people need them they're going to use

00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,830
their own thing it's like what screen

00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:30,330
readers another example sometimes you'll

00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:32,850
see little controls on on pages to you

00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,960
know read out the site and I think you

00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:36,420
know some people think maybe that

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,970
they're doing this because well that'll

00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:42,030
make blind people that you know be able

00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,320
to use the website but how did they get

00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,640
to your website in the first place if

00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,660
they don't already have something to do

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,340
that right

00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:52,440
same with same to some extent with you

00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,390
know the controls for increasing the

00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,850
text size one it's built in the browser

00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,680
and two if someone needs that they need

00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:02,730
a lot every site they visit pretty much

00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,460
so your site in special there's someone

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,210
to go unless you ridiculously small text

00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:11,040
in the first place

00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:12,750
so I think you could the problem with

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,850
things like that is that you need to

00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,590
know what people are going to say so you

00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,470
you know you get return these strings

00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:21,660
but do people know that they should say

00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,340
click instead of press to activate a

00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,290
button you know so you get into those

00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,960
those sort of problems so I would

00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:30,570
suggest that yes you could but is

00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,250
probably not worth the effort but you

00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,830
could do conversational interfaces like

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,260
you know really annoying banking help

00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,760
test things I won't really like those on

00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,650
phone calls though because I never get

00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,060
where I want to but you could have it as

00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,820
an option because some people just don't

00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:47,340
like talking to human beings and they're

00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:51,250
a benefit to them so yeah

00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:54,760
yes in your example

00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,860
and listeners on the API that you

00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:06,040
mention about how for instance on the

00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:09,460
end event there any mechanisms within

00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,020
the browsers that are more native and

00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,790
not part of the document in terms of

00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:22,420
subscribing to events so never never

00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:24,210
will you use Darian and I'll take it and

00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:27,730
take a chance on this and show you my

00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:35,200
actual code again don't judge me

00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:37,060
so but so what I'm doing is is really

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,580
just this so when you click on the

00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,700
button it just sets this area pressed

00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,070
attributes

00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,720
I didn't so is there something more

00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:47,290
native to these sort of things well I

00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,480
mean the the that the purpose of this is

00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:51,330
were responding to things so I'm

00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,050
literally all I'm doing is using that to

00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,980
notify the use of the something's

00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:56,860
happened so they've clicked on the

00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,780
button and you know it's not immediately

00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:01,390
obvious that what's going on really so

00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,370
I'm setting it to instead of black on a

00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:06,880
white background I'm saying it's a white

00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:08,500
text on a blue background and because

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,240
that's a visual thing which would mean

00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,280
nothing to one person using a screen

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,670
reader I'm doing the the equivalent

00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,020
which is Aria dash pressed which

00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,820
basically says there's button is cannot

00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,260
be pressed and then on the event you can

00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,350
see I'm doing really lazy trycatch is

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:26,920
exactly the wrong thing just the reason

00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:28,570
for that is it's a lot easier than than

00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,110
doing something like this recognition

00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:35,830
and then if that you know so anyways

00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:37,810
been lazy but you know I think there's

00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,090
any sort of way to really respond other

00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:43,930
than then using event listens does

00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:46,570
something like this API I mean you know

00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:50,980
it's it's it's not Dom it it is

00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:53,800
JavaScript so yeah this is the only

00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:58,390
thing you do so yeah you know I really

00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:02,350
for these rich internet directive

00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:04,090
applications so you know it's entirely

00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,010
appropriate to be using error in this

00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,330
way is what it's

00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:11,980
it's designed for thank you very much

00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:11,980
