Title: Vue.JS In Action - Bristol JS - March 2019
Publication date: 2019-04-01
Playlist: Bristol JS
Description: 
	Presented by Simone Cuomo.

The JavaScript ecosystem has been ever-changing for over a decade, meaning front-end developers have had to stay busy to keep track of new technologies. After tirelessly experimenting with different JavaScript frameworks and libraries for over five years, I have now found the one that works for me: Vue.js. In this tutorial, I will share essential resources and explain the basic structure of a Vue app.

This session will cover: * Project Setup * Definition of components * Mixins * Unit test

Resources used: * Vue CLI * Codesandbox * JEST * SCSS * Advanced Javascript

The goal of this session is to give the audience a good understanding of the framework, that will enable them to kick-start their own Vue project.

hi guys so I'm following up after George

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,639
I was a lovely lovely talk and I was

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,900
based on graph QL and react what I'm

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,620
going to go we're going to discuss today

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,000
is the competitors do Jess so it's nice

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,590
that he was interested there was an

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,640
introduction components you've seen some

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,690
of the code there will be nice to

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,730
actually see the differences in the

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,949
codes and actually the end results can

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,840
actually be similar so it gives you the

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:31,710
ability to actually make your own choice

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:35,940
and go and view oh yeah

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,280
that's which is on so before we start

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,230
introduced myself so my name is Simona

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,629
and I'm a technical database solution so

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,910
actually work in Swansea but we do have

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,550
offices in Bristol and everywhere in UK

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,920
and also overseas you can find me with

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,920
delegated 0 everywhere at the website

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,930
email Twitter and I'll please feel free

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,030
to contact me and if you want any more

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,280
information if you want the resources if

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,750
you want suggestions anything you want

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,799
just contact me even if it's for the

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:08,909
pizza or Italian stuff in fact so I am a

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,369
dad that's full time I am a basketball

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,939
referee I'm a conference speaker I'm a

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,509
blog

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:20,009
bottom really aim nowadays is a lot of

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:22,200
you Jess so I am a mostly with my work

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,420
I do most of the full stack developer in

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,100
my current position I'm moving towards a

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,840
senior JavaScript position with a

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,409
Silicon Valley startup in the next

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,060
couple of months

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:35,220
and that will be sure just on JavaScript

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,810
react angular and view but I need to be

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,280
honest and say that I'd really like the

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,860
view by even if I'm happy to see them

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,920
you know I'm like to see every sides of

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,040
the of the ecosystem and try to work

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,960
around with it but view really struck me

00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,490
so what we're going to do today I'm

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,500
gonna do what George trying not to do

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,119
and he's jumped between PowerPoint and

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,579
code so it's going to go terribly wrong

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,649
I'm gonna type it's going to go terribly

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,469
wrong as well but it's gonna be fine so

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,659
we're going to touch a little bit on

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,040
what is new jazz just little

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,320
introduction components at least you

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,910
could do jazz components then I give I'm

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,020
gonna give you loads of resources to get

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,239
started if you've never done it before

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,140
so lots of different things that will

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,240
actually support

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,890
get to start very quickly and they were

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,770
going to build a very small application

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,420
trying to use components we try to use

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,040
mix-ins I try to show you what the

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,700
difference is the properties lifecycle

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,400
and so on so forth

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,050
stories there is loads to cover and I'm

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:37,790
you know hopefully we can cover

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:40,620
everything so the JavaScript has been

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,870
crazy for the last 10 years you know we

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,540
all know NPM came on board fantastic

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,610
easy to install new packages but what

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,260
that really meant is everyone was just

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,060
creating their own you know my Jesse

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,400
Mona Jesse monochrome Oh Jess

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,940
delegated leader Jess so it was it was a

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,860
bit of a crazy decade okay what happened

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,769
in the last few years anything from 2014

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,620
2013 onwards is that big companies such

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,810
as the you know a big big names such as

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,470
react and angular started to came into

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,269
the ecosystem and they started to I

00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,709
wouldn't say slowed down the you know

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,120
the speed in which JavaScript is

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,930
changing but what they did they actually

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,730
started to make a little bit of oh they

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,329
started to put order in the very

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,610
fast-moving ecosystem view was actually

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,260
created in the same areas as react the

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,970
only difference is that it took a little

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,530
bit longer to start because it didn't

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,790
have a multi-million company pushing it

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,360
beyond the scene so it was more about

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,680
people starting to to use it do you know

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,239
they were going to conference I went to

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,850
conference last time I went to go to add

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,739
to go to London not paid forward to pay

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,870
for the travel for everything and the

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,660
guy next door to me was paid journey

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,430
from Las Vegas from Los Angeles a week

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,970
paid to see London it was a quite

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,620
different so a question that I forgot to

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,079
ask in the previous slide is how many of

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:02,040
you guys have actually used anything

00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:05,180
such as view react or angular how many

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,440
of you have actually used vue.js

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:12,090
how many of you have actually used you

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:14,280
jes all the way to production I know the

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,640
hands go down don't be scared guys is

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,560
fine so for some of you that actually

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,970
abused you just before awfully we still

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,220
are still gonna give some resources that

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,460
can be useful and I'm also trying to

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,860
give you some feedback on

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,000
you know way of creating components and

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,009
something that we went through in our

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,569
life cycling work that actually you know

00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,270
we learn from our mistakes hopefully if

00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:38,940
you can if I can about you doing the

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:42,509
same mistakes that will be fantastic so

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,919
as I say these three these three main

00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:46,680
competitors came on board and they're

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,150
really pushing for for the style for the

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,819
JavaScript framework to be standardized

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,800
so what happen is that vue.js decided

00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:54,750
this is the way you derive route routing

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,819
and it just pushes something react will

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,680
do the same and this is the way you do

00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,300
static website with react.js and then

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,949
there is one is a very similar one for

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,680
vue.js so they're starting to just say

00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:07,199
instead in just a 15 20 different ways

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,180
of using things they just pushing for

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,800
one and one only end up pushing the

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,599
whole open-source community to support

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,669
the one specific one specific feature or

00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:19,949
package for example in view JS in

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:23,970
react.js we got react native for native

00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:28,590
API a native application for vue.js we

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:31,770
have native script so again very similar

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:34,979
they all got the same same aim that is

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,750
trying to provide a 1:1 stop to actually

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,220
create application with this love with

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,099
these frameworks and what they're really

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,110
trying to do is make it very simple for

00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:46,050
you guys to use native script from

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,370
starting view application and and

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,110
they're working and they're doing it

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,400
really well because loads as you can see

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,810
from the hands up loads of people are

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,030
getting into this framework and there's

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,710
no you know there is me and the reason

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,680
is actually the fact that they're making

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,690
things simpler see simple to actually

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,159
search for it simple to actually go

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,050
through and make your own decision well

00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:08,789
there's less decision to make that is a

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:11,009
good things so first question will be

00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:13,229
why would you ever want to views views

00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,630
view so you go around and react react

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,159
react and react is the word you use and

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,229
react as a cool sticker to go on your

00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:21,960
computer and everything else but what do

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:24,110
I use you so first thing is not backed

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,509
by a multi-million company there for me

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,580
it means that actually for for you to be

00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:30,960
successful as it is without someone

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,070
actually paying thousands and thousands

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,010
of pound to send people to all

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:37,349
conferences is a big big achievement so

00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,510
that's really important things for me is

00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:41,910
is getting a Barry

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,730
is very quickly getting mark in gaining

00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,440
market marker share you will see there's

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,200
a slight next where you shows the get up

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,670
stars from last year is not that react

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,080
level yet so we're talking about

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,060
probably less than a million people

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,740
actually you know of activities when

00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,450
react is probably over the 10 million so

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,210
you know we're not at that level yet but

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:04,230
the speeding which is gaining try again

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,610
gaining momentum now is really

00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,800
increasing I think it's direct time to

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,770
live then there's a lower learning curve

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,170
so we invite in the solution we started

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,940
to employ lots of graduates so what we

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:18,450
did because we couldn't choose effuse we

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,010
do react we decided that one department

00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,140
was using view and one department which

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:25,260
isn't react I know that was the great

00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,390
choice so what we did then just to make

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,640
things are there we employed employed

00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,050
graduates from University and half of

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,720
them went to the react team and after

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,520
them went to do it on the mutant so

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,530
there was a little bit of fighting they

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,050
still fighting and they will be fighting

00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,190
forever but what I really learned from

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,510
it because it wasn't the top of the

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,810
cheese I was able to see the progress

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:48,240
and what was going on the guys that

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,070
start with you they were when you were

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,330
showing them the you know the first

00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,620
interaction when they were showing them

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,590
would yours do what they were supposed

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,360
to actually achieve they were excited

00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,560
they were ready to jump on board because

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,420
at the end of the day used normal

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,910
functionality was HTML Javascript and

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:05,520
CSS they were able to see something they

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,980
recognized then we did the same perfect

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,510
exercise with react to say okay this is

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,220
very simple let's start from the bottom

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,690
and they were going okay okay well

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,250
that's loads of JavaScript I never seen

00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,110
all this JavaScript don't worry it's all

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,940
going to be HTML so you're gonna be fine

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,740
they do everything great HTML know it's

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,230
coming this Jess Jess X so that's no

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,880
HTML so it was there's a little bit more

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,560
of a learning curve I know that most of

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,300
you are senior developers so you can go

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,100
and react everyone love JavaScript and

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,620
it's simple if you are a senior

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,750
developer for for for the guy coming out

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,760
from university I can guarantee you the

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,860
view Jess is going to be you know it is

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,270
really supporting in our in our place

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,380
you know I can guarantee you that the

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,990
guys that are doing view are already in

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,790
the team there FP they've not had done

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,190
many difficulties to actually gain

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,230
control and they're they're more

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,240
proficient proficient is actually

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,500
creating components advanced components

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,570
and actually play with

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,060
when the guy would react they took a bit

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,680
longer they both achieved the same but I

00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,970
know that the effort that took from me

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,720
to actually made them achieve the same

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:06,000
was a bit different and then is easy to

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,650
implement in an existing project so we

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,180
have a solution where one of the main

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,580
application is the old

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:15,120
so it's from 2007 we still got jQuery

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,370
1.6 so it's an old app it doesn't have

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,410
any of these fancy of reloading you know

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,510
yes the experiencer part of it does okay

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,600
so it's not that bad but we want you to

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,100
implement reacting it and it was a bit

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,840
complicated because yes reacts is

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,520
fantastic but you cannot just take react

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,990
and add it on a page and have one single

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,520
banner done we react because then you

00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,500
can't really play with the Dom and it

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,810
was harder yes there are way to do it

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,980
but not what it's supposed to do so as

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,120
soon as you go and search it there is

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,710
always a big ban and say you're not

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,930
supposed to do this this is the solution

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,600
so we thought okay let's not do react

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,730
let's try with view we took view we took

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,920
the view view view file in our

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,780
application we create the header and the

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,370
footer nothing special so just add an

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,620
footer we didn't even do compilation or

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,390
nothing and he worked from there and

00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,830
then we started to build up to start to

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,640
have NPM package to actually have

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,860
components exposed and we created our

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,720
own NPM package with components and we

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,370
build on top of that so it was simpler

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,260
for us to take it put it in a real

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,150
application and then build on top of it

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,730
so this is one of the reason why

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,910
probably American with view but may not

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,230
apply in your specific way so this is

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,530
one of the slides I wanted to show so

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,870
this is what so I actually came from I

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,400
think on the slide show that was at the

00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:30,240
beginning the state of JavaScript this

00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,110
is one of the one of the statistics that

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,910
came out from it

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:38,310
so as you can see there is a big big gap

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,440
between react and view in number of

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,180
stars on the year this is the only stats

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,190
which view is actually on top because

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,060
you see all that starts that the gap is

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:50,520
very big so an Amana Sun say that is not

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,780
overtaking react yet but this is a sign

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,150
and say that this is starting to go

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:58,310
faster so give it a couple of years

00:10:54,150 --> 00:11:00,690
awfully not more than ten or catch-up um

00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:03,350
what do you need with RIA with view to

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,890
get started as I mentioned before HTML

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,910
Javascript and CSS

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,430
so I'm going to show you a very basic

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:12,850
component it let nothing different than

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:14,320
a an empty export and HTML there's

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,200
nothing different in there so you can

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,810
really start from something basic and

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,250
then build on top of that so if we go

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,959
back to the Graduate so we go back to

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:26,320
someone who wants to do it on spare time

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:30,610
so I started as a as a developer I was a

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,110
chef I have my own my own cafe and a

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,820
friend came over and asked me to do a

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,279
website and I started to learn by myself

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,050
new and react was not there so I started

00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,459
to learn with WordPress and you think oh

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,760
it's great let me do some change in

00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:46,930
templates you know and everything just

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,640
goes on top so we with this I can see

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,050
that there will be more of a trend of

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,730
people started to make their own small

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,380
website the same thing with caps be is

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,579
you know the solution the possibility

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,440
for people that don't have enough

00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,940
knowledge and don't have someone to

00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,829
train them to actually get something

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,329
started so hopefully we will ever try

00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:03,250
and the more people joining because I

00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:05,560
don't know in Bristol bar in Swansea the

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,360
demand is huge and the the supply of

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,220
developers and so and so forth is very

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,420
very low so we need more and this is a

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,640
good thing

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,920
you need to have no Jack's installed

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,649
that's probably the only thing you have

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,420
to do and it's very simple to follow for

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:21,519
example of Harlow tutorials so I was

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,829
told it you have to have an idea of your

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,660
choice so for the idea of your choice

00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:27,850
actually I am using Visual Studio code

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,920
but what I'm actually doing recently is

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,829
using doing everything I can initially

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,430
on code sandbox has any of you actually

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:37,060
heard of course on box before so is the

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,550
guy behind

00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,250
I met the guy DNS in the actual creator

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,440
within gujja in vue.js London I didn't

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,149
know was actually him the guy's mad this

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,670
you know it takes it is everything with

00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:51,730
West Ham assembly so now a Visual Studio

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,870
code instance is actually loads in your

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,220
browser and I'm gonna show you so you

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,769
feel never seen it before I'm gonna show

00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,260
you how the code sandbox starts you can

00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:00,610
go on it if you want a Gatsby a view or

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,100
everything you search for it you click

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,019
on it you click fork you can start from

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,760
it and if you like the project you just

00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:08,260
click github and it creates a github

00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,570
then you can pull and do npm install

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,800
done so it's a good way again for

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,839
someone that doesn't know what it's

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,760
doing to get started get a few pages

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,829
getting interested in it and pull it

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,320
over or for senior developer is a good

00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:21,730
way to do 12 an idea

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,530
they're got native script they call

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,420
these kind of things already build up so

00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,890
you go on it you can never feel try an

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,200
error and if something really is worth

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,720
your effort and time you put it down and

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,280
you get it locally and then as I say

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,590
basically knowledge you get by it's not

00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,720
really necessary initially I'm gonna

00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:40,720
share loads of resources but I'm gonna

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,250
send the PowerPoint over later so if if

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,590
you guys if you guys would if you guys

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,180
want any resources or the code I'm gonna

00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,630
I'm gonna share everything later on so

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:52,620
you can actually get down there to Bay

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:56,350
two main pages of how to get started

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,500
another good point of view documentation

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:02,140
is fantastic you go in the actual view

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,030
J's documentation has been created by

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,740
guys has been created by the guys that

00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,750
really cared about view it's been

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,960
updated by them and you just go there is

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:13,210
the one point of actually knowledge so

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,890
it's very important where you know where

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,390
to go directly they when you have to go

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,760
in google and search for Stack Overflow

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,050
and you know and trying to find the

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,700
solution of what is the right way of

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,710
doing it they'll tell you what this

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,180
right way is written very simply and you

00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,310
can follow it and that's very very

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,820
important for a framework there's a

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:32,290
podcast you Jess is done by the I think

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,480
there is a there are two schools for

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,750
view one is view mastery and that one is

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,510
I don't view school I think your school

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:43,060
and you mastery these the this podcast

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,820
is run by the guy from view mastery and

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:50,080
then there is a link for the can say

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:52,390
this word guys in sorry got it comes out

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,850
really bad so you can just follow this

00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:57,790
link is fantastic and is a couple of

00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:00,370
pages okay and he actually gives you you

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,450
know it's very it's very it will support

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,970
you a lot if you're actually getting

00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:06,160
start with you native script as a

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:10,000
mansion is an open source to build

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,010
native apps very similar to very similar

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,750
to react native he allows you to use all

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,150
your knowledge you have of your album of

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,590
you J's and an older functionality an

00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,050
old existing component the only thing

00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,060
you have to change is the mark-up is

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,800
that then be plain HTML is a little bit

00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,130
different so yeah it kind of looked like

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,510
a like an XML so you have to pass on

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,640
properties better than that is really

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:33,300
they're doing the fantastic job nothing

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,550
to say on native script is that

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,110
they go a online playground so you can

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,760
actually go and start the project very

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,890
similar to code sandbox because they

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,410
know each other and help each other and

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,060
so it's very good for you to get started

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,870
without web twist all emulate or

00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:52,170
anything else as I mention before code

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,820
sandbox and then storybook I don't know

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,370
that is storybook is actually the react

00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,990
up and then someone created an adapter

00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,240
of view on top of it so if you had a do

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:03,240
react of view i really suggest you to go

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,950
storybook idea be heard of it i've

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,660
actually used that in production and

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:12,209
that was that what really you know if

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,220
you want to do something seriously these

00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:16,500
really did it for us so we created our

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,029
own plugins now so we do the component

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,740
we go accessibility in the component we

00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,480
go end-to-end testing into component the

00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,370
components get created in images that

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,149
our BS can use when they have to do user

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,100
stories has gone from a sim simple place

00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:30,660
where we're actually able to develop a

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,190
component to something huge

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,779
i'm not able to show you the story book

00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:37,770
because I pulled it by it's fantastic

00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:39,779
and the dev tools so I'm gonna show you

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,700
the dev tools for Chrome and Firefox and

00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:45,240
what is actually able to do I know that

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,649
react is catching up on them so if you

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,490
don't wit there's a little bit of a

00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:52,770
funny trait threads between the guy that

00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,870
created these and some guys from react

00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,040
because you know they they joking with

00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,480
each other one of the guys said oh

00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,829
you're catching up guys well done I'll

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,140
send you the code if you want and

00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:03,060
everything stuff that but it's you know

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,800
the both of them I know that again

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:09,510
they're gonna support development and to

00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:12,660
and that's what really matters to us you

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,850
Jess what you also as you know that

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,380
everyone has you know starts view and

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,150
p.m. starts view and everything else you

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,880
know all this big ol these big

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:23,550
frameworks is something to start but

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,780
view Jess says in the last big updates

00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:29,820
they created the 3.0 CL eyes I was at a

00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,830
couple of project with the old with all

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,240
comment in the comment line interface it

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,320
was okay and I thought oh let me give a

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,590
try food with a new one

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,570
a is fantastic so what you're able to do

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,780
with this is something different from

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,610
any previously created you know start up

00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,620
if you don't say so you're able to

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,100
create your project and has you create

00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,520
it you

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,320
a long list of actually long list of

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,820
feature that you can actually apply so

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,800
you're able to say at the beginning if

00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,440
you want to use typescript if you want

00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,700
to use Pug if you use what kind of

00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,200
preprocessor if you want to use

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,000
end-to-end testing so you can actually

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,070
start everything select everything at

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,230
the start but the good thing of it is

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,090
that you can actually add things as you

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,950
go along so you start the project with

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,660
nothing and as you go through you say oh

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,550
now I want to do unit testing so you go

00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,800
there you did you add the unit testing

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,930
and it's gonna add you a component and a

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,270
simple unit test for you so I did the

00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,160
project a couple of weeks ago it was my

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,740
interview for the new place where they

00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,200
wanted graphic UL so I done again I had

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,600
the project just you add the Apolo ap

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,580
Apollo view Apollo that is what is you

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,140
structure to the graph QL as you pull it

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,000
through it actually shows you a real

00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,350
example of a polo you change the end

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,290
point you change a couple lines you go

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,930
everything and you can add extension you

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,880
can remove extension and as a even if

00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:48,990
it's a CLI it should be a common line

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,080
interface actually as a real UI I know

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:54,060
I'm not gonna good I'm not gonna destroy

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,890
my setup yet I'm going to show that

00:18:54,060 --> 00:19:04,920
later because the actual application is

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:06,750
done with the CLA 3 so components as you

00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,100
all put your hands up I think all of you

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,900
know what the component is so I'm not

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,280
really going details of water component

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,160
things and why it's useful

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,810
the one thing I'm gonna say is what is

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,600
the main difference between other

00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:21,570
framework component and view a view

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,790
component is really really simply HTML

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,170
CSS and JavaScript of course as you may

00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,610
expect there are some helper in

00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,040
JavaScript and there's some method and

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:32,040
things that actually make it unique and

00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,900
make it very powerful but at the end of

00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,490
the day you start with HTML CSS and

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,990
JavaScript and you build on top of that

00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,930
and this is I think it's the most

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:42,180
powerful thing why would you use

00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,920
component of course is to reduce

00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,800
duplication so you try to reduce

00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,170
duplication as much as possible he

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,850
standardized things so you're able to

00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,230
create a component so as I mentioned

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,210
before we did we use Tory book

00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,950
internally we started to create style

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,870
guides for our customers we work with

00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,400
banks so the very very hard they provide

00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,940
you with this hundred fifty page style

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,910
guide

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,770
so you create that style guide but then

00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:09,360
what you've been able to do is you know

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:11,970
we we build we build for example a you

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,830
know let's say a block element okay what

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,630
we done then we added accessibility on

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,250
the block element and we added keyboard

00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:20,220
accessibility and then we are the dole

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,690
extra feature for you know for more

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,860
accessibility oh you are at the

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,570
possibility for actually to be more

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,010
responsive so you start to something

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,870
very very small and then you develop

00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,150
over time the good thing with the

00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,650
component is that you think about you

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,090
you got the component in front of you

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,160
you made the changes to the component is

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,320
responsive the whole application becomes

00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,870
responsive at least a component and this

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,310
is what is really really helping us and

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,960
it helps companies because as soon as

00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,500
you sell this to a company so to your

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,750
own boss

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,490
it makes them understand you know the

00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,900
return on investment so yes you have to

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,450
it takes a bit longer to the first

00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,640
component they will do with HTML but

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,290
over time the you know the the cost

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,880
reduction and improvement they work

00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:59,970
should have in that real code has been

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,490
fantastic and then is support standards

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:06,750
so much simpler to keep track of how the

00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:08,790
component over you know and you know how

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,380
the component progress and changes and

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,570
is simple for one person like me to have

00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,370
70 developers who look over them because

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,470
it's one place that you actually go well

00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,240
if someone just change a button in one

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,250
slide or somewhere it will be very hard

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,150
for me to keep a nice everywhere so it

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:25,800
makes things to be more standardized so

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,600
view component you may not be able to

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,030
see that but we actually jump on that so

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,460
this is a very very basic view component

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,930
so in one there are different way of

00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,610
declaring view component so you can

00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,400
actually have even just a template

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,720
literal on you don't you know just a

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,670
simple javascript file with the template

00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,350
later and that's it or there is this

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:48,510
that is what comes with all the view

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:50,340
with all the new you know creation from

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,710
the CLI and to beyond setting for what

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,480
it before what they said in do J's

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,400
London they're moving toward just

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,870
accepting the dot view files for the

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,490
future release so it is for the

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,880
production ready file you will want to

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:06,150
dog view file a dot view file has three

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,160
different parts the template where HTML

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,470
goes in it so normal HTML nothing

00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,410
different a script that is just

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,100
JavaScript and then a style where you

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,110
can actually apply

00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:20,669
whatever you want you are able to then

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:22,350
if you want add extra preprocessor

00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:24,539
things to that to this for example the

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:27,030
style you can decide if you want if you

00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:28,440
want a CSS or less so anything else with

00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,630
the JavaScript you can decide if you

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,820
want typescript or if you want pug I

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,929
think something little different and

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,640
there's something else in JavaScript so

00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,309
there are a few options already out of

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,140
the box for you but at the end of the

00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:41,789
day if you just take this component is

00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,900
going to create a label and it is it

00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:44,850
going to create an input so there's

00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,590
nothing else there's not nothing of you

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:50,130
in there to be honest but the good thing

00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:52,320
of it is that these will then be this

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,210
will create some HTML and differently

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,980
from react you're then able to use the

00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,299
Dom whatever you want so if you had an

00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,909
application that is something on a click

00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:02,130
event the work and this is what is

00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:03,570
really being the main differences for us

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,610
so when you take something you want to

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,780
be within a very big app the fact that

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,820
you're all functionality still works

00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,230
were very important and now slowly we're

00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,919
transporting all the logic within the

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:17,490
component then we make the component a

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:20,190
little bit more interesting so we add a

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,140
little bit of style very similarly to

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,520
react you're able to just have the style

00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,440
that access everything so this one will

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,090
change my label everywhere on site are

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,640
you actually able to make the style

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,260
scoped and that will add a data tag

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,700
store that will make every component

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:37,110
unique and the style will not actually

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:39,450
be it will not not affect the rest of

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:42,600
the website I prefer to actually build

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:45,419
things we don't start scoped and I'm I'm

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:48,390
keen on using IT CSS so every view any

00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:50,580
of you used a tee CSS methodology if

00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,380
you're using components is very simple

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,990
you do everything up to object in your

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,059
IT CSS and then this is the component

00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:02,010
layer you do it right it looks good you

00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:03,470
do it wrong is bad really bad then we

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,580
start to put some real vue.js

00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,890
functionality so what you see here is

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,390
very similar to before the only

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:11,640
difference is that the label is actually

00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,990
now is dynamic so you got something

00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,419
the label is passed through as a

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,070
property so property are information

00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:19,140
that has passed over from a parents or

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,510
from the actual root of the of the

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,520
application and you go through them but

00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:25,929
speed up otherwise we're not gonna go do

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,279
go through the sides

00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:30,940
there are a few things that you need to

00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:33,980
know to start in vue.js two main things

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,720
one is the life cycles of you and the

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,789
second thing is the way you can work

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,629
around and actually pass a properties

00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:43,879
and data cross this seems very confusing

00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:46,340
when reality it shouldn't be because

00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:48,799
it's what the end of the day what you

00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,990
need is a you need to know what before

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,519
month is so before anything is actually

00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,889
is applied to the Dom you are able to

00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,570
trigger something so you will probably

00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:58,909
use a before mount if you're doing a

00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:01,429
graph QR code so you got a component and

00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:03,499
before the mount you can say go and

00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:05,869
fetch this content for me that will

00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:08,590
start to promise it is done at the right

00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:11,299
time of creation for the component

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,889
mounted is when you want to just do

00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:14,389
something after the Dom is created so if

00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:16,070
you go some old JavaScript or anything

00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:18,559
you want to do with the real Dom then

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,999
you want to apply things to you know to

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,860
a node that is actually being shown to

00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:23,330
click event or anything mounted is the

00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,519
right time so you have there where you

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,580
actually do the main bulk of the

00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:32,539
application as you use JavaScript before

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:34,340
and updated updated updated actually can

00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:36,879
be triggered you get triggered

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:40,970
automatically every time that there is a

00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:43,309
rewrite and a redesign of the page if

00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:45,559
you use UJS properly or if you actually

00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:47,299
you can you understand and learn how to

00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:48,559
use it properly you will not use update

00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:50,059
anymore that you start to use the

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,129
reactivity of the component and the way

00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:53,360
everything changes by the end of the day

00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:55,580
those three are the one you really need

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,289
but again this comes from the website

00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,029
for the actual documentation if you go

00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,950
through it tells you everything of what

00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:02,960
each of these steps actually does and

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,299
when is actually they can get used so

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,990
again you can see a very powerful and

00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:11,450
one place to actually see everything

00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:15,080
next slide is on data how do we pass the

00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,409
data cross and how do we use the data we

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,679
go

00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:21,889
props data method computed and lifecycle

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:24,289
hooks so the props are data they come

00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:26,539
from outside so if you say for example I

00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:29,389
got a wet main web page and one of my

00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:30,830
component is blog posts what you can add

00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:33,769
you can have a JavaScript object on the

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,570
main page that that just passed through

00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:37,600
all the data of the blog post so you can

00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,160
say my title mastic on mathematical

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,770
so that's the prop so the props come

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,720
from outside the component cannot change

00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,090
the props so the props are coming from

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,470
outside and accepted in and and they can

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:49,750
you know they can be used for the

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:52,720
component but not change directly the

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,310
data is if you will use closure is a

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,380
private variable so what they usually

00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:58,060
say with the clutter with the data is is

00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,920
the private little variable for a

00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,570
component if you have different

00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,890
components it actually each of them will

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,120
have its own instance of the data and

00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,640
we're actually going to use the property

00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,630
and the data the method and computed all

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,860
of this is actually going to be using

00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:13,720
the exercise neck things we go method so

00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,790
we all know JavaScript we need a way to

00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,170
actually trigger something method is

00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,770
nothing less than a possibility for you

00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:22,840
to create JavaScript functions so you

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,460
can call those function from the

00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,710
component itself so if there is any

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:30,460
event such as a click event you can call

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,990
the functions from a from a mounted for

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,180
example when something when something is

00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,890
returned do this life again if you use

00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,600
reactivity properly you don't even have

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,780
to do that everything is done handled

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,510
for you then we go computed computed

00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:47,770
actually is very is better phrase if you

00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:49,570
called it computed properties so you may

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,610
have information coming in so save

00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:53,590
account where you go to blog post and

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,070
the blog post accepts the title and

00:27:53,590 --> 00:28:00,280
accepts an article the article can be

00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,870
2,000 words if you want to create a your

00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,670
own property if you want to do something

00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:06,490
that is actually is a dynamic property

00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,720
you will use computed property so in our

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,130
example what we're going to do we're

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,900
going to take this title in these big

00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:13,360
articles and we're going to create a

00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,670
computed property over snippets of just

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,410
20 words so what this doing is going to

00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:20,020
go through taking the article coming in

00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:22,090
Java you know just make it a subset of

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:24,130
it and show it the good thing of

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,040
computed is that they are cached so if

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,650
nothing changes is fine but as soon as

00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,780
you change it props the touch is part of

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,210
the computed property they automatically

00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,800
change so I'll give an example you with

00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,750
read view you can actually if you have a

00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,550
main JSON object and you change an

00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,100
article so i've changing one single line

00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:44,020
of it that will go through that will go

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,120
through the component it will change the

00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,840
way it looks but the computer will do

00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,040
perfectly the same

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,450
automatically so you don't have to

00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,490
trigger anything so the javascript code

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,290
they actually do will be

00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,260
unless and you would see the power of

00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:56,880
these in three lines of code

00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,670
next is the lifecycle hooks so as I say

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,710
before you go if you got a graph QL API

00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,510
you may not need to know what you have

00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,000
to do there is a chance of using also

00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,140
messages so if any of you is a little

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,240
bit about you know is a back-end

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,610
developer you use signal are there is a

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,590
possibility that is a messaging bus

00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,540
actually building within view so you're

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,520
able to trigger messages and the message

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,230
can actually do you know when whatever

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,350
you want and it's very powerful so we

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:24,540
created a little validation plug-in

00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:26,790
using the messages so very simply you

00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,950
just start you know we got input fields

00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,630
and those input fields we have created

00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,980
the logic within that Roxy a validation

00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,290
and you don't have to do anything else

00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:38,600
and just pass the rule object like you

00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:42,059
were used to doing jQuery validate so

00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,820
it's time to break things guys so we are

00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:46,800
going to build a very small application

00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,100
so just accept you know that's it things

00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:54,630
like a blog post a little magazine okay

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:58,550
we are gonna do that now disclaimer

00:29:54,630 --> 00:30:05,790
sorry in advance if something goes wrong

00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:06,960
so let me see where shall I start so the

00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:11,160
first thing we're going to do guys is

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:15,210
I'm going to show you the know that I'm

00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:17,450
going to show you the CLI v3 so no

00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:25,620
showing that's why everyone is working

00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:28,320
sorry so if I share it okay so don't

00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,390
think about the code yet think about the

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,420
terminal so what I'm gonna show I'm

00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:35,429
gonna run the CLI okay if you run the

00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,620
CLI you just as I said just an NPM

00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:40,080
package so you know every view probably

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:44,540
is a word how to use an NPM and actually

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,540
for the destruction everything else so

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,880
so this is still in beta beta version

00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,750
and it's been for over a year now so

00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,150
don't know what they're waiting to

00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:59,790
actually release it so you start up you

00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,410
are at the CLI you got this you're able

00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,240
to have multiple project so as you can

00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,920
see it's actually I go you know there is

00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,550
a chance for you to actually move with

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,840
you multiple project and you're able to

00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,920
create a new project I'm not going to

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,820
show you now because I don't want to

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,830
mess it up but when you create a new

00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,140
project you actually go now a UI where

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,550
you can select and you know it's simpler

00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,020
for people to get it data getting

00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:22,410
started to really understand what is

00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:24,930
going on we go with the plugins you are

00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,550
able to you know as you know all NPM and

00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,350
everything is allowed in me as much

00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,850
simply so as you can see he allows you

00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,710
it tells you straight away use view

00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,300
action view rotor rotor because most

00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,450
people actually add it if you want to

00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:38,130
add a plug-in you just do this you add

00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,950
it and as you add it it actually adds

00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:42,930
the he asks you if you want an example

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:44,190
an example for it so if you are at the

00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,410
the pluggy

00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,970
at the Apollo plugins one of the

00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,610
configuration is would you like me to

00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:52,290
create in a poll a local Apollo web

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,520
server for you and if you say yes

00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,320
actually does everything so you don't

00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,090
have to do anything else after that but

00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,160
then better say no because they didn't

00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:02,010
know which files to remove so you know

00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,420
use with care and so each of the plugins

00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,010
has its own configuration and as I say

00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,500
that done fantastic job so if they go

00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:09,810
here you see this is just a visual

00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,180
representation of the JSON file package

00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:13,650
dot JSON when you go in configuration

00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,640
you can see what kind of configuration

00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:19,680
can be set so look this is the es lint

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,660
configuration you go there you change

00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,100
the settings you know which settings and

00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,590
this one saves into your config you

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,520
don't have to think about you know the

00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:30,630
hundreds and look you're going routes

00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,680
isn't simple you change the you change

00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,410
the JSON object you're done

00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,310
you save it you got it you know all this

00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:40,500
is actually doing at the background is

00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:42,750
is running is running commands for you

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,730
so the guys did a really great job and

00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,820
and then when you go in tasks this is

00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:49,560
the things that I probably act the most

00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,810
these are all the NPM run so you got the

00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,430
serve you got the link to the run yes

00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,620
lintel you go to unit tests so for

00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,600
example if I go in unit test you're able

00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,350
to see that you got something that is a

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,130
bit more visual and I I went to talk

00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:05,040
when one of the guy

00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,320
I wrote a plug-in for the for the for

00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,610
the CLI three and in two minutes he

00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,560
actually creates the plug-in to do

00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:12,330
something I had not tried in myself he

00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,410
always look good during talks so I'm not

00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:17,250
I'm not telling you that it's actually

00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:18,780
simple but you know straight away you

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,700
you can actually run this and you can

00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,020
set as parameter to run continuously and

00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,410
things that are you can see you can

00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,430
watch the file automatically run I think

00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,110
simple for me to explain this as if we

00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,860
were going through the CLI and that's

00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,200
the important thing

00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:34,320
you have lint and and then if you serve

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,670
it he actually gives you also a little

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,920
bit of information so all this

00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:41,930
information actually are available in

00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:44,370
the code that word that no WordPress

00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:47,190
project the code that is actually split

00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:49,080
out in the in the console but this would

00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,750
be more readable so you're able to see

00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,880
the time it talks you know and as you

00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,680
progress again you also see the speed

00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,980
test and everything else so he started

00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,840
it starts to give it start to make this

00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,940
is more visual so people will start to

00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,740
think about this a bit more if he is on

00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,510
a very long list of things that come on

00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,710
on the common prompt you're not going to

00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,240
really look at it under the fact that

00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:11,310
he's gone from six seconds to twenty

00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,510
five minutes so this is probably going

00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,280
to support people actually getting

00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,679
better it shows you the dependencies the

00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,300
size of it and so on and so forth so

00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,730
we're going to do today I started the

00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:24,780
application so if actually going open a

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:28,169
new tab you could view just what this is

00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,639
this is the actual this is actually the

00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:31,710
component that will get created when you

00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,840
create a new a new app with vue.js

00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,899
so when you do a when you create a new

00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:39,750
app in in you know in the in this in the

00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:40,980
CLI or in the new UI you got something

00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,840
similar to that of course it doesn't say

00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,389
be suggest I tried to over a dozen and

00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,010
but it gives you essential links it

00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,330
gives a gives you that key system and

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,060
actually supports you in getting started

00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:53,429
straightaway and I can guarantee you

00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,960
that you actually you follow this link

00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:58,860
syl gives you enough information to

00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,240
actually get started before we jump

00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:04,530
through and want to show you code

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:08,520
sandbox very similarly so if you can

00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:12,510
consume a code sandbox you you do go in

00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:15,840
code view and it creates pump a view up

00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,970
for you so this guy is very

00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,980
very clever using Western web web

00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:22,530
assemblies so everything is actually is

00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,480
all the power has been taken by my

00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:26,520
browser and this is the component that

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,410
gets shown so this is what the web app

00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,120
actually looks like it sorry a viewer

00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,830
pack should look like it start so

00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,750
there's one simple single component and

00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,310
what they've done as you can see the

00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,390
component is just HTML then there

00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,860
nothing wrong with it the only thing

00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:45,840
that they poo is a message just to show

00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:47,310
the simplicity of it no so we got this

00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,930
first link what we're going to do as I

00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:51,030
said where the end result is going to be

00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:54,600
something like this so I'm not really

00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:56,970
going to focus on the style guys and I'm

00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,350
not designer as you can see I can do

00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:01,440
better than that but that's really bad

00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:03,390
so what they're going to do is so this

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,670
is it there are going to be a couple of

00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,050
components so the main page you know

00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:13,050
nothing special we're not going to go on

00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:16,790
details we go a new snapshot component

00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:19,080
and then we're using a mixings for

00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,610
accessibility just to show you how is

00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,990
our is is actually to create a mixed

00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,180
scenes that can be exciting it can be

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,490
reused everywhere and then we're going

00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:30,810
to show you likes and the likes are

00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:32,610
actually is an implementation of of the

00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:34,110
of the data so it shows you that if I

00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:36,030
change the like like on one component

00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,470
that's affected one and then we're going

00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,510
to show you the show full article that

00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:40,650
is the implementation of computed

00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,580
properties so we're going to go through

00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:47,760
these in stages or twist we try to they

00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:49,800
say we're here this is our first stop of

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,030
course with all the new app is all hot

00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,010
reloaded so you don't have to do

00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,450
anything it's nice and that's it simple

00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,000
so we're going to do I want to show you

00:36:54,450 --> 00:37:00,290
as well

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,290
sorry let's go on the next tab maybe

00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,170
what you got what view actually shows so

00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:16,130
can every can everyone see this or do I

00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:18,810
need to make it bigger so this is a view

00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:21,240
add-on for Chrome and Firefox there is

00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:23,150
none for edge or Internet Explorer if

00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,410
you're using it you're in the wrong work

00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,720
so what the actual allows you to is a

00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,880
lot your lives it allows you through to

00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,200
go through the component so near shows

00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,720
that my main component is called net

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,030
magazine and then there is a component

00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,410
called hello world and it shows you what

00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,520
kind of data that are they will show you

00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,950
the properties you will show you the

00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,080
computer properties you have any if you

00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,430
go view X it shows that if you go event

00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,650
it can show you the bent and these are

00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:48,510
the messages I was talking before show

00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,160
you the route routing so in you know you

00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:53,220
can actually analyze and see if it goes

00:37:50,160 --> 00:38:05,780
through you can add time you can also

00:37:53,220 --> 00:38:05,780
change at times I did say times o what

00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:14,100
he actually changes yeah thank you two

00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:16,440
points then this one is actually be

00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,360
added in the last release so when I'd go

00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,980
ready for this yesterday the performance

00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,530
tab wasn't there and this morning appear

00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,750
death or less awful make sure is not a

00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,640
break in change and everything that's

00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,560
actually changed so it's really powerful

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,690
you will be able to understand as you go

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,130
through this the first problem you're

00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,660
gonna have is oh I can't see the data

00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,680
why is it I cannot see the data you will

00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,510
be able to go through and say wait a

00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,710
minute the data stops here or the name

00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,600
is not the same or there's a spelling

00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,860
mistakes it's very simple for people to

00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,930
get start on the stand what is going

00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,340
wrong so we're going to go through that

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:47,250
and what we're going to do a going to

00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,690
create our first component so I've

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,700
cheated a bit because everything is

00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:54,320
already is ready and just commented out

00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:56,610
so this will be a very basic component

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,620
there's nothing dynamic on it and this

00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:00,570
is all you need if you actually are

00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,790
importing the JavaScript you don't even

00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:05,790
need the name so the name is just needed

00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:07,170
if you are adding each component to the

00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,180
to the view instance but if you actually

00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,880
importing it with a zone name you don't

00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,250
really need the name either

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,610
it's diff and h1 is a P tag so not very

00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:18,110
useful but it still be useful

00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,490
you're using these for the header and

00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:21,170
the footer on your website and you want

00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,270
to share it across you know it's I know

00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,610
it's not extremely useful but it's a

00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:27,290
good a start what we're going to do we

00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:30,380
are going I'm going to show you the app

00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:32,780
okay so don't think about the competitor

00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,910
a commented out information what you

00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:37,310
have is JavaScript on the very top and

00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,750
if they go be further up you see I can

00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:41,660
you read this I can make this bigger if

00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:47,360
you want are you okay on the back be

00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:50,440
bigger okay I can make it bigger but

00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:55,220
then I say we'll make it bigger why not

00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:57,320
big is better so we can close to do this

00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,770
we don't need it anymore so what you can

00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:02,660
see we got a template okay

00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:04,220
template you put whichever jobs HTML you

00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,780
want in it as you can see most of it is

00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,770
actually normal JavaScript is nothing

00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,980
the only difference you will probably

00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:11,090
see is the hello world so this is one of

00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,520
the viewer component they've actually

00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,840
created it's a very simple component

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,220
because I'm not passing anything to it

00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,810
so it's actually the component that I'm

00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,610
calling I'm not passing any properties

00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:21,680
nothing is just a component so you could

00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:24,410
create a header and footer no passing

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,240
any done any dynamic date on it we go

00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:29,240
through that we got will be down we go a

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,010
the script tags in the script tags you

00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,590
can have more JavaScript as you may

00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,670
expect we have a name that is the name

00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,480
of the component as I say is

00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,310
non-mandatory

00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,400
and then you got the data so as I said

00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:43,010
before the data is is the private part

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,260
so the data is it's owned by this

00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:47,660
component that is my app dot view and

00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:50,540
then you can pass okay it can be passed

00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:52,190
over to the children but is not shared

00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,690
across different component if there are

00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:55,940
the same layers and the children can not

00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:57,950
change it they can not change it so in

00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,370
our case we are going to work on noobs

00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:03,170
news and we are we're going to have a

00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:05,210
couple titles and a very long articles

00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,920
what you can see as well this is knitted

00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:10,250
length just to show that you can set

00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,860
default and so on so forth if you go

00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:15,860
down we go methods I'm not using it and

00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:18,590
we go the different components that have

00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:21,230
already loaded in and then we go mix-ins

00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:23,660
mixings are very very powerful if you

00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:26,930
know what to use and how to use it so we

00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:28,980
mainly used mix-ins four so if you're

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:32,070
doing an application I would have a

00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,869
and apollo apollo api mixing so

00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,820
something that just accepts a do dis

00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:37,740
query with the query title and that's

00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,359
all the rest for you he can trigger it

00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,980
can add properties to a component you

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,720
can have in this case and accessibility

00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,310
make sense or you can have a validate

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,890
mixing so if you know how to build mix

00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:48,750
ins they're very powerful when you are

00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:53,310
the mixes to the page a mix sense is

00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:55,710
just the script tags of overview J's so

00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:58,020
you ask Nick mixings as his own data as

00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,910
his own properties as his own method as

00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,880
its own computed properties so when you

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:05,369
are the mix ins on an object he actually

00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:07,200
increased the properties the except the

00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:10,640
increase the data so you can really play

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,170
you can do so much with it

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,400
style-wise as you can see looks really

00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,600
bad so we're not going to go through the

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,630
style but in this case as you can see

00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,550
I'm actually using a CSS what I'm going

00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:23,630
to do next we're going to go through the

00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:29,340
first step so I'm gonna create a little

00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:32,010
newer new snapshot and I'm gonna have

00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:34,200
little oh I think you want to do know

00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:37,560
that's the second stage yeah

00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,480
very simple new snapshot is going to

00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,850
accept something so a title and an

00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,090
article and as you can see I got them as

00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,890
the properties properties are they can

00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:48,270
be very simple like in this case where

00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,619
you can actually specify if it's a

00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,510
string if it's a boolean if it's an

00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:53,550
object an array so you actually go some

00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:57,030
typing as well there so if I try to pass

00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,500
a number it'll actually break it doesn't

00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,180
doesn't render so you know there's a

00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,560
little bit of power in there even if we

00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:04,770
know JavaScript should be nice and

00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:07,800
flexible but a little bit of a little

00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:09,210
bit of powerful integration err what you

00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,160
can do you can actually have different

00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,270
properties you can have validation on

00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,720
each of the properties you can have

00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:19,410
default you can have addition default do

00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:21,750
something else remember are you do

00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,340
remember but if there is more in there

00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,900
that I think probably it actually shows

00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,940
in the next one but they're really

00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,380
powerful but again you can start from

00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,930
something very very simple this is

00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:32,730
nothing there and you can go validation

00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,260
before that you can actually say if is

00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:37,380
required or not so you can you can build

00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:41,420
something so this one let's here we

00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:43,790
renders so we actually go we go here and

00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,829
do something really bad so we we showed

00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,990
the new snapshot so I'm importing it

00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:49,730
here so I'm just gonna write a new star

00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,710
snapshot so this my new component now

00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,420
normal HTML nothing to worry about

00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,099
so for our grads what we did initially

00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,260
we gave them and say these are the

00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,670
components this is what we do look at

00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,309
them in storybook to see what properties

00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:03,500
except use it so as you know how to use

00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:06,140
an input tag you can use this and they

00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:09,319
started to that be bind is what to say

00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:11,150
what what object you want to pass

00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:13,130
through so if they wanted to I can

00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,990
actually I could have our code are coded

00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,309
the joy at the object in there but what

00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,960
I'm actually doing I'm gonna say you

00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:21,740
have to take the the first element of

00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:27,290
the news so if I do this and I do this

00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:29,420
as well I go my talk to my okay oh look

00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:31,250
at that I got the component and it's

00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,410
actually working so that's a good start

00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:36,049
of course we don't want to go through

00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:37,130
and actually add all the object one by

00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:39,049
one otherwise it's not going to be

00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:43,309
really dynamic so what I'm gonna do I'm

00:44:39,049 --> 00:44:44,990
gonna use a one of the first I think

00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:46,160
they're called directives and never

00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:48,589
managed to understand if it's the right

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,540
word one the first view directives of

00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:51,740
view helper that is for example view for

00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:53,780
it'll go through the object and apply

00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:56,390
that object so what this is doing and

00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:58,910
say you know JavaScript guys so go into

00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:00,770
each of you get me in an item in an

00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:02,839
index and just go through that and every

00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:06,460
time just append item so I do this I

00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,460
save you on that one

00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:16,759
but yeah still the same result okay

00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:18,039
first of all I want to remove these is

00:45:16,759 --> 00:45:22,009
really annoying

00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:24,619
yeah but okay so same results we go to

00:45:22,009 --> 00:45:26,689
view and directive the first question

00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:28,309
probably ask is you probably have is how

00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:32,509
many directives there are I would what

00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:36,679
which one they are so they go here is an

00:45:32,509 --> 00:45:40,189
example of it okay so if you go to v4 so

00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:41,839
we got V text we show V if we else you

00:45:40,189 --> 00:45:44,179
got to bind the model the model is very

00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,369
very powerful is a big more complex and

00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:47,749
advanced by is useful input fields so

00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,249
what the model does he actually takes

00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:51,049
the value did the field is changing you

00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:52,369
can do so much with it is it's a bit

00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:55,789
more complex and I'm not going to go

00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:59,419
through that you have where's the view

00:45:55,789 --> 00:46:00,890
for you go all the VINs some key on

00:45:59,419 --> 00:46:02,419
everything so you can trigger it very

00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:04,459
simply you can trigger your own method

00:46:02,419 --> 00:46:06,049
or a normal JavaScript method for a year

00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:08,659
or actually change something you can

00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:11,479
load components and all this can

00:46:08,659 --> 00:46:13,939
actually work with a synchronous

00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:15,769
requesting anything else so I'm gonna

00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:18,529
speed up a bit so you can go through

00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:20,449
here and actually you can see the power

00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:23,809
of it so as I say you go to v4 that is

00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:24,859
here you got the on you got this show so

00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:28,039
you don't have to do any JavaScript

00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:30,709
everything just works first time every

00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:31,909
time so we're gonna go here now what

00:46:30,709 --> 00:46:33,380
we're going to do we're going to make it

00:46:31,909 --> 00:46:36,999
a little bit more interesting so I'm

00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,999
gonna open them all so I don't have to

00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:42,949
more interesting and we're going to do

00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:44,239
this as I mentioned before I'm going to

00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:46,909
show you all the computed properties

00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,439
actually works so I'm not changing

00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:50,269
anything easy to see from the main app

00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:52,429
I'm actually passing the same title and

00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:53,839
the same object so think of these as I'm

00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:56,089
upgrading the object by myself no one

00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:58,909
knows about it what is actually adding

00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:01,819
it is beyond so on click or the actual

00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:04,099
div is triggering this method that's

00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,659
what is doing the title we've seen it

00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:08,630
before and the article we've seen before

00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:10,219
what is actually doing is saying is the

00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:12,019
show in snippet is true

00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:13,279
I want you to show this new post so I'm

00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:14,899
going to show you a few things now that

00:47:13,279 --> 00:47:18,319
is starting to be a bit more complicated

00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:19,399
but stay with me and if you go any

00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:22,759
question or something that you learn

00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:24,450
aluminum so first thing extend you're

00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:26,940
able to create a very basic version of

00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:29,070
and extend on top of it so an example in

00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,530
our workplace we got a button the button

00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:33,540
actually does the log log so every time

00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:35,400
you click on a button it locks it for

00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,230
auditing purposes so we created the

00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,690
button but then we created the download

00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:41,160
button an upload button and another kind

00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,410
of button so you can create something

00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,329
simple going on top of it and you know

00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,859
you know you go enough unit testing on

00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:49,710
the actual component not to not to

00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:53,640
destroy anything else we got the data

00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:56,940
for the first time so we got some some

00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,040
information coming from outside as you

00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:02,420
can see guys the title and article are

00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:09,770
not Shoshone because they're in article

00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:09,770
so you know before AI defined as Nutella

00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,740
so you remember this the properties of

00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:18,780
title and article I don't need to define

00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:20,760
it anymore because I'm extending

00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,380
articles so I'm expanding the

00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,109
functionality of article and if I want

00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,820
to I could actually override the

00:48:25,109 --> 00:48:28,500
property so I can say title now is

00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,700
actually required in this component and

00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,430
you can do that in create different

00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:34,680
components we are using a data so when

00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:35,940
this starts this is the only nasty thing

00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,680
that they got in the whole application

00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:41,400
and the guy who created it hates this

00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,930
but you can't take it off so you write

00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,339
whatever you want in there and in this

00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:46,290
case we got a variable called showy

00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:48,000
snippets that he starts to throw because

00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,650
this is the data we can change this

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,560
within the component anything else we

00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:53,819
can't do it within the component itself

00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:56,220
then I'm going to created a cached or

00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:59,250
computer properties called snippets so

00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:01,050
as you can see it's lipids is used the

00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:02,640
same way as article a same waist title

00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:05,520
so think of it as a property but then

00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,869
you create on the fly very simple

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,180
JavaScript guys it takes the full

00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:11,369
article it takes the first ten

00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:14,609
characters it shows it with the dot dot

00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:16,349
dot nothing different yeah and then what

00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:18,660
I'm doing as I say I don't click I'm

00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:20,430
doing toggle article to toggle article

00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:22,829
so what there is a toggle article method

00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:25,589
that's all and this is actually changing

00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:28,740
the data so you say take the DS dot show

00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:30,300
it snippets and do it inverse inverse so

00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:35,240
if I go back to the application guys and

00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:35,240
I just click one two three

00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:49,620
I'm telling you you're not my friend

00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:50,760
anymore so why should you it's fine and

00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,340
I should next one because there's no

00:49:50,760 --> 00:50:00,240
much so these actually walked 15 seconds

00:49:53,340 --> 00:50:01,770
ago it's fine let me go I just got four

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,390
minutes I'll jump over the next one will

00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:08,810
work and confident guys

00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:11,790
oh you mean this one yes you're right

00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:15,210
guys clever guys look at that so we got

00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:16,500
something if I click on it as you can

00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:18,540
see each of them actually have his own

00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,910
state so it's not changing all of it if

00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,410
every day change down very nasty return

00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:24,000
if you change one is change all of them

00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:25,500
so that's the only thing again you've

00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,180
gone to view documentation they go a

00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,960
counter example that is fantastic to

00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:34,100
their next and last on is not really

00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:39,480
lost sorry

00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:44,610
next we go this one so what we're doing

00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:45,720
is snapshot zero very similar to before

00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,790
there is an image I didn't make a

00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,620
dynamic a coup def there is a couple of

00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:52,380
buttons this one's triggered article and

00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,600
there is a gain more dynamic text there

00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:56,160
is like so now I'm just adding likes so

00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,690
there's some data with his own likes and

00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,610
every time you create this component

00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:01,920
will ever likes will have his own

00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:03,810
counter of the likes it's a toggle

00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,670
contrast so when you click that or that

00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:08,190
shouldn't be there and then there is a

00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:10,950
toggle hi contracts for accessibility if

00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:12,480
you go through that you see that there's

00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:14,280
nothing for accessibility so I got the

00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,900
title I got the article snippet length

00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,280
so as you can see you can see that is

00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,660
not required that if you don't put

00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,610
anything is going to be 20 but you can

00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,680
actually have a longer one and there you

00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:24,570
go some data so the likes and showing

00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,190
these very similar to before and only

00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:27,870
thing is changing the button text now so

00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:29,130
if he's not showing the button if you're

00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:31,950
showing the snippet is a show full

00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:34,230
article otherwise so very simple we go

00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:36,180
50 lines includes HTML and JavaScript

00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,710
and what you also see there is a mixing

00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,810
so now I'm using for the first time

00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:42,150
something a bit more advanced there'll

00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:45,000
be more complex as I say mixings are

00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:47,160
just a JavaScript portion of the view

00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,500
template you got properties so you got

00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:52,100
these properties coming through

00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:54,740
and the only thing I'm doing is there is

00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,870
a data so each of the components using

00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:59,210
it will have his own and then I'm just

00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:01,550
using javascript to change the

00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:02,870
background that's what I'm doing okay so

00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,510
if there's more time I'll talk to it

00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:11,750
about whether done so we go through that

00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:13,820
and toggle like stock elastic or not and

00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:16,490
the only thing I want to show you as

00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:19,610
well that on the app I'm actually adding

00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:21,200
the mix-ins on the actual main app so

00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:22,400
I'm using the mixings in different

00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,580
location and all of them will actually

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,650
enhance the feature of my actual amount

00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,220
so they go up I think oh this is right

00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,410
good

00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,760
so if I go back now as you can see I got

00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,490
an image so it's a bit different there

00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,200
are three buttons if I click on do like

00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:38,990
you can see that this one is changing

00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,600
this one is not the best thing if I go

00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:43,010
into view jazz and it go on the snapshot

00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,130
you can see that there is the data or

00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:47,540
one this is each day and this all the

00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:49,250
information from accessibility because

00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,990
they blowed the accessibility mixing so

00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:54,980
again it's very powerful you actually

00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:56,570
set what I'm also doing is I want to

00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:59,120
show the full article as you can see

00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:02,930
this still works and I want to toggle

00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:07,790
the high contrast and to clip back if L

00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:09,320
do it ania is the same so again all this

00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:11,060
is all others from default you can

00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,740
override so because these are properties

00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:15,140
of a specific components you can

00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:19,460
actually change those properties I think

00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:21,620
I've one last thing that he stays so

00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:24,310
again very similar to before you got the

00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:27,170
click and I'm calling toggle high

00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:29,210
contrast when you go here there's no

00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:31,120
method for it so again because I'm

00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:33,710
loading the mix in the mix since loads

00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:36,200
everything he loads the properties the

00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,850
data the method the computer method so

00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,620
it's really powerful when you see be

00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:41,720
insane so how many times guys you do

00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:44,810
things that you have to repeat so as I

00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:46,370
say it can be logging it can be auditing

00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:48,170
for your own things to see you know how

00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,640
the websites actually do you can you may

00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:51,350
have a counter you want to know how long

00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,880
you spend on each page you want you can

00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,470
have a mix since the does that we could

00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,840
omit mixing says access to accessibility

00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:59,150
and he has access to all the lifecycle

00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:01,130
so you can say when it's mounted starts

00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:02,360
I start counted when it's destroyed stop

00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:05,240
you know how long it's been actually

00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:08,150
literate three lines of code is very

00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,530
powerful so I actually save that so

00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,180
let's see if he actually works so as you

00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:13,100
can see there's a toggle toggle contrast

00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:14,570
here and actually that's it tune all of

00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,150
them the only reason why is not applying

00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:19,610
to this one it's because I've already

00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:22,160
doubled them so if actually click the

00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:24,500
page to do this you see that is actually

00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,180
it's taking control of everything but

00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,250
then of course you know this is where

00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,440
you're going to advanced part of the

00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:32,360
view because I'm actually changing the

00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,580
things myself now there is a state of

00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,830
its own colors for this for this

00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:38,060
component so the date of this component

00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,650
is not shared by the one and there is

00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,420
more you know you start to go in a more

00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:43,610
advanced feature but as you start to

00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:46,820
look into it it's very very simple to

00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:49,490
understand so if I go back here so you

00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:51,590
see that the these days actually false

00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:54,860
for this one and the next one

00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:56,960
the his day is actually true and a

00:54:54,860 --> 00:55:00,080
simple start things have to change

00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,440
I don't think I have anything goes to

00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,920
show I think I should enough oh I got 30

00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,030
seconds so yeah I think I should enough

00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,280
so they say I have not touched the

00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:11,810
messaging that is very very powerful

00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,030
because it will be a bit too complex but

00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:16,400
the other things that view auctioneer's

00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:17,960
is as I say a synchronous work with

00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:23,450
promises so this is an example that I

00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:27,800
did he actually uses there is a there is

00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:29,180
a animations were all part of it so very

00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,250
simply with three lines of code you're

00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:33,890
able to do these kind of things and

00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:36,890
you're able to go so it's very something

00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:38,450
stupid you know for me it took four

00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:40,220
hours in half for me to add these that

00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:41,900
he goes to the real github API with

00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:44,060
apologize with animation and everything

00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,980
else this one could be better so it

00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:48,220
doesn't take that long to actually go

00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:52,250
through so it's really really powerful

00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:54,580
any questions thank you so much guys for

00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,580
coming

00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,980
