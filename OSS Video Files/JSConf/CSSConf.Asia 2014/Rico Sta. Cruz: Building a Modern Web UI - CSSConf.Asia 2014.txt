[Music]

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:18,300
[Applause]

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,730
and okay hello hi hello yes it's a year

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:37,579
today by the way guys didn't know hello

00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:40,250
and 2014 is actually what I think a very

00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:43,400
good year to be doing web development

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,650
and me like what are you guys here

00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,040
probably well probably all of you guys

00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:53,089
pretty much do things in a browser and

00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:55,160
and I think as a web developer I'm just

00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:56,960
gonna share with you guys I kind of feel

00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,899
like our profession is a little taken

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,969
for granted around here and there's this

00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:05,089
pretty good studio that's pretty

00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:08,920
well-known Tehan and lex and this is

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:12,740
their tagline it says if an atlas screen

00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:16,070
we will design for it and it's it's a

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,259
very bold claim to make and it's

00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,229
actually probably what every one of you

00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:23,300
guys do your day-to-day imagine that if

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:24,979
it has a screen we will build her it

00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,070
will design for it and that is what we

00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:29,780
do what I do and what you guys do every

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:34,040
day and I think that's some brilliant

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:37,280
thing and all of that is like what

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:41,479
happened after like decades of history

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,369
of web development so at some point in

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,130
the past you know what development

00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,049
wasn't really much no one really thought

00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,369
of it so much you know there's pretty

00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:52,659
much content with things that look like

00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:55,250
this but of course history happened and

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,780
at some point people got together and

00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,820
said like hey let's standardize this

00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,070
thing called HTML and stop fighting over

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,079
what should be standards and let's just

00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,630
mandate this is what should be going on

00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,269
moving forward and this was something

00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,040
that was pretty hard to do over at that

00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:12,079
time if you could understand if you guys

00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,450
are familiar with these kinds of things

00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:20,570
and that happened just last millennium

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:23,090
97 and fast-forward many many years a

00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,340
couple of things happen until the

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,640
invention of something called I believe

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:34,280
it's called a smart phone yeah so that's

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,360
the smart phone yeah so okay might say

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,770
I'm a little unfair calling that

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,980
smartphone because there were other

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:44,160
smartphones before that but reality is

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,290
after that came out everything else just

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,920
kind of looked like that anyway so might

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,990
as well anyway a couple of a couple of

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,300
more years going along we have so many

00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,670
ideas we have so many technologies

00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,920
coming forward external five CSS and

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,700
eventually we came into this whole idea

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,550
of like hey maybe we could design for

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,870
any screen in the world which is the

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,110
same things that we have been using the

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,120
whole time then turns out the technology

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,390
to do that has been around for way too

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,340
long and media queries have been you

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,020
know it's been existing before anyone

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,290
ever thought of responsive design this

00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:25,170
is an article from OS depart and that

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,500
was just 2010 and media crews were

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,630
already existing way back then so that

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,030
sort of thing just happened around 2010

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,790
and a couple of other things just came

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:39,150
up and we have so many things that we

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,299
could do on a browser on your computer

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,250
on your phone we can get someone from

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,040
one point of the country to another and

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,560
tell them the exact directions right on

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,019
your browser and we could play videos

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,610
we've made text editors I think there's

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,730
like two at least two out of know

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,780
there's probably even more than that

00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:02,580
text editors IDs made in just a browser

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:07,110
we've made games in a browser but I

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:09,000
think after all these developments over

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,360
the year searches this one Corino

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,360
problem that nobody has ever really

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,820
solved elegantly in the realm of

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,739
browsing and in the realm of web

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,310
development and I think that is vertical

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,310
centering

00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:29,069
so that's it I'm Rico Santa Cruz you

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,729
might know me around some open source

00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:34,650
project as our star cruise and this is

00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:39,210
me talking about how to use flexbox to

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,590
save your sanity all right okay going

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,009
back to your vertical centering so I

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:46,379
went to the Internet like everyone does

00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:49,139
everyday looking for answers and it came

00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:52,259
across this and it's been asked five

00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,779
years ago and just like so many answers

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,789
those fourteen answers on this one and

00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:00,900
they had to lock the thread because

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:02,550
people kept responding and I don't know

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,960
at some point I'm sure everyone has

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,159
thought of like how do you do vertical

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,669
centering and when I was like mute CCSS

00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:13,289
I mean when this whole CSS positioning

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,500
thing was just really taking off I

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:20,099
thought it was really easy you know I

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,689
thought it was just like this so that's

00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,599
my purse at temp and probably everyone

00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:26,400
else is too right and this is for those

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,529
who haven't done that this is what it

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,639
looks like so obviously that's not

00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:34,409
really gonna work so you go back and see

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,900
like what did you do wrong maybe there's

00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:38,940
something you've missed maybe Center or

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,150
not middle and you go like oh I know

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,199
maybe you should use it to container and

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:47,069
after that this is what it looks like

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:50,159
and you go back and still don't really

00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:52,560
know maybe it's both and maybe it'll

00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:57,330
work and this is again what it looks

00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,000
like so it's not really a solution so I

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,839
went on the internet very recently and

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,099
looked like how do people solve this so

00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:06,449
if you guys want to do that right now go

00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:08,969
ahead but I've done the research for you

00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm just gonna show you okay if it's

00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:12,750
just one line you do a line height trick

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,089
wherein you set the same line height for

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,219
the same height if it's a fixed type you

00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:20,430
could do like a position:absolute top

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:22,379
50% did I get it margin you could do

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,080
something like a table sell you can do

00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:28,320
fixed margin top you can do pretty much

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,900
I don't know there's like 10 odors and

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,350
ran out of space of the slide so there

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,190
are so many ways to do it anyway moving

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,900
forward there's this thing called

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,330
flexbox I'm not sure if you guys right a

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,800
bit I'm sure you guys have but I'm sure

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,780
not everyone has really used it because

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,310
you know everyone's kind of averse to

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,190
using it anyway it's really really

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,450
simple really simple actually there are

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,920
very long articles I was very

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,050
intimidated about it but it turns out

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,480
it's all really broken down to just two

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,040
basic things you just set something on

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,710
the container and set something on the

00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,890
on the items something called display

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,710
flex and flex something so it's very

00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:07,890
perfect for things like for for

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,450
basically app you eyes and you know

00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,370
these kinds of things that can tend to

00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:14,990
pop up every now and then like sidebars

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:18,060
and menus and stuff like that and

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:21,600
there's a little quick yet to dispel a

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,840
couple of beauties flex lock is actually

00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,210
pretty well supported right now so these

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,330
is these are the browsers that support

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,130
the new version of flex box there's

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,900
actually two versions of flex box the

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,270
old one and a new one this is the the

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,950
one with the support for the new ones if

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,380
you notice these are very recent

00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:43,920
browsers and if you go back to the ones

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:46,650
that support the old syntax and it's

00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,830
even actually way back whether it's

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:53,010
Firefox - I don't even remember that an

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:57,030
Android Eclair right and that's pretty

00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:59,730
much 2006 so we've actually had browsers

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:04,940
that support flex bucks for a while now

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:07,350
the only stickler here is IE 10 so it's

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,090
it's not really good if you're targeting

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,600
IE but if you're making something that

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,370
targets mobile and ipads iphones that's

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,280
pretty good because you're probably not

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:20,820
really caring about that so much anyway

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,100
and if you use flexbox for things like

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,530
these these are pretty much what is

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,650
really made for you just really set like

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:32,280
a display flex on the container and you

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,380
set something called flex and the items

00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,599
and that's pretty much what all we need

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,410
to do and there's just three magic

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,030
numbers and they mean these things

00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,490
basically

00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,790
so all you really need to do is display

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:50,760
flex on a container and the item

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,920
something called flex property and it

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,860
just is really as three magic numbers

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,530
yes it looks it's emitting it's actually

00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,750
pretty simple grow is usually like zero

00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,000
or one if it's what it means it's

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,440
flexible if it's zero it's not you can

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,740
actually use other numbers but more on

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,120
that later and shrink is what if it's

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,310
too small

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,940
am i is a browser allowed to shrink it

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,820
more than the basis so basis is like the

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:21,150
where's based out of you know what's

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,880
default with sort of and it's actually

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,830
pretty flexible not all three are

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,250
required sometimes you usually just

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:32,610
specify one or two so you guys can check

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:35,790
out I'm posting a link later so if you

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:38,880
won t cheated this out there so you

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:41,700
could just define which once you really

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,610
need and in the real world probably look

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,840
like this so if you do something like a

00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:50,160
fixed type awhile ago

00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:52,980
it looks like zero zero and whatever the

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,650
height is and if you want an extendable

00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:00,600
it's just really Auto which is the same

00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:03,720
as one one auto and it's pretty much I

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,950
don't know I climbed to stop the server

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,210
now because it's really most of the

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,660
things you need to know but anyway let's

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,690
go on so if you want to space it out

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:16,290
something like this like evenly you can

00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:18,330
actually put margins around around each

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,250
item and they would be honored by flex

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,530
bug that's just gonna work like how you

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,320
usually would expect if you know like

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,900
you probably use margin:0 auto at some

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,740
point and that thing just kind of works

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:35,130
for vertical as well and if we go back

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,680
to the problem of vertical centering

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,500
it's you're not gonna believe that this

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,690
works but it does so that's just really

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,589
it and it gets pretty clean centered

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,040
sure thing

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:49,230
lovely so that's pretty much how you do

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,080
a vertical centering you just do a

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,680
margin on the item or the other way is

00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,180
you can also modify

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,370
container instead of the item to have

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,920
more control this is a property called

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:05,160
justified content there's actually more

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,270
possible values for this but the ones

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,880
you're probably going to be using the

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:12,180
most is space around which means even at

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,940
the spacing vertically and there's

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,820
pretty much two of them justified

00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:21,630
content is like vertical and a line

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:24,029
items is horizontal and that would also

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,110
get you a vertical Center and if you

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:27,240
notice this one you're styling a

00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:30,089
container and set it there instead of

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,610
the box instead of the item it's telling

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,500
a parent instead and that would be

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,550
enough to get you to a vertical

00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:41,610
centering just like that and essentially

00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,959
thing about this is it's actually right

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,660
now it kind of looks like how you would

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,700
expect tables to work or something but

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,220
the really interesting things happen is

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,740
what if you combined that with media

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,660
queries so what could how could you make

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,709
something that would work as well on a

00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:01,560
desktop and a tablet and a phone and the

00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:03,390
thing is since these are all just really

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,750
CSS properties and you could just

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:09,420
restyle them anytime you need to say put

00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,520
a media query for a tablet and just want

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,750
to change the Flex direction from column

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:18,000
which is to make things vertical to row

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,850
you just it's just really one little

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,580
property right there and that's really

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,430
perfect for things like you know when

00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,029
you're switching from tablet to mobile

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:32,490
and another thing is you could even

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:35,010
reorder things without changing the dump

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,470
order so you just go through that icon

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,779
just went from right to left and you

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,329
just really have to change order this

00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:44,190
little CSS property called order and you

00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,570
could just set an order for any one of

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,310
those property if any one of those

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,640
elements and you can just reorder them

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,500
depending on your media query so if you

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,910
put all these things together and you

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:59,040
just put a little media courier right

00:12:53,910 --> 00:13:01,860
here and basically it says that whenever

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,600
you're on a we're on a phone you're

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,760
going to make it vertical and you're

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,030
going to reorder the a bike

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:13,710
so in reap and practice this is what

00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:16,380
it's probably going to look like and

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:19,380
that's it you were able to make a menu

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:23,730
with very very little modifications to

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:26,790
your CSS and uh if anyone wants to

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:30,630
follow along this this example is

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:33,350
actually posted over at github and old

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:37,020
flat sheet paper URL later on and

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:40,410
basically this entire thing is built out

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:43,680
of flex box just really every just like

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,660
all the macro layout is all made out of

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,080
flex box and the fantastic thing is it's

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:52,320
you could also nest your flex boxes so

00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,480
you can have like three elements for

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,240
your main columns their main panes and

00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,630
that's just your regular flex box kind

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,610
of properties so this one is on 20% 80%

00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,380
of the other puts like min and Max with

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,410
just to make sure it doesn't collapse

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,080
too far and that's pretty much it you're

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,930
going to have like perfect columns on a

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,490
desktop but please by the way right if

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,900
anyone wants to follow along I tweeted

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:20,990
the link you can just check out my

00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:30,230
twitter and link is over there and and

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:30,230
so this is what it looks like play okay

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:39,230
so basically just do the same kinds of

00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:41,389
things wherein you take the take this

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,829
kinds of flexbox kind of properties and

00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,510
put a little media elements and just

00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:47,300
change the orientation from horizontal

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:55,760
to vertical and you just get a really

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:57,709
nice responsive almost effortlessly so

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,050
again it's just really all nested

00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:02,149
flexbox so this is how it probably would

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,070
look like under your typical app where

00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:06,980
you have like a horizontal kind of setup

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,880
and it would flatten out to a vertical

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,529
one whence you shrink your browser and

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,329
as you notice like you could just hide

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,519
one of the panes whenever you are in a

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:18,740
mobile just display knowing or some

00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,500
things and that would be fine and just

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,410
nest flex spots within a flex box

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,510
so even the things inside the delisting

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,300
is a flex bucks and a flex bucks

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:32,720
so the menu you saw that a while ago

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:35,329
though and that listing is actually

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,529
pretty simple just like that and then

00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:38,060
the pastor would probably do something

00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:40,760
like this in like position absolute

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,010
position fixed with like top left bottom

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,079
right and fixed pixels but now at least

00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,000
there's something more flexible and and

00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:49,250
the thing is you can the wonderful thing

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,890
here is if you want to add like say a

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,870
search bar or something just right under

00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,089
it it's pretty easy just insert another

00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,430
dumb element and put like another flex

00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:00,500
thing over there and that's it you could

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:05,390
you can pretty much change your eye up

00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:07,850
any time you want and if you notice this

00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:10,279
is actually it turns out to be something

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:13,010
that could actually work and here it is

00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,680
like I don't know like 40 additional

00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,839
lines of JavaScript so you make it kind

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,240
of do its thing and that's it we

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,069
actually we're able to make a pure CSS

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,310
approach to this whole responsive deal

00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:30,500
and there's no fancy JavaScript to like

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,329
what happens when you size it down you

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,480
need to hide this and that just pretty

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:37,010
much that and all that was able to be

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,880
accomplished with Flex box by the way

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:42,319
right here here is the Twitter and you

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,540
can just check out the link over there

00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:48,389
if you want to look at the source so

00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,420
trying to say is right now what temp cui

00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:53,009
layout problems it's pretty much solved

00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,100
when it comes to something that would be

00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:58,410
on mobile and it's something that really

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,410
makes you lets you integrate things

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,269
really really fast because if you really

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,030
want to rearrange things or just want to

00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:08,669
add and subtract and add you panels new

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:11,339
layouts you just really have to just add

00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:13,079
another element and flex buckles take

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,709
care of trying to lay that out for you

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:19,709
and if you try to go through like you

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:22,079
know different websites out there a

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:24,780
couple of them can be solved but flexbox

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,660
really so they're a couple of there's a

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:30,090
lot of scene in the properties he could

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,520
also use for flex bucks it like say for

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,929
example align cell flex and is something

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,679
you would probably use a set of

00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:40,440
float:right which while it goes pretty

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,440
much said that floats are evil so flex

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,169
logs is another way to get around it and

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,790
if you go to like content area it's

00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:50,330
pretty much the same kind of deal and

00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,730
you can even use a shorter flex box

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,470
syntax just flex 5 and flex 3 so

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,960
basically if you just specified the

00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,940
growth parameter it's kind of trying to

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,159
figure out which one's bigger and which

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,150
one smaller and you know based on each

00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:09,900
one's relative growth parameter and yeah

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:12,990
say this one - could be salt it's pretty

00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,690
much everything is just really a grit

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,490
everything is just a something that can

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,200
be solved with nested layouts and

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,840
fantastic thing is if you if you're able

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,179
to do it if you could implement like a

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,220
layout like slack over something like

00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:29,280
this it can be responsive down to tablet

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:34,350
so imagine like you could just say hide

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,450
the sidebar or no go to your under

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:39,480
sidebars to make sure that it could also

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,640
work in its head what so most of them

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,760
for the most part it's something that is

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,970
pretty much solved right now and if you

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,040
go to can I use comm the only thing that

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,179
really is slowing down the adoption of

00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,659
flex bucks right now

00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:56,850
is ie because the minimum thing the

00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:58,560
minimum version that really supports

00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:02,780
flex bucks for real as I

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:06,030
ie 11 so but as far as like the mobile

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,650
mobile adaptation even some of the older

00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,930
iPhones older androids are able to

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,490
support it so it's something that is

00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,360
actually pretty usable when it comes to

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,820
mobiles

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,770
so and if you're gonna do something like

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:21,840
mobile do I suggest you give it a try

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:26,330
and that's it for me so that's me Rico

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,330
and that was the lunch on flexbox

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:34,720
