Title: Joshua Koo: Cascading Perspectives with THREE CSS3DRenderer - CSSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2015-01-28
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	One of the interesting ways to create 3-dimensional content in browsers is by CSS 3D transforms. While three.js has been popularly known as the javascript library for webgl, its modular design supports rendering with 3D transforms using CSS and that has been nothing short of disappointing. This talk takes you through the history, the workings, the possibilities and the creativity (and possibly the future) of three.js and the CSS3DRenderer.

Joshua is random. Codes. Cycles. Climbs. Cold jokes. Organizes creative coding meetups. He uses .random() frequently in code and experiments on random ideas in his free time. At random moments, he gains inspiration to share and open source his works. Heâ€™s from Singapore and is employee #12 of Zopim (now Zendesk) where he leads the integration team.

hi guys and

00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,830
I

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,660
nice to be here myself and my colleagues

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:41,110
has been coming for the past three years

00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:48,269
so it's nice to be back so let's see all

00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:53,739
right so this again hello CSS huh and

00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:56,260
everything is done in CSS 3d well a bit

00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:58,980
of like a floating debris is if I don't

00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:04,239
know if you like gravity or best era

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:09,840
alright alright so my top today the up

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:15,100
line will be talking about Tubba pjs why

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:18,190
this talk is about CSS 3d renderer and a

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:22,000
bit of history like you know what we're

00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:23,979
behind the scenes as a developer and you

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,429
know a bit of what goes under the hood

00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:29,440
in this renderer no Bo you know what

00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:35,259
what's gonna happen next are we going to

00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:37,780
use this stuff a day so three dot CSS 3

00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:42,819
dot CSS 3d render that's the convention

00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:45,429
that we use for the 3gs library but

00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:47,380
first you will say what you know why are

00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:54,369
we talking about a GS like real Tecna

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:56,440
CSS conference and in fact it's probably

00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:58,869
not you know maybe talk about three

00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:02,440
years many people you know this uh Bobby

00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:05,080
says that the JavaScript library for

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,979
back via I mean you could look at es

00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,810
it's only a josh a backyard library or

00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,590
you could think that art is the best

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:20,110
javascript library for free jet you know

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:23,590
hopefully it later and and and so so one

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:27,780
thing for that is that great things

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:30,360
doesn't belong alone it's

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,709
cut juice which is the nickname my

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:38,190
colleagues give me and maybe we'll go

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,770
mon Dieu why you know what good things

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,030
doesn't have to be you know what doesn't

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:51,140
have to be alone or why I things alone

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:55,739
so BR 3gs is a JavaScript library and

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:59,310
it's hosted on github what number of

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:04,230
contributors and you can see quite a bit

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:08,600
of following and in a guy behind that

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:13,050
Ricardo otherwise known as mr. bill it's

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:17,850
started this project so a bit of 3gs

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:20,250
like it's a rendering engine and you use

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,959
that to render scene so there's only

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,519
four things that you need first it is a

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:28,709
sin second is objects objects can be

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:34,200
measures you know 3d models materials

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:37,049
light a grouping of 3d objects and Telus

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,900
camera where since this is a budget

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:45,540
releasing you want to do have a camera

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,640
to capture like what the camera sees and

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,650
you have perspective and photographic

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,510
perspective is what is what your eye

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,760
sees like as things goes out how this

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,880
goes down the road you know the houses

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,890
appear smaller orthography is like when

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,620
you use it like for some autographic

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,200
drawings like the same objects of the

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,290
same size appear to be the same length

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:15,150
when it's maybe on paper or on your

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:18,660
screen and lastly spread the road and so

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,930
is sorry you can see that this really

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,930
you know not just better in the room yes

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,630
chemist renderer bacteria SVG software

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:31,040
renderer I will not go so much into it

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:35,750
but the idea is that 3gs is a web

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:39,110
you know JavaScript rendering engine

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,560
where you could basically say that you

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,440
know you have a senior objects you could

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,690
use a perspective camera camera

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:52,580
orthographic camera and likewise the

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:54,890
renderer kinda modular you know you

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:58,160
could play a chemist renderer for web we

00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:01,190
are in durham and how much renderer has

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,050
been more popular or the past years

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:08,740
because back we are is not be supported

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:11,990
like on many platforms but like with iOS

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:15,020
8 we have mobile devices running back

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:22,150
here so in a new releases of 3gs like

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:24,740
bacteria is the default 3gs renderer so

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,040
it's how you do it in code where you

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:32,060
have a scene you know you're right noon

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:35,830
same camera a new perspective camera and

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,990
render oh yeah new babe gia render and

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:42,260
you add objects fiber objects to the

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:47,060
scene and the car ended up render the

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:50,990
scene and camera passing so nice thing

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:55,790
about the CSS video and array is that it

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:59,150
works like almost aware you will see for

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:02,230
a WebGL see a second set of a new tree

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:09,350
German Darrell you would actually use

00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:13,760
CSS 3d render and you do the same which

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:16,720
is you include a 3gs library you include

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,860
the CSS 3d render JavaScript farm

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,790
because it does not come with the

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:25,790
default view is this is in a sauce in

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:29,660
the github repository and you create Dom

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,090
elements a basic back then in 3d objects

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,510
and

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,330
3ds 3ds practice and then they see and

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:40,229
then you could have any made Emma

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:43,139
interactivity so as I mentioned if you

00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:46,050
wrap them in 3d objects are 3d sprites

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:54,240
so basically you can just create a Dom

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:58,380
element and and basically the difference

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,229
is that a 3d object kind of has a

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:05,130
perspective like when you rotate it if

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:07,860
you say it's like a paper being rotated

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:10,440
in 3d space while at release flag is

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,360
like a beer bar which faces you all the

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,360
time that is the one in the middle

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:25,080
alright so I mean why will you use a CSS

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:29,510
3d render night you know yeah WebGL is

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:34,110
gaining popularity you know it runs on

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:39,350
iOS and no longer problem IE 11 runs

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:42,660
bactria so why CSS 3d so what a benefit

00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,770
which I wish I think it is really great

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:49,110
about this is that it's really

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:53,340
lightweight in fact if you if you take

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:55,290
all the things that just this to render

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:59,160
to leave your package the library for

00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:02,490
with the CSS 3d render without bacteria

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:07,310
or canvas is probably before GZ is a

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:12,930
rocky Cavey so it's very small you know

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:17,010
not not a concern right the default I

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:20,130
think the back job you is about 200 200

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,320
kb so matter benefits like if you are

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:25,800
used if you are web developer and you

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,990
you are used to having Dom elements so

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,440
this is really great like instead of

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:34,800
missing a vector in a standard flow you

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,830
have to create a 3d models like some

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:42,570
form of a geometry and then you have to

00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:45,030
create materials say a basic material

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:51,030
you know if a flat shading or you could

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:52,470
have a look lumber shading so so you

00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,800
have to put lights in there and

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:59,130
calculate what how smooth shading or is

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,040
it flexion in that unit but policy for

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:06,389
CSS 3d render is this just an amazing

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:10,500
elements so no Shay does no material no

00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:13,740
measures which really simple and so that

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,440
the things they are animating is yes CSS

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,180
sub which is because the star in

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,639
whatever ways in life I'd like to put a

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:24,149
curve radius model to it you could do it

00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,350
and when you have all these objects

00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:28,920
which are any way through you could

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:34,139
actually a Dom events Angela right we're

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:37,800
going to mouse over mouse click well in

00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:40,380
a typical web jockey mesh renderer the

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,290
browser vendors to a canvas which is

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:46,259
basically and what you get is you do a

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:50,190
mouse move you get have get academics

00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:52,649
and you have to do a kick to find back

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:59,339
what object you actually the cursor is

00:09:52,649 --> 00:10:04,589
on this mobile friendly it runs on quite

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:10,399
many mobile devices and draw iOS and

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:14,850
it's pretty performer so then this year

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:17,959
John Brown he actually gave a talk scss

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:23,490
comfy you on his experience working

00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:26,910
using the CSS 3d render with for

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:30,300
projects for google like for example the

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:36,060
showcase a website of google.com / our

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:37,740
own so it is a recommended top and if

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:45,000
you have done you know grammar check

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:47,970
data and slice of history probably too

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,410
small to read but there I'll just go

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:56,610
ahead does that explain so I mean if you

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:58,450
watch iron man you will see that is

00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,440
navigating some

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,440
using the faces

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:24,279
right and oops

00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:24,279
love it

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,230
and

00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:39,470
and the story goes that famous actually

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:44,080
wrote the library to have to be able to

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:48,440
do like obvious render on your iPad and

00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:52,790
so they so there is the famous library

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:56,180
for deck and Ricardo stud good kind of

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,980
black sea okay you know my snake is not

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,670
to say it's not back yeah it's not

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:06,410
converse so what lies that he has to be

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:12,400
CSS 3d and and so mr. Duke did this

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:12,400
experiment himself there you have it

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,980
and rotate it

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,390
so I this is in CSS 3d

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,950
all right yeah i mean this this is a

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:48,300
screen shot of you know of this i'm

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:51,960
running an ipad suddenly say okay great

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:54,540
but how does it work and the thing

00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,899
behind this is 3d transforms yes

00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,839
actually transforms and let's let me

00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:03,500
just do a quick demo and so this another

00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:09,779
example which comes in a previous

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:14,160
examples in and you can see this is

00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:20,370
basically rendering a panoramic view in

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:23,459
a in a sky box and if we take if we

00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:25,260
inspect the element you can see these

00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:32,270
are all bound elements it's basically

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,270
image and if you so less this

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,190
Cilic

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,860
and you can see that the matrices are

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:49,460
changing so this is how CSS 3d render it

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:52,250
works maybe a big too complex and and so

00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:56,270
I will do try a bit of light coating so

00:13:52,250 --> 00:14:01,010
this is basically that's a relief in a

00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:08,630
really simple HTML file let's just hit

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:11,770
the body and the d200 fix str Crixus so

00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,770
let's use them

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,890
fun and let's try skill

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:35,230
x

00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:39,939
and see that it changes may be less the

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:42,399
area fine with the step transition yeah

00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:44,860
not recommended to use off a performer

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:50,199
results back you know for laziness I

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:54,600
will just do that is in and if I play

00:14:50,199 --> 00:15:01,059
around this number can see that it moves

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:08,709
okay so now we let's try rotate and we

00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:12,790
try wrap it say z 5 degrees maybe a bit

00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:18,819
more for some defect and okay rotate Z

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:21,389
words and now let's try rotate y orata

00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:21,389
types

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:28,350
and it's kind of strange like nothing's

00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:30,570
happening so so why why is this

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,120
happening so what you have to do is that

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:38,520
you have to go to parent element and add

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:42,230
a perspective number and there you have

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,230
it it gets

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:53,140
and you see that the mattresses that

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:56,050
you've seen before in in in the previous

00:15:53,140 --> 00:16:03,000
example so you could you could do like

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:06,760
metrics and then you four five six

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,560
arguments this is shocking for that more

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,560
arguments for metrics 3d

00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:36,290
so this can control the skill and this

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:39,800
controls like the translation yeah

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:43,220
matrix is kind of scary like you know I

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,830
I did not like of these mathematics and

00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:51,200
do when I start playing this and it's

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:54,200
actually not too difficult yeah this is

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:58,490
the documentation mvn like matrix what

00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:02,990
parameters to use and if you like to

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:06,020
learn more about matrices Steven videos

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:08,090
as has a good time making back job dance

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,430
where you have like explains how

00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:13,940
mattresses work it's basically a matrix

00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:17,930
content rotation skill and translation

00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:20,270
in the concise way and this is what the

00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:23,990
CSS 3d render is doing it applies it to

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:26,480
the to the Dom element so that you don't

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:32,120
have to do likes qxu across the x and

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:36,680
that becomes really lengthy so what are

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,900
the limitations why you know in what

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:44,090
ways the CSS Philly when the right isn't

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:47,840
that good so first browser but this was

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:51,800
this was brought up in John Brown's talk

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,590
to when I does not support physically so

00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:57,260
physically this basically if you have a

00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:00,710
3d object in a 2d object and you

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:04,600
basically users have to it maintains

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:07,580
like a coordinates in a child object and

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,700
and without that you can just add

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:14,180
objects and objects and we retain the

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:18,740
perspective so there are solutions where

00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:21,920
is 3d render I and an intersection

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:25,220
problems like chrome may not be able to

00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:28,050
render it went to dislike intersect and

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:33,030
may not have shows the

00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:34,790
the dead properly so next restoration so

00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:39,420
what happens behind the scene is that

00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:44,460
when you use this seed transforms is

00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:46,560
dead it gets sense to the GPU so GPU is

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,510
to simply say that it's a piece of

00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,750
hardware which does graphics and

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,340
actually does it it's much more

00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,870
efficient to do it on the hardware and

00:18:53,340 --> 00:19:04,730
do it in software and and so this is

00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:09,450
about I did have immediate metrics and

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:12,260
oh and what I wonder demonstrate is that

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,260
if you zoom in

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:21,770
you can see that it is capitulated so

00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:26,570
this is restoration like if you it's not

00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:28,970
like in in if you have a plane in

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,010
bacteria and zoomy you can to see that

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,600
that's a straight line but over here

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,659
when you don't mean that you can see

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:39,440
that it gets accelerated it's not not

00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:43,760
really a big problem okay let's just lay

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:47,059
around this let's go on you can ask you

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,419
it so when you wrap text if you create a

00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:53,690
text element you could have sizing up to

00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:58,490
maybe hire fixes and then you get chris

00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:07,309
years and the next thing is lei Li me so

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:11,090
I was basic X experimenting and and and

00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:15,470
and we had so mr. dilip at this

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:17,990
experiment which wich years ago used to

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:21,559
run performance and when I tried out

00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:24,500
like that this is in 2012 and it was a

00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:26,809
trending one frame per second and so

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:31,909
what possibly change over the years is

00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:34,240
the way the browser renders the web page

00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:34,240
and

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,370
so this was the experiment which I was

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:54,120
playing with which was kind of like

00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:56,250
clone of his experiment and enter the

00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:02,399
dead of view is basically i'm applying a

00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:07,289
CSS blur filter three have limited that

00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:14,190
objects are leather lab lab okay in in

00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:17,909
photography so I thought this was is

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:21,659
origin expert experiment and and most

00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:24,179
interesting that this was done it's not

00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:26,879
with CSS render it was delivered on

00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:29,129
renderer so when I went ham Louis

00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:31,409
experimenting but we know wise this is

00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:35,700
no it's not serious it's not canvas is

00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:37,409
not baptized CSS 3d render so I was

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,139
starting to dig up the history of like

00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:44,990
how creatures evolved which was

00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:44,990
basically used to bring the Dom elements

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:57,039
and so some other tests I did which was

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:59,740
like and slowly a like kappa i read

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,630
elements and when i hit a thousand we

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:06,610
see the frames per second should drop to

00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:09,220
about 10 frames a second so what happens

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:14,950
is that there's a limit to how many

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:18,280
layers that you could that you could

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:20,020
actually enemy if the cssp director but

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,270
my place is there every time you use a

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,880
trance electronique you know the

00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:30,940
translate the heck you are creating a

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:33,820
layer and that layer becomes is supposed

00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,650
to be accelerator and and i say the

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:41,640
browser composite that we have to put

00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:45,850
them together so sao paulo is who is a

00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:48,039
developer ok for huger has this article

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,770
saying bye bye Lea hex like hell of your

00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:53,679
chains so I don't like you know we have

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,240
found it translate Z is pretty good like

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,150
you know you mix things and it made much

00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,580
faster if you abuse this feature you

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,679
know and you hit like a thousand objects

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:06,610
of this your web page is going to slow

00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:09,039
down like really badly and he has a

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:12,820
really that occur visa you're making

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:15,130
layers is considered dangerous so but as

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,159
long as you know like what Adam is our I

00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:20,650
think it's good to know like how the

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,159
browser is rendering and and so you

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:26,830
would not you know does not apply

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,610
translate Z on everything and now it

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:32,980
means this closet browser to hang so

00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:37,659
what question is can CSS 3d render on

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:41,169
regular matches like you know like with

00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:43,179
the other renderers triggers so this was

00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:47,110
an ax prime I wish I did basically

00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:49,630
turning a huger object your ambassador

00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:50,820
that the CSS 3d render doesn't use

00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,019
geometry

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:58,259
but if it take the user geometry items

00:23:54,019 --> 00:24:00,960
in this case is here I could have

00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:03,630
translated back into the be rendered

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:09,269
with CSS 3d so my place is the heavy

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:11,730
line here is messages a dominant and now

00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:16,200
it is interesting article suspect as a

00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:22,460
stack overflow and some vast language is

00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:26,450
one big contributors his reactive 3gs

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:30,419
community lab you know helping before

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:32,580
and this capsule max bhangra you know

00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:35,399
but his it's pretty interesting like you

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,889
know how different people me without a

00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:39,809
graphics background we you know we come

00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:43,169
together and there's so many interesting

00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:49,019
things that come from this 3gs ecosystem

00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:53,070
so you got twitter app i think this was

00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:56,340
this year are pushing the limits so this

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,789
was its approach to render for branding

00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,789
measures

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,460
the vicious

00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,860
30 New York you can always fight this

00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:29,400
back with google yeah so this is the

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:34,490
classic flocking the butt system

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,490
in three years but so in CSS reading

00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,960
that leaves around a place

00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:58,080
and

00:25:53,850 --> 00:26:02,910
performance so not only random Mexico

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:06,080
actually emulate the kind of lacking you

00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:06,080
have in WebGL

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,490
and

00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,820
and what what the more complex is on

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:20,390
purse like giving your friend doing is

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:29,810
the support animation we see them that

00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:32,090
is how is this possible all right so so

00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:34,330
this is another example CSS 3d render me

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,330
use

00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:57,559
and so this link is locked we're

00:26:50,899 --> 00:27:03,730
actually find it you could you have a

00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:03,730
editor you can actually create stuff

00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:16,630
but apart from these like kind of random

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,390
measures we BBC text is hitting the

00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,130
limits like it runs like animate the

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:23,740
house reference per second so the

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:27,340
question is is this I know you know the

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:29,940
CSS 3d render so my partner is

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:36,940
impractical like you know it's used in

00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:39,309
the google i/o showcase this other

00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,289
experiments which like the following

00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:43,600
link shows how you could use WebGL

00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:46,330
together CSS 3d render because bacteria

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,490
as a support rendering text of the box

00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:51,909
so you put actually basically just use

00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:54,100
text in your Dom elements and and

00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:59,400
because it makes perfectly I come back

00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:04,539
we are the CSS you can actually like

00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:07,090
have a great neighbors with that more

00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:10,240
demos don't I think we might not have

00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,970
time for this let the experiment for

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:19,059
Christmas and I share add some by

00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:23,470
imaging so okay so I think I'll

00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:25,990
summer-like 3gs isn't just know it's

00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:28,539
really popular for back pure it isn't

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:30,340
just like there and sometimes we don't

00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:33,280
have to think like no should we use this

00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,230
or use that is it better sometimes it

00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,169
could be compliments and ideas

00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:41,289
unrestricted platforms like ideas in a

00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:43,630
VFX industry you know is what I would

00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:48,039
like to see in Vietnam graphics on the

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:51,929
browser's you know ideas which famous

00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:55,780
has could be used in three years and and

00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:57,700
the simplicity of this renderer he has a

00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,280
special place in here though you know

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:03,559
these days I and I see I love doing back

00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:07,279
now and so I

00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:11,330
the animal top thank you that's my treat

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:21,259
ahead wow I always love the demos please

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:24,019
huge applause for that could you please

00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:25,759
elaborate on how the shading of the

00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:33,950
polygons worth like for example the

00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:37,070
horse okay so for that it's that uses a

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:41,570
slightly cheaper version of the CSS 3d

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:44,330
render that kind of like it does needs

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,549
to cut calculate like its shading so

00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,490
basically picked up the face normals and

00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:53,960
there is your classic computer graphics

00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:56,659
and of algorithms like you take the

00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,149
normal and the direction of the light

00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:03,559
and you kind of let me do a dot vector I

00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:06,080
mean sorry a dot a dot product and you

00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:08,210
can find it you know how much like you

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,169
know how how bright you perceive get to

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:14,480
be so that is done in JavaScript and

00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:18,499
then you have like this modify the color

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:22,159
of the domina moon if you actually ever

00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:28,610
used 3d CSS in a normal website to use

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:30,499
that that's open some way no yeah yeah i

00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:34,090
mean i have if you go to the j s comp

00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:36,950
website uses a lot of 3d translations I

00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,440
try to make use of it somehow I'm sure

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,629
there will be more uses in the future

00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,389
how to use 3d CSS to actually give more

00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:46,190
personality to websites in normal web

00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:48,350
sites like every day shopping website

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,899
could use 3d CSS because all that stuff

00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:54,259
doesn't just works in your browser right

00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:54,790
so thanks again applause for joshua i

00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:56,850
think

00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,850
