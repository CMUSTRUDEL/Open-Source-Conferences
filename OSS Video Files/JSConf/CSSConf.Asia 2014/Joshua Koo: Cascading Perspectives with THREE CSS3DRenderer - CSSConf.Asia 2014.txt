Title: Joshua Koo: Cascading Perspectives with THREE CSS3DRenderer - CSSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2015-01-28
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	One of the interesting ways to create 3-dimensional content in browsers is by CSS 3D transforms. While three.js has been popularly known as the javascript library for webgl, its modular design supports rendering with 3D transforms using CSS and that has been nothing short of disappointing. This talk takes you through the history, the workings, the possibilities and the creativity (and possibly the future) of three.js and the CSS3DRenderer.

Joshua is random. Codes. Cycles. Climbs. Cold jokes. Organizes creative coding meetups. He uses .random() frequently in code and experiments on random ideas in his free time. At random moments, he gains inspiration to share and open source his works. Heâ€™s from Singapore and is employee #12 of Zopim (now Zendesk) where he leads the integration team.
