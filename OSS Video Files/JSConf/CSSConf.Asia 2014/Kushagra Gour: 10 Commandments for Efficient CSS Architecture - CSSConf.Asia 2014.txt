Title: Kushagra Gour: 10 Commandments for Efficient CSS Architecture - CSSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2015-02-05
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	CSS is a very funny language. That is something we all have realised at some point or the other while working with it. If not used correctly, a language used to make things look good can itself start looking bad and we can end up with CSS that is hard to manage and extend. My talk will be about 10 things which I have learnt from experience can make oneâ€™s CSS manageable and easy to extend, specially in large scale applications. Plus there is a fun CSS game for everyone to play along during the talk! Lets have fun with CSS together.

Kushagra is a front-end developer on VWO, a Wingify product, a CSS freak and author of Hint.css. He likes to create things that use existing concepts in new ways. Also sometimes called as the PJ king (beware!), he likes to beatbox and doodle sketches in spare time.
