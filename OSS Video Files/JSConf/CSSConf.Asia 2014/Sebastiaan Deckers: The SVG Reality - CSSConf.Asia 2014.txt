Title: Sebastiaan Deckers: The SVG Reality - CSSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2015-01-17
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	SVG is weird. It looks somehow familiar and can be handled similarly but it has its distinct differences and purpose from the technologies you know, like HTML and CSS. In this talk I want to share my experiences getting started, embedding and using SVG in modern web applications.

Seb is a frontend fanatic hailing from Belgium. He now lives in Singapore where he helps startups build browser-whipping web apps at Cofounders.sg and hosts the Front End Developers Singapore (FEDS) meetup.

CSSConf.Asia - Bridging Design and Implementation. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 19 November 2014.

hey yes I want to talk about SVG reality

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:27,359
and I might be a famous sculptor but

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll make it entertaining so I want to

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,399
talk about this problem and some of you

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,739
orbit over like myself would remember

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,960
that the web needs to be 1024 and

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,570
everyone was just doing 1024 big

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,180
question was do you do 60 pixels wide

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:49,110
I'm evening maybe a thousand if you're

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:51,090
like 960 there you go just like so but

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,920
sort of things have changed a lot we've

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,620
gone from desktop computers with CRT

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,379
monitors it's all up with the same

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,350
number pixels to what is going on with

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,090
these fixes devices have caught totally

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,110
crazy we've got every synchro leaf

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,750
resolution imagine not only that pixels

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:14,490
have now gone crazy and have more

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,409
pictures in them however that works so I

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,820
think I think I think we've better

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:23,189
excuse better languages and I think what

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,650
we really have have to work with is

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,049
something that fits these new

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,170
technologies we need to software

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:35,030
languages that fit the hardware that we

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,689
create we need something I can adapt

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:40,110
another thing that we've come up with

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:44,820
like I said it's high DPI so that means

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:48,530
we've got more than one device pixel for

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,549
CSS pixel or pro logical fix and

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,530
suddenly all of our assets that are

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,590
meant to look beautiful and I resolution

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,829
suddenly look not so high resolution

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,659
anymore you know they're the same assets

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,290
somehow people have sort of gotten used

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,180
to expecting super crisp text and if you

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,770
have some good sex why you picked your

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,760
column at sharp sure you can just beam

00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,989
massive assets down I is

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,439
group allemagne that you're going to use

00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:21,610
or or falls to do but it's not very

00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:25,989
sustainable and it's not really

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,340
necessary for a lot of use cases I think

00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:32,530
it's better than the format that

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:34,540
stretches and when you think of that we

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,780
have had these formats for a long long

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:40,209
time we've you know we've thankfully got

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:44,560
rid of flash which was kind of like that

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:49,150
but not really the best tool to God for

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,760
a wreath we've had things like SVG for

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,319
what a lot now CSS also has a lot of

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,970
ways to do that see there's a lot of it

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,739
has a lot of ways and here's here's one

00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:01,139
cycle one good leg off you're a lot of

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:04,680
genomic which turns a single live into

00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:08,310
any icon using a variety because hacks

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,900
using 2d elements and a lot of order

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,060
order drinks background tricks gradients

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,739
all over the place but I think that's

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,359
pretty much thing I don't think we just

00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,889
go like that I think it's really cool to

00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:20,079
be clever enough to come up with those

00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:22,829
things but we should not be using that

00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:25,299
it's not good software engineering I

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:29,739
feel like we're kind of those we're by

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:30,970
doing roof / CSS if you're familiar with

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,040
that it's the concept of having an

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,480
extremely fragile machine that does

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,099
something really intricate it's

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,180
completely unmaintained a bowl put it

00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,799
looks pretty sweet it's very

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:43,510
entertaining it makes jewelry smart when

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:48,250
you like put it all together but it's

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:50,680
crazy right so instead of that what do

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,480
you something like as fini scalable

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,209
vector graphics that are pretty much

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,810
designed to solve this problem and have

00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,159
done so for a decade now for more but we

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,159
haven't really been using them pretty

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:07,199
well at least I am so I want to share a

00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:09,639
little bit of what I've discovered and

00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:15,940
another look at them in the last year or

00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:18,970
so adding a sticky as a it's one to one

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,680
standard that's extremely huge and

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,090
everyone sort of underestimates it I

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,490
think you can do a lot of things that

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,099
people

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,539
expect and I think going forward with

00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:29,210
sort of where the future from the

00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:31,910
development is heading you think of what

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,800
components anything goes in your icons

00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,680
route 60 the modularization other

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,849
applications are going on your bill

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,169
think of the few thing you know the

00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:42,849
current awesome stuff that we have in

00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:46,300
css3 and versus a subtle for others

00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:48,949
wherever all that's going I think SVG is

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,509
ideally placed to take advantage of all

00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:54,770
of that and become a core part of our

00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:56,569
application architecture so we're going

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,880
to be quoting SVG just like we are

00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:00,139
putting CSS today which is something up

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,050
give me 10 years ago we wouldn't have

00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,550
thought that was more time to do because

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,130
we were doing everything indication on

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,349
JavaScript and then serve javis can win

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,150
and became totally crazy huge awesome

00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:12,979
but it's actually very simple language

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,310
compared to something like a CG which

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:18,530
supports a lot lot more it's kind of

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,380
like html5 together with the big swap I

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,699
suspect your schoolwork was really small

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:27,020
SPG something something like that except

00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:31,729
even more and I don't think we can cover

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:34,250
a nearly the entire standard today but I

00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:37,630
want to just introduce you and tell you

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,039
guys that that this is an amazing

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:43,719
technology that's available a lot of

00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:47,389
browsers and you think think about it

00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:51,139
it's not my intention to talk too much

00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:53,030
about the browser support because I

00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,889
think almost everything to look at it's

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,560
going to be broken in some browsers and

00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:00,650
that's kind of flying in a world right

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,419
here because we focus on the future the

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,250
but the lessons we learned here from all

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,319
the amazing speakers today are things

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,389
that are going to matter to us for years

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,120
to come so I don't want to focus on

00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:12,319
legacy support I think most of the stuff

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,569
that even isn't working right now

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,270
rogersville options for it either

00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:19,009
already available or coming out soon to

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,569
sort of let us play with it and see

00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:27,349
where this is all head so I want to get

00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:30,199
away from this which to me is how I sort

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:33,380
of wanted to present that Nia that this

00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,180
Tiger is SVG as it was 10 or more years

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,199
ago I've seen this

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:43,009
picture again and again again and I want

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,169
to get away from this pointless use of

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:48,370
SVG and to something like help us build

00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:52,580
applications and be cool like the

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:55,970
colonist so Who am I my name is

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,289
Sebastian I'm front-end developer i live

00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,840
in florida queer kind of comfortable

00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:02,300
co-founders a lot of startups and I'm

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,520
just basically good friend following all

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,880
the time we're not a number of projects

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:11,479
on board with all that so without

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,620
further ado let us talk about some of

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,590
the community stuff that we have here as

00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,110
well someone actually probably this

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,030
figure to take a lot of mess of people

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,389
here president right now this was a few

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,530
days ago there's a bit really vibrant

00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,389
community of front of developers in

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:30,169
Singapore and I just wanted a sort of

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,550
share that I think it's amazing the way

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:35,270
that developers have sort of gotten

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,820
together in Singapore across all hot for

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,530
all languages there's as you can see

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,409
with the fs there's something to be a

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,180
point here every single day there's

00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:46,250
something for everyone really it's just

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,349
every single year I've been here for

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,520
years every single you're pretty much

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:52,190
doubles in science I think it's

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:59,120
wonderful and I look forward to all

00:07:52,190 --> 00:08:03,590
future guess cops and super so if we can

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,449
look at scg coming from you know red CSS

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,750
com we're all trying to develop it

00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:12,380
almost it was a primary developers it's

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:15,740
actually very similar in what we used to

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,449
so I don't think you can see that so

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,690
basically it supports you know like

00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:22,729
device independent pixels animations

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,340
hardware acceleration you know very

00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:27,800
proud to support but some amazing

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,479
performance is possible blending modes

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,009
are really interesting there in my hat

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,860
you might have used some lightning ones

00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:36,200
at CSS but they're kind of there it's

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,440
basically what lets us do photoshop kind

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,829
of effects with layers between HTML

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,810
elements or SVG elements you know you

00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:46,329
can make it responsive you can use your

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,850
luck inspector

00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:52,839
where there are tools to deploy the

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:55,600
things it's very very easy to do you've

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,839
got no filters it has a dog maybe I just

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,319
like you're really stew with the HTML so

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:05,259
it makes it very powerful to build on

00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:08,439
top of it using logic to create elements

00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:09,970
to drive changes there's a lot of

00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:12,489
libraries that basically built on top of

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,079
that make it very easy it's got

00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:17,189
scripting you'd embed it so not only can

00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:20,040
you access doing your SVG structures

00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:24,129
with scripts with external scripts and

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,079
manipulate the Dom the SPG's can

00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:28,839
actually that's between elements or

00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:30,639
documents also contain Java can also

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:36,100
contain embed JavaScript just like an

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:38,980
HTML page or an HTML document would that

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,049
has certain security implications for

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,720
example would you allow javascript to

00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:45,489
run an SVG icon on your desktop no of

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,660
course not it's there's certain places

00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:48,939
where you can run it certain places

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,410
where you cannot as things like color

00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:51,699
profiles which you notes there's it's

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,329
sort of a nice feature but like for

00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:56,619
people to print it's really important on

00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:58,239
the web it's sort of are probably going

00:09:56,619 --> 00:10:00,579
to become more important once we get to

00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:04,360
things like high dynamic range displays

00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:06,429
in the coming years now how do you use

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,249
SVG's well I think a lot of you have

00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:11,589
probably seen some of the common usage

00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:14,079
patterns just you know replacing a ping

00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:16,089
file with a good an SPG things like that

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,829
so let me run through some of the main

00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:21,369
and is it visit not all of them there's

00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:23,049
actually an incredible variety of ways

00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:26,619
to use SVG so I'm going to run through

00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:30,160
some of the main ones one of my favorite

00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:33,249
ones is the html5 you know native

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,929
support for the SVG element you don't

00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:37,569
have to do anything for it just open an

00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:40,569
element SVG and you can drop any kind of

00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:43,569
SVG elements within that any kind of

00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:45,339
shapes I can get really complicated of

00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:47,949
course but do simple things with that in

00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:49,360
your daily development if you need to

00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:51,639
draw a line between something you don't

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,559
have through hacks with Porter borders

00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,990
and all that kind of stuff you can just

00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:58,869
draw a line and that's big deal it takes

00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,710
very little code to do that you no

00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:01,060
longer have to worry about

00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,940
namespaces and all these kind of things

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:06,640
and you know it renders beautifully it's

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,380
high performance it's cleaner code you

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,700
can read the code and it means that

00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,490
there's an actual line there is no

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,530
longer like somehow a div with a border

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,440
bottom somewhere else define in CSS file

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:19,900
it's very clean it works really well in

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,160
large-scale applications and I've really

00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:26,320
been using that a lot lately so another

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,140
way to do it that probably more people

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,070
are familiar with right now is uh just

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,600
loading in a URL function in CSS and

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,990
these can be used in a lot of places

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,220
like background images obviously this

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,040
style in which is those little those

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,750
little glyphs in front of the you know I

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,330
could've ordered lists out of us for an

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:50,050
unordered list things like the border

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:52,620
image that's a something that you can do

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,600
some neat tricks with it's not the most

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,170
high-performance most browsers but it

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,730
works Purser's sort of flaky support

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,020
right now but again not really concerned

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:06,430
with that and content you know like for

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,040
your sooo elements like your before and

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:14,290
after you can draw images within them

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,520
which is kind of it SVG fonts probably

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,950
most of you have heard of them or seen

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,730
them whenever you copy paste that you

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,110
know that some custom font from like

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,600
font awesome or whatever service that

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:31,720
you use as many fonts are sort of

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,910
deprecated but it looks like and this is

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,110
just looking on mailing lists and

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:41,890
discussions there's a lot of interest in

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:43,300
multicolor fonts I thought it was a bit

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,360
weird at first which I which we call the

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,560
court once but then you know emoji

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,050
everybody loves sending emoji emoticons

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,920
and those have readings those have

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,750
shadows there's a lot of colors and

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,980
there's competing standards right now so

00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:01,660
SVG's possibly making a comeback in

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,700
fonts there's a lot of support in next

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,820
15 spot elements dedicated to you know

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,950
fonts and like structuring upon in SVG

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,320
and most of those are right now sort of

00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,860
like brushed aside but they might come

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,910
back and

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,800
when they do we'll have things like

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,260
colorful fonts we'll have the fonts

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,870
gradients within a single glyphs will

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:23,560
have shadows without you know it will be

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:27,579
beautiful scalable moved the world will

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,350
be possible so that's sort of something

00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:31,810
that right now I you know probably

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:35,529
shouldn't be using but in a couple of

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:37,810
years who knows another way to use them

00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:41,800
right now which is it's actually really

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:43,720
cool it's a better way to do sprites so

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,839
if you're doing if you're combining a

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,540
lot of small images into a larger image

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,220
then you know it you have to set up

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,320
another book build stab all these kind

00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,120
of stuff and you have to deal with

00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,829
change in core minutes and stuff and

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,800
things like that it gets a little bit

00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:01,540
unwieldy sometimes it's it's a really

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,510
really nice way to do it is to just

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,910
stack all of them in a single SVG and

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,110
you can also you can again use a bill a

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,339
bill stepp for that but it but i'm

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,130
really used to actually manage that

00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:18,640
within your your your SVG editors like

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:22,390
illustrator or inkscape and the way to

00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,730
reference them is by just using a URL

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,519
like like like these two here the first

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:31,060
one is how you actually reference SVG

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:34,390
fragments inside your SVG files so if

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:37,570
you're embedding in line SPG in your

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:40,209
document you can use the use element

00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,970
with a this x-linked hrh reference it's

00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:44,820
not the produce language words you can

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:49,000
reference your file and then do a

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:51,339
fragment identifier in the URL and that

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,500
will pull up the ID like the element

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,829
with the ID that you specify like

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,750
in this case it will pull up the fox

00:14:55,829 --> 00:15:02,339
element and render only that it won't

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:04,480
render anything else so you can have 100

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:08,470
icons in there and it will just pick up

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,589
that single that's single I element it's

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,449
a really nice way to do sort of icon

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:17,649
sheets for icon stacks or whatever II

00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:20,380
call them it also works and image source

00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:22,000
in your regular HTML so in this case i

00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,589
would pick the same file but pick a

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,690
different element and i would not see

00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,230
the box and

00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,690
rather than the other one I think it

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:34,350
also works in the background image sorry

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,540
I didn't check that right now so let's

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,400
let's have a quick look em I'm sure you

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,070
know probably some of you have already

00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,840
seen you know what SVG looks like what I

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,180
can do with it the basic level so i'll

00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,180
just quickly skip through this so the

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,380
basic building blocks of ice cream are

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,850
really you know i could CSS you have

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,210
your units they're actually exactly the

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,680
same in fact SVG specification says you

00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,780
know our units are basically the same

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,520
ones as define its users 2.1 the old

00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,950
stuff so but it hasn't really changed

00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,950
that much good three anyway and i'm

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,570
talking about cious SVG 1.1 which is

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:12,230
pretty old but it's it's sort of what

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:14,880
everyone uses today the basic shapes are

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,740
sort of simple ways to define common

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,780
geometric shapes so if you want to do a

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,230
rectangle you can make it any size you

00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:24,720
want you can give a round of it like a

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,130
little bordering this sort of thing it's

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,460
not as powerful as like for example

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:31,740
aboard reuse its CSS where you can do

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,240
crazy things with like order reporters

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,190
that sort of have different slopes on

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,830
the vertical horizontal ones on every

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:40,800
corner to be different it's very limited

00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,690
in an SVG but most of the times you just

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,490
want to do a simple shape in any way you

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,200
can do that the complex ones you can

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,960
also do but it requires a little bit

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,980
more manual work usually you want to do

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,790
that with the X icon like a visitor

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,730
anyway so there's other shapes of

00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,440
ellipses and circles new lines and

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,930
polylines are like that little that

00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,990
little lightning you can just put

00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:06,810
coordinates it's pretty easy to do this

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,310
manually you don't need an editor it's

00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,290
you know it's relatively straightforward

00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,350
I won't go through all the syntax you

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:15,750
can just look it up in a reference

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:19,170
polygons etc the last one is more like a

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,550
like a path actually so Pat's it's not

00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,380
that important right now but the past

00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,329
you can do things like lines arcs busier

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,120
curves however you pronounce that

00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:30,880
quadratic curves basically in cute

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,460
little geometric shapes they are vain

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,010
to do manually I'll tell you so it uses

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,720
a weird text based drawing instructions

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,920
thing where your move to a point and you

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,990
draw at another point and you have

00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,330
control points and it's impossible to do

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,520
these things in your head so basically

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,970
copy paste from like sketch illustrator

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,030
an excuse for them so that's that's the

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:55,390
basic fundamental of drawing shapes and

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:59,470
stuff if you wanna reference bitmap

00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:01,600
images or other SVG's there's an image

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,270
element which is not IMG but it which

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,500
the forward again with that X link href

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:11,440
and you know it supports any file format

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,470
that that your your browser would

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,870
otherwise render we've also base64

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,030
encode them in a URL so this is again

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,980
stuff that were all used to and it makes

00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,020
it very very convenient to nest other

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,900
images in your image and reference them

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,620
we use them leverage at all caching that

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:31,630
we have with HTTP it's a nice way to

00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,620
basically have documents that reference

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,080
outer document which is something that

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:40,120
you can't really do with any other image

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:41,800
format like like paint or JPEG it's a it

00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,220
can be a really powerful feature man

00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,110
when used appropriately there's a lot of

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,510
other stuff which you know I don't have

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:52,240
nearly enough time to cover right now

00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,740
you could probably do entire hour long

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,020
talk about each of these things it's

00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,400
there they're amazingly powerful you

00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,630
know you can move all kinda velopment

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,250
and treat them as long and into

00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,180
transformations on top of them it's

00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,320
really cool patterns again

00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,580
transformations right we're not going to

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,540
get into all of that so let's just go

00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:13,330
ahead the SPG gone okay it's something

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,310
where I'm really excited because we're

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:18,820
at CSS conflict but there's also GS com

00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:22,560
tomorrow and the DOM is really how you

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:25,270
make things interactive in HTML and

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,650
almost the exact same methods apply to

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:31,270
SVG so if you're building an application

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,280
in HTML you might as well just do it in

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,540
SVG and say you know we've got all these

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,010
beautiful shapes and lines and

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,920
connecting things a lot of times you're

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:41,320
doing data visualization don't bother

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,060
with HTML and trying to mock things up

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,770
with fake elements all over the place

00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,040
and containers

00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:48,060
right just do this video straight away

00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,610
javascript makes it really easy to deal

00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:57,330
with you do have to worry about

00:19:50,610 --> 00:20:02,730
namespaces because XML you know too

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:05,340
biased against XML I think it's actually

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,650
not too big of a deal one you can easily

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,600
work around it right a couple of helper

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,570
functions that deal with this because

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,560
basically it's the same code so you

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,850
create element set attribute get element

00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,680
except you have to specify a namespace

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,710
which is just a little string day at

00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,880
this net supply it it can sometimes make

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,500
it a little bit tricky like you know

00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,550
what why is this element not showing up

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,560
it's because my browser doesn't

00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,660
recognize it it thinks it's nation LOL

00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,100
and after you should be SVG element it

00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:36,060
gets a little bit weird sometimes but

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:39,180
just keep it in mind to help you with

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,860
that stuff you can also use a number of

00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:45,300
libraries here are some of the common

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:47,010
ones there's a there's a queue that's a

00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,150
green sock is really cool I've been

00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:53,310
using it for some pretty heavy front-end

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,950
animated animated stuff there I'm deal

00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:58,530
with campuses that are hundreds of

00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,810
thousands of pixels squared and the

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,700
performance of this stuff is amazing you

00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:05,910
want to use your probably want to use

00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,330
one of these rappers because things like

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:11,630
transformations in SVG are a pain when

00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:14,220
you when you when you're coming from CSS

00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:16,170
simply because the things like things

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,820
like the the transform origin are a

00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:21,900
little bit different they're not in the

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:24,900
senator in a corner and it just can get

00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,730
really confusing and these these use API

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,490
is a sort of like pave over all of that

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,900
consistency as well as help you with

00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,240
some of the the shortcomings that

00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:36,420
browsers still have today so you know I

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:40,020
able to have a look at these as Rafael

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:44,970
there's synaptics Fiji there's SVG SMG

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:46,590
sap the green some animation so like I

00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,910
said earlier you know the doucher of the

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:50,130
web's is probably going to be web

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,570
components right but I don't know how

00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:55,680
many of you have already been playing

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:56,970
with this I I find amazing

00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,980
that these things are now in the browser

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:02,130
and if you look at things like Oliver if

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:05,610
you look at X tag they just work it's

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,900
amazing you don't really get a lot more

00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,910
flexibility in how you structure your

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,890
application which I'll just to reuse a

00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:13,530
lot more code which allows us to build

00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:17,040
more advanced software in less time or

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:19,440
at same time and what your point can now

00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,930
do is create your own elements in HTML

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,770
you can do the same thing in SVG and the

00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:27,270
way it works is not really right now

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,450
we're working with things like polymer

00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:34,290
but if you if you do if you coat it with

00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:37,410
a standard epi yourself this actually

00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:39,240
works in the browser test this out and

00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,910
then you can extend the behavior of

00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,910
elements basically making your view just

00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:47,310
an element that you can invoke anywhere

00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,690
you want any application so for example

00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,090
what I'm creating here wouldn't register

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,400
his helmet here I could then instantiate

00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:56,010
that I could assign I could I could I

00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,380
could attach custom behavior to it you

00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,780
would inherit from in this case SVG

00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,790
circle I could make that an interactive

00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:06,470
circle I could attach automatically

00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:11,940
eject all the event handlers that

00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:13,950
monitor touch input eielson foot and you

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,080
know it sort of lets you neatly wrap a

00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,460
lot of your functionality so again this

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,600
is not about web components but I think

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,240
that it's amazing that we can do this

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:25,200
across HTML as well as SVG and again

00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,990
shows the the power that s what she has

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:33,480
in joining our stack as front of

00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:35,520
developers and roller so not just HTML

00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,750
works for this routine we can also do

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:42,930
the same with CSS it's it's what you use

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:45,360
to basically give a markup and there's

00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:50,430
there's a lot of different ways to do

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,480
that with CSS in SVG so here's some of

00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,120
the common ones there's a lot of other

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,890
ways as well but sort of the the main

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,320
ways of doing it especially when you're

00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:02,010
doing in line SVG in your document which

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,620
is why it's so preferred is to actually

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,420
have your CSS referenced like you would

00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,540
normally have it in your HTML page in

00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:12,860
HTML document

00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:16,880
and it can actually set selectors here

00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:20,059
your CSS that target things inside the

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,429
SVG document because it's embedded it

00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:23,950
becomes you know very straightforward

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:26,179
for everyone I'm team to understand

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,220
could become you use the same

00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:29,360
modularization approach that you that

00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,640
you would for the other of using

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,140
application and now applies to SVG

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:39,500
elements it's very seamless in councils

00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,440
good you know things like inline CSS on

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,850
your SVG elements directly but again

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,559
just like we don't do that with a

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,590
squeegee these people hope we don't do

00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,240
that those are good HTML and you again

00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:54,230
probably shouldn't be doing a whole lot

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,480
of CSS in line and it's between you just

00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,280
like we would be nice to know there's a

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,920
as you might see here there's a there's

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,530
some new property using SVG what's

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,760
different properties in SVG there's also

00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,020
certain properties that don't really

00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,240
work I'm not going to go through an

00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:11,929
entire list there's plenty of resources

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,210
available online basically whenever you

00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:15,710
draw a line or a shape you use things

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,290
like stroke you settle with on that

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,490
scope you can fill that shape these are

00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,320
very straightforward concepts you can

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,330
move things for like more advanced with

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,700
patterns that you just slug the whole

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:30,440
thing we deliver the texture with some

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:32,559
kind of utter utter designs these are

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,860
things that aren't really there and CSS

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:38,150
they make they make a lot more a lot of

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,880
designs with it something become

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:43,160
possible and that like easy that would

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:49,309
otherwise be really hard to pull off and

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:51,260
playing CSS and HTML so yeah there's

00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:53,030
other ways like I can pull in external

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,590
track style sheets directly into your

00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:58,190
ass with you which is kind of convenient

00:25:54,590 --> 00:26:01,750
when you have a standalone SVG file what

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:04,309
you can do is use at the xml style sheet

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,290
instruction to actually load a CEO that

00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:08,420
smile it's slightly different from what

00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:10,480
you would what you would do with a link

00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,400
tag in HTML but it works just the same

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,309
again allows you to separate all your

00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:19,580
design from your instructor allows you

00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:22,660
to leverage caching again as well so all

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,490
benefits that were used to exist in SVG

00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:27,440
and I'll run through every couple of a

00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,870
couple of things that i came across and

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,160
we're surprising to me in my experience

00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:36,890
using SVG in my web applications there's

00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,850
there's things that are really strange

00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:42,230
at first for example the view box this

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,180
is one this is one of those things that

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,640
you sort of have to you know you have

00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:48,610
the crockett before SVG starts to make

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,110
sense before you can actually think SVG

00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:53,840
the few bucks is an attribute on the SVG

00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:57,020
element where you did turn that great

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,960
you can specify which part of the you

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:03,400
know that sort of SVG canvas will show

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:06,860
up when you embed that SVG in your

00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,450
content it's it's kind of interesting to

00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:13,040
think about that you could actually do a

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:17,630
crop and a transform essentially if you

00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:21,340
look at the screenshot the measuring the

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:23,690
groove the rulers their show the entire

00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,130
document that squeegee document

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:29,870
basically all the campus as well as

00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:34,250
locally and the orange box is what gets

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:36,230
shown where this SVG will be embedded so

00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,810
the like for example the eyes and most

00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:42,950
of the beak of this bird would not

00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:46,010
appear when this which is embedded but

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:48,290
you can easily change which part gets

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:52,060
shown the other thing about the view box

00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:54,290
is that you can stretch and scale

00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:58,400
without having to touch all the

00:27:54,290 --> 00:28:02,270
coordinates in your your geometric

00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,160
shapes in this case if you look at the

00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,570
view box attribute by the way its case

00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,460
sensitive it's kind of painful because

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:10,940
jquery doesn't really like that very

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,410
much a lot about our tools also have

00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,220
issues with that with case sensitive

00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:19,400
attributes but so you have 100 100 200

00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,590
150 now 100 100 is your translation

00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,560
which means that if you have enough like

00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:28,730
if you have a use case where you want to

00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:31,320
pan across an SVG an image you can use

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:34,140
those first two values

00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,520
to move the view box over your image

00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,230
without touching any of the image

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,200
elements and all any of the children's

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:41,910
coordinates is one of those things where

00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,710
I feel like that didn't really belong a

00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:47,400
few bucks but they put it there anyway

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:49,200
and it's there now and you know you

00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,270
usually just leave them at zero zero and

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,640
to deal with the view box that starts at

00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:58,650
the origin point where it belongs

00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:01,530
essentially the 200 150 obviously is a

00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:06,410
the size of the view box but the tricky

00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:08,370
bit about that is that size is sort of

00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,810
it's a little it's a little bit more

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,630
complicated but basically there's no

00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:14,790
units on it and what that means is that

00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,280
you can specify you know you're not the

00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:22,110
work because it's a pixel is this a.m is

00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:24,330
this a point is it up pick up you can

00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,070
use you don't have to worry about limits

00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,200
they're all called user units

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:31,260
essentially in the user coordinate

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,210
system and all kind of stuff they get

00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,490
scaled to whatever you set as the width

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,560
or height now the width or height are

00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:40,190
optional so what that means is you can

00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:43,350
create your L your your SVG content

00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:45,330
independent of where it's going to show

00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:47,010
how large it's going to be but you can

00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,950
still use the simplicity of calculating

00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:53,070
as sort of a virtual pixels so you can

00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:57,570
specify content that's you know 175 and

00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:59,610
25 and just you just look at a 200 as

00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:01,350
your total size and that will scale

00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,060
perfectly wherever that's being used

00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,220
wherever that's which you will end up

00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:07,440
being embedded and as you change the

00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,580
size of the width and the height for

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,490
example if I were to change that to

00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:13,170
percents one hundred percent with it

00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,150
would scale perfectly is very easy to

00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:17,100
make responsive and it scales perfectly

00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:20,220
something really hard to do with HTML

00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,440
you know I imagine if you had to scale

00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,720
an HTML element and all the children

00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,920
automatically you just I think later on

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,120
in the day there'll be some talks about

00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:31,500
that but uh things like flexbox but uh

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:37,830
but that's what G it's extremely easy to

00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:41,070
do this so one issue with that it's what

00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:43,080
happens when you scale them but the

00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,200
aspect ratio is different from that of

00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,380
the few bucks

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,529
you get sort of a funhouse mirror effect

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,250
that's what i was going for you

00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:54,649
essentially there's there's another

00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:59,929
attribute SVG called preserve aspect

00:30:54,649 --> 00:31:02,840
ratio may nicknames it's it's got a ring

00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:09,620
weird syntax but i don't haven't seen

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:11,480
any uh it's similar to that and CSS but

00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:16,250
it sort of works like your background

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:18,980
size property in CSS not as powerful but

00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:22,159
can be used to do similar things where

00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:24,950
background size can do you know

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,370
stretching a background image to contain

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:33,080
or to cover and it will crop the image

00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:34,490
or a little letter box the the

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,350
background image basically in element

00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:40,340
it's sort of the same way where if you

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:44,149
if you embed an SVG element inside let's

00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:47,779
say an HTML block and your HTML blocks

00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:49,519
fetches really wide you can then use

00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:51,620
preserve aspect ratio to detect to

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,090
determine how it gets stretched or if

00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,070
it's squeezed or what happens to it

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,960
there's a you know there's a little

00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:00,409
image here just include as you can find

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,000
us online it's a really you know it's

00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:03,590
one of those things once you get it it

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,929
just makes sense and it's one of those

00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:08,860
things well when you're dealing with

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:11,990
responsive SVG i always reference this

00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,139
move is the this horrible image because

00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:17,149
just explains it every single time

00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:21,399
things like cover and contain become an

00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:24,200
SPG become meet slice things like

00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:25,970
aligning to a good background position

00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,139
where you stick stick elements to the

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:32,899
left to the right to the top to the

00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:34,460
bottom or in the center is somehow x is

00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:37,639
lower case and why is uppercase I don't

00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:39,620
know is it it just makes it up it

00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:40,970
doesn't make a lot of sense and it also

00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,960
doesn't have you to do things like you

00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:47,929
come like you're used to in CSS where to

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,580
go to do it to one side and offset it by

00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:51,169
a certain percentage or a number of

00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,629
pixels you can do slightly thing

00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:55,460
slightly more powerful things in CSS but

00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:58,010
this sort of works

00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:02,049
in a lot of cases and gets job that he

00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:02,049
owes work around us the problems anyway

00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:09,169
one more thing that you should probably

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,860
aware of it unlike HTML you know the

00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:16,340
limit to how big your skin your SVG can

00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,230
rent on the screen so in HTML with CSS

00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,690
you can you can have you can set up you

00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:23,510
know an image that has a million billion

00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:25,370
pixels you know squared or whatever in

00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,720
that minutes and it's fine the browser

00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,770
doesn't really care too much about that

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,830
I'll is still thing and life goes on

00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:37,520
with SVG you know of SPG things crash

00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:41,000
that's do you can crash iOS things run

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,590
out of texture every on on the GPU the

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,740
drivers are buggy for those those kind

00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:47,960
of things and you end up in a really bad

00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,460
situation really quickly it's sort of

00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,520
similar to what happens when you have

00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:56,480
extremely large JPEGs and files other

00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,980
app images the what happens is that they

00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,750
don't get tiled as much as they get

00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,240
rendered into a texture the tribute to

00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:04,929
make things faster the whole thing gets

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,300
rasterized uploaded into the GPU and

00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:12,320
then things have yeah get limited very

00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:14,240
quickly what you need to do really is i

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,919
think use that what I've done anyway is

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,030
use that view box trick where you do a

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:22,460
transform you basically restrain the

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,770
size of the view box and use transform

00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,450
to sort of pan around if you really want

00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,849
to show it at exhuming you can connect

00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,440
it to a a little bit of JavaScript

00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:32,330
you're connected to your scrolling in

00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,129
your panning and as you're as you're

00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,609
moving around just update the view box

00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:38,839
and things render things update really

00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:42,260
quickly lotus which you could sell

00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:43,490
harder x over it anyway you get like

00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,500
let's say here you get infinite

00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:47,210
resolution which basically means using

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,589
that same view box trick you could

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,510
specify a beaut review bucks that's

00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:53,300
unreeling pixels wide and it could scale

00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:55,070
down to how to fixify without the pixels

00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,869
or something you get extreme precision

00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:01,520
but it doesn't really make a difference

00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:03,080
in terms of the limit on how many fixes

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,420
you can render to that's basically

00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,950
limited by the operating system by your

00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,070
graphics drivers and berries from device

00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,100
to device

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,930
varies from browser to browser it's a

00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,090
big picking a little tricky I recommend

00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,370
keeping it under 5 megapixels and that

00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:21,480
means if you have one pixel height you

00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:23,370
can do 5 55 million pixels wide keep it

00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,320
something like the size of this the size

00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:28,620
of the screen is typically are good idea

00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:33,530
don't go beyond that so if you don't

00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:33,530
know me on like a 4k I left that way i

00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,600
wanted to mention a couple of small

00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,880
things about optimizing it's a Fugees

00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,600
because they're written like you write

00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:50,070
HTML yeah things like comments because

00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:52,680
of the way tools output SPG's when

00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:57,270
you're editing them it might turn out if

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,920
you very very verbose code or XML and

00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:02,280
there's there's a tool called s you go

00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,770
let's video I pronounce that it's got

00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,830
easy way to integrate it with your grunt

00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:10,020
and your gulp stack and it's sort of you

00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,070
know compresses it a little bit most of

00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,390
the compression are you getting it on

00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:17,220
svgs is going to be from gzip over HTTP

00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:20,130
its is still going to be plain text

00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:23,310
right but it sort of makes it a little

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:26,130
bit better you'd be surprised how how

00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,380
bad some of the tools are at outputting

00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:31,230
really really verbose for comments that

00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,340
are totally useless things like paths it

00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,230
will string them together into a single

00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,060
path instead of having like many

00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:39,210
sections as your designer is drawing

00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:41,310
them so let's jump too much is really

00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,730
nice to use with that it's all automated

00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:45,930
of course and you know that I think that

00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,350
about covers it but there's a couple of

00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:51,810
more things I wanted to hear animation I

00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:54,510
haven't really touched on now with

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,580
animation you can do it in a variety of

00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,710
ways so obviously you can use CSS

00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:02,040
animations if you've already covered CSS

00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:04,500
SPG certain properties cannot be

00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:09,180
animated right now whereas it could be

00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:11,040
in HTML so instead it might make more

00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,280
sense to use JavaScript something like

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,530
those those those are the wrappers of

00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,150
the API rappers that I mentioned earlier

00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,800
things like jisa I've been using it it's

00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,859
really high performance it makes it very

00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,569
easy into code

00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:27,279
exactly the same as you're used to in

00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:31,900
HTML you can bend you can also use smell

00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:35,619
or sm IL it's actually recommended way

00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:38,710
of moving animations in in SVG it looks

00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:39,999
really nice when you quoted it's

00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,059
basically just another attack is the

00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:45,279
anime to tag I'm not going to go into

00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:49,539
detail here again it's a whole top of a

00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:51,599
topic of its own but it gets really good

00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:55,420
performance it's the way forward and

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:58,299
speaking of the way forward we're going

00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:01,180
to have SVG to presume that shows that

00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:02,710
there's a similar to that show that

00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:05,019
there's a lot of promise a lot of

00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,700
investment happening in to SVG because I

00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:08,160
think people recognize that it is part

00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,980
of the future of front-end development

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,999
there was an effort all.svg 1.2 there

00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,619
was a whole bunch of stuff going on

00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,059
around us we'd be tiny for mobile

00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:18,369
devices you know it turns out that

00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:20,289
mobile devices are as powerful as that's

00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:24,430
no more powerful than Meyer grab your

00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:26,230
laptop there and that whole effort sort

00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:29,200
of God you know rebooted and it's

00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:32,380
alcohol des v-22 and it's going to have

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,150
you know some improvements over SVG 1.1

00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:37,869
which is like I said the current one

00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:39,549
current version but it's it's I think

00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:40,869
it's more about getting all these

00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:43,809
companies that are building our tools

00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:45,279
that are all of us who are using it

00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:46,749
getting all these people organizing

00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:48,160
their community again to improve the

00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:50,230
standards that work with on a day-to-day

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,660
basis and I think that's really exciting

00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:55,509
and I look forward to using more

00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,190
standards like SVG in our bucket

00:38:55,509 --> 00:39:02,380
applications to make better products for

00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:11,319
our users and I think with that thank

00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:17,109
you thank you SAP QA and we have one

00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:20,289
question hello do you suggest replacing

00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:23,200
all images on the web site with SVG or

00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:27,239
do you have certain ways to figure out

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:30,730
which images to changes to the estrogen

00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,810
good question good question so there's

00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,780
going to be images

00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:36,670
that are you know more suited to JPEG

00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,120
compression compression very high

00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,680
velocity compression right things like

00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,540
things that you would do with Bing files

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,640
a lot of times work better with a

00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:48,700
squeegee simply because you're using

00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:52,180
pain actually for with with lossless

00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:54,340
compression when especially when there's

00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,830
a lot of geometric shapes and that works

00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,240
perfectly with SVG and in fact most of

00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,640
the times the tools that the designers

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,130
use to create those images are in fact

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,660
vector editors so you might as well

00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,150
output that straight away especially

00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:10,300
once you go looking at everything has to

00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:12,550
be read in assets for mobile devices

00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,590
things like that it makes a lot of sense

00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:19,240
to turn pretty much everything files

00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:23,110
into an SVG JPEGs not really but you

00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:26,770
could still use them to do so like

00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:28,150
reference them from an SVG element just

00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:30,970
to get access to things like filters

00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,280
transformations again but filters you

00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,380
can do blending modes which basically

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,580
means that you could dive a little bit

00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:41,980
deeper into the stack of how your images

00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:45,370
are composited and if you can take your

00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:48,100
smaller you know la la si compressed

00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:50,680
files and composite them using blending

00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,720
modes you might save a lot of space as

00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,210
well I might be able to do a lot more

00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:01,150
cool effects with those images using SVG

00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:03,580
again all right more questions hello um

00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:06,700
so when you use normal pictures they all

00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:10,080
indexed by Google so what degree are

00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:12,580
Google indexing SVG even I'm just I

00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,440
think you'd have to ask google that I'm

00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:17,050
not sugar haven't gotten tests on to SU

00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,420
I'm sorry I can sure thanks in theory

00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:21,010
though it shouldn't be impossible at all

00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,840
it's basically the same it's just

00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:25,570
another document but they could parse

00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,370
very easily it might actually be a lot

00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:29,820
easier than doing single day jobs which

00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,820
you know we're all doing

00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,700
do you suggest the fallback solution too

00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:41,600
just in case process doesn't support SVG

00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:43,340
so load in PNG or whatever so if you're

00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,260
using something like Raphael they go all

00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,290
crazy and they've sort of replicate SVG

00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:52,880
using is a single vml for Microsoft

00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:55,640
which is like years old you could do all

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,920
that there's also cases where you're

00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,500
using just SVG as a rendering back-end

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,850
like for example with vgs but if you're

00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,480
building applications it's really hard

00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:07,970
to do that so you have to consider your

00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,940
audience and decide whether SVG is a

00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:12,320
appropriate solution today even if it

00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,600
isn't I think it makes sense to look at

00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,310
it because in a couple of years everyone

00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,810
will actually have support and I think

00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:21,110
even if you look at can you accommodate

00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:25,400
xfinty has amazing support and most most

00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:27,560
browsers and devices I've been

00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,220
struggling with working with the SVG Dom

00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,950
getting assets for the SVG DOM and

00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,780
manipulating them in JavaScript do you

00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:38,120
have any kind of workflow that you've

00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:41,870
used before to get those assets

00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:44,420
optimized and just for work with SVG

00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:47,270
dumb how would you load it just in high

00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:51,260
level general do you mean I spent your

00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:56,510
assets what happens its assets that you

00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:58,100
can just load up into SVG Dom inside

00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,340
your document and then manipulate

00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:05,990
manipulating JavaScript like reading sog

00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:08,410
based applications okay so for example

00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:11,510
if you're using tools like sketch

00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:13,660
illustrator day like sport like the SPG

00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:16,850
pads if you if you consider that asset

00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:18,350
right so when you're doing it when you

00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:22,040
do animations you can also do animations

00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:24,110
along a path for example you typically

00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,330
keep those in separate files and I like

00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:29,840
to have build tools that again I've

00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:31,940
category inject them according to IDs

00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,220
and n reference them by ID which

00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,510
typically I mapped to a file name but

00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,210
these are just these are just my

00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:40,280
personal conventions it's an interesting

00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,740
question I'm sure as more people use

00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,550
them use SVG I think more of these

00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,800
patterns will become

00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:48,440
sort of commonplace I think right now

00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,540
it's a very flexible very fluid kind of

00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,470
scenario so everyone's just testing it

00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:59,210
out happy to talk more about it as I get

00:43:54,470 --> 00:44:01,600
more experience with it myself hi just

00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:04,580
ask another question about html5 canvas

00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:08,740
so these are most motor thing to talk

00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:12,170
about SVG's kind of can be done in

00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:15,920
ischemic campus and to me right the HTML

00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:19,130
canvas renders less elements in just one

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,250
dumb animal fly itself so in SVG

00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:24,440
actually kind of create a lot elements

00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,840
especially when you do some current

00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,860
interactions you add my admin side so

00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:33,800
the I think the dogs had two renders a

00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:36,710
lot so what do you think what that s the

00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,980
converse is self can be Brenda as a as

00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:44,590
an image so to me is rather Easter on a

00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:44,590
light so what do you think about that

00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:53,570
was relevant a lot I think when you look

00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:56,300
at SVG there's you can look at it as

00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:58,850
there's content there sometimes you look

00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:01,520
like a lot of data in your recipe and

00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:02,930
it's nice to be able to like to be able

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,840
to index it away or reviews that are

00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:07,520
tools to access that data whereas if you

00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,520
render it all into a bitmap I'm really

00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,760
hard to do that it's also the all the

00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,920
geometric shapes the paths those are

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,130
such as drawing instructions which you

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,540
know if you're gonna draw into canvas

00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:23,230
you still need a passive instructions

00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:26,470
you need JavaScript doing it again with

00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:28,640
SVG they become a little bit more

00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,140
normalized sort of other tools can help

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,260
optimize them and simplify those

00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,850
instructions I don't think that canvas

00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,760
has that much of help advantage of

00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:40,190
performance again in various relative

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,190
rouser but I think the number of

00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:45,610
elements by itself is not really

00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:48,420
metric for performance is I think having

00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:50,860
more office actually helps us develop

00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,650
because it gives you better insight into

00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:58,540
how is this constructive how is this

00:45:53,650 --> 00:46:00,180
module constructed again things like be

00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:05,380
able to create your own custom elements

00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:07,180
of the few cat but I think that's
