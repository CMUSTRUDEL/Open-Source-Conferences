Title: Sebastiaan Deckers: The SVG Reality - CSSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2015-01-17
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	SVG is weird. It looks somehow familiar and can be handled similarly but it has its distinct differences and purpose from the technologies you know, like HTML and CSS. In this talk I want to share my experiences getting started, embedding and using SVG in modern web applications.

Seb is a frontend fanatic hailing from Belgium. He now lives in Singapore where he helps startups build browser-whipping web apps at Cofounders.sg and hosts the Front End Developers Singapore (FEDS) meetup.
