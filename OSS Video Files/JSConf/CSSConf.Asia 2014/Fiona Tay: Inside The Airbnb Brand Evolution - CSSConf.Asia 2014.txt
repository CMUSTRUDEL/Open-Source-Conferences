Title: Fiona Tay: Inside The Airbnb Brand Evolution - CSSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2015-01-28
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	You siao ah?! That was my reaction when the Airbnb marketing team told me in January that my team of three would be redesigning the entire airbnb.com site in just six months. I didn’t know how we could rewrite thousands of lines of HTML, written over six years by many different developers, while the rest of the engineering team continued to develop new features. 
In this talk, I’ll share how we created and rolled out a new CSS framework based on Object-Oriented CSS principles to launch a fresh new look while keeping our sanity!

Fiona is an engineer on the Core Web team at Airbnb, where she builds tooling for the web platform. She has previously worked on rolling out an internal OOCSS framework across airbnb.com, scaling email infrastructure, and making airbnb.com mobile friendly. She likes design, testing and biking.

	00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:20,939
hi everybody very glad to be here

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,970
speaking to you guys about it so I'm

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,650
here to talk about our Airbnb brand

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,289
evolution which we launched in july of

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,119
this year so before I can talk about the

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,410
brand evolution I got to introduce a

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,410
little bit about the history about

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:39,690
Airbnb so who here in the house has ever

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:44,370
used Airbnb before whoa yeah so Airbnb

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:46,890
was born in 2008 when originally known

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,760
as air bed and breakfast so our founders

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,809
Joe and Brian they they were they were

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,760
running out of money and they couldn't

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,480
pay rent but there was a big conference

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,190
in town called a design conference and

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,379
just like CSS come actually and they

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,359
were thinking what if we hosted a bunch

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,820
of people and let them stay in a house

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,040
and you know charge them like fifty

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,060
dollars a night and so they do have a

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,130
bunch of air beds and hosted some guests

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,140
there and give them breakfast and from

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,950
then on they known as air bed breakfast

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,689
and over the past six years the company

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:29,820
has grown a lot right now we have 119

00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:31,350
listings in 190 countries and and and we

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,729
are on track to host over 30 million

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,860
nights of stage this year so given that

00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:40,259
you know maybe we don't want to be just

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,840
another internet company for bubbling

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,090
blue logo this isn't this off some of

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,159
the internet companies they all have new

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,689
logos and and as we are maturing into a

00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,729
hostelry company maybe we need to

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,730
advance beyond the contour of life we

00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:00,260
are blue we are techne and

00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:02,270
we are cool or something so the the

00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,760
designers last year they set out to work

00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,600
on a new brand identity is a bunch of

00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:11,750
designers and hanging out and looking at

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,070
different pictorial representations of

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,440
things that are important to a brand

00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,780
like listings and hosts and so after

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,560
they came of this cave and it came up

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,930
with the new brand and presented to us

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,930
so you guys may recognizes this is our

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,550
new logo it's called the Baylor but

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,230
internally and kind of called a pretzel

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,230
because it kind of looks like a pretzel

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:38,000
and then we had a new vibrant color

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,700
palette like very you fool very exciting

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,070
colors and the new brand would have a

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,630
better focus on our community I guess

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,630
and a horse and all these things around

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:50,210
the globe so this came through my the

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,640
level of my team in january of this year

00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,580
you know basically turn the old old

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,490
website into like a new website and so

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,050
we set out to make your reality and let

00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,640
me talk to a designer differently have

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,680
this understanding of what every brand

00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,209
is you know just change the logo at a

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,420
few hex codes and you should be done in

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:11,450
like a couple of days right okay well

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,090
it's wrong because everyone is basically

00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,400
an engineer's worst nightmare first you

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,510
got you have a hardship date there's no

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,090
flex 2 is a fickle you need to change

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,340
the whole website three initially top

00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,340
secret and for you need to do with

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:34,640
legacy code and not just any legacy code

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:36,739
but legacy CSS which is not very fun so

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,320
then we started thinking about how we

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,959
could ship this project and remain sane

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,660
at the same time and this is tree of the

00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,970
main principles that we had first having

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,980
a say in CSS architecture so that we

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,000
wouldn't find ourselves hand changing

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,800
like thousands of lines of CSS second

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,110
being able to test and measure the

00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,620
progress making sure that on the launch

00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,330
day

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,659
everything goes right and I still have a

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:05,180
job and the third is scalable across the

00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:07,819
site because we have so many different

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,319
products that we need to change so first

00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:12,830
thing talking about same CSS

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,870
architecture just we want to have

00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,780
approached the CSS that doesn't drive

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:21,680
anyone nuts which may not be that easy

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:25,580
because the CSS so Xzibit one of typical

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,280
CSS code this is actually real quote

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:32,210
from our site so I'm not exactly the

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,430
most proud of it as we heard from a

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,620
Christian earlier today you should not

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,840
have any ID selectors and injustice two

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:44,240
lines of code we have over like five ID

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:46,340
selectors so it's very sad so given this

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,370
state of the CSS imagine going through

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,880
thousands of lines of CSS and removing

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:55,190
all the rounded corners text shadows

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,110
standardizing the 13 or 14 or I don't

00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:00,289
know 200 sheets of free doesn't sound

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,240
fun right and what kind of accessory

00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:04,460
baited it for us is the Airbnb over the

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,220
past six years has had a tremendous

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,530
group which is great because I have a

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,510
job but it's bad because it's hard to

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,099
focus on quality and we have so many

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,020
different business challenges that we

00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:17,000
are trying to put out the latest fires

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,610
and building the latest features and

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,919
it's so hard to focus on quality and so

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,979
the amount of CSS we had just kept

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,250
growing and growing and growing and to

00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:30,650
me at CSS the power CSS is that at some

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,979
point about like let's say a thousand

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,990
lines of code you have your a past that

00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:37,340
point you are unable to like read over

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,150
the code and figure out what it's doing

00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,919
because it's it's so real it's not real

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,169
it's rarely tested you don't know that

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,150
in fact of your change and it's just so

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:50,720
easy for you to slap on an ID like

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:55,039
Christian said to to just fix that that

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,470
visual bug that you have and so I kind

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,450
of want to bring in the sentiment

00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,920
this guy called Michael feathers who

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,560
wrote a book on dealing with legacy code

00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,950
and the definition of legacy code is

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,740
basically any code that's untested and

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:14,580
by the definition all CSS is legacy code

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:17,170
all right table because by definition

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,810
CSS is not it's usually not tested you

00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,760
there's no way to understand in fact of

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,170
your changes so in a way it's kind of

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,630
true but that's not the end of the world

00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:31,840
that's actually a better way to do CSS

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,670
and this is a quote thing the easiest

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,710
way to keep your quarantine avoids to

00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,960
write less of it and that applies for

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,570
Ruby code or JavaScript code it also

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,660
applies for CSS code so what does it

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:46,240
mean to write less CSS code so we have a

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:51,280
concept of CSS frameworks they can write

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,810
once and reuse so that nobody you don't

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,760
need to reinvent the wheel for every

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,370
single button inside you can write a

00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,620
room for one button and it just works

00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,590
and bootstrap and foundation are two of

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:06,580
the CSS frameworks as right of the box

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:08,590
and so luckily for Airbnb even though we

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,380
had to deal with six thousands of nigel

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,270
CSS we were actually working on my

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,580
natural CSS framework that we called 02

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,780
which was based upon bootstrap but

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,150
called down for a specific use case and

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,890
we have been working on this for about a

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,870
few months and we've begun rolling out

00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:29,020
to be about ten percent of the pages by

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,940
the time the rebrand project started I'm

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,740
gonna make a side note about why we call

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:36,010
it 02 because it sounds very sciency

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:38,530
it's kind of a nerdy job because 02 is

00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:44,310
the scientific notation for oxygen and

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:44,310
you can't have air BnB with oxygen

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:52,880
so so we had this framework called 02

00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,190
and and on the left is 10 to look like

00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,850
at a stop the project and so we had this

00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:01,420
idea you know given our new rebrand

00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:04,400
feeling rebrand designs what if we just

00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:07,760
update the skin 402 and you see on the

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,670
right is all the same elements but just

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,230
in a slightly different style and

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,150
preserving the same Dom API like four

00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,100
button in the old way it's called a

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,590
button primary and it's a blue button

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,360
and then in a rebrand ways it's still

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,960
called button by it just has a slightly

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,870
different color and this is kind of

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,180
magical because if we basically promised

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,280
like all the engineers across the side

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,580
and if you use o 2 components you get an

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,470
instant rebrand because whatever means

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,570
is that if you use auto components will

00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,560
just change the CSS framework out for

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,670
you and you don't even need to do

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:46,820
anything get new styles so this is an

00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:50,270
example of a page that use only Oh two

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,940
components and and when we just change

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:56,840
out the different version of 02 it looks

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:59,000
completely different and it's a great

00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,160
formats because then you can scale the

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,410
rebrand across the site without having

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:09,560
to write that many lines of CSS and

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:11,330
everyone wins so another aspect I wanted

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,430
to make sure is making sure that we are

00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,470
testable that we are progresses test boy

00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,230
immeasurable making sure that we don't

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,670
have any surprises on launch day given a

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,710
bit of a hardship they won't make sure

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:26,630
that on July 17 that everything works

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:29,330
and then hopefully have to have a job so

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,730
what we did was that we made this button

00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,980
call that a lot of people to switch

00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,990
between the odd version and the

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,620
rebranded version and we call it the

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,480
branch st button and by the branch st za

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,370
co and he was very excited about it

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,170
because he was like now I can go on

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,209
airbnb com and you know just click this

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,999
button and see what my

00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:52,939
my baby my site looks like after the

00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:55,790
rebrand but it wasn't just Brian De you

00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:57,589
stood beside even though Brian really

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,259
care a lot about it what we did was we

00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:02,410
wrote it out to all air BMA Airbnb

00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:04,699
employees so that designers engineers

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,980
produce product managers could see the

00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:09,619
most up-to-date version and we roll it

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,629
out to Airbnb employees all across the

00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:14,300
world in Seoul and Beijing a new delhi

00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:19,429
and it was really incredibly effective

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:22,160
for us because anybody in any team could

00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:24,379
could go to the normal page and just

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,470
scroll down to the bottom and click a

00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:29,470
button and see and see what it would

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,329
look like on the day of the launch

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,990
here's an example of our product called

00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:39,639
meetups which is up allows you to RSVP

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:42,230
to meetups organized around the world

00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:45,589
another example would be a wish list

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,329
which is like Pinterest for Airbnb just

00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:50,410
one click you can preview what I would

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:55,309
look like on the day of the rebrand and

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:57,319
just and following up on the idea of the

00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:59,420
different or two versions basically the

00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:02,179
secret sauce is that we would check if

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,399
the user was an admin and if they had on

00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:06,139
they were requesting the rebranded

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,809
version and just serve up a different or

00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:10,579
new package for that actually this is a

00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:12,290
big simplification because we had to do

00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:15,439
some other technical challenges like

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:17,689
caching making sure that our secret rear

00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:21,439
ended early but basically those idea

00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:24,019
behind it in this concept of having this

00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:25,879
single button to test really important

00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:29,540
to give getting really quick feedback as

00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:32,329
changes were made to the system for

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:35,269
instance that what the designers wanted

00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:37,819
they wanted to UM change the design of

00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:40,819
have so what we did was we made a change

00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:43,220
to o'toole we wrote it out airbnb com

00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:45,499
and then the designer could could see

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,999
what it look like across the site but by

00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:51,769
just clicking that button and this quick

00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:53,899
iteration cycle a lot of catch some

00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:57,019
really interesting box or some really

00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,339
bad CSS box if you rewrite like a few

00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,949
thousand signs of CSS you're going to

00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:02,929
break something but you can't break

00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:07,480
something come talk to me so they can

00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:10,669
hire you for every and be so anyway the

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,470
bug that we caught was that when their

00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:15,079
designer notice that a red links and

00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,929
alerts so kind of ugly so they asked can

00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:19,790
you make it them white so typical

00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:22,970
engineer say is very easy I just write

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:25,249
some code so here's a sample code that

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,980
that one might that you might write to

00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:32,089
UM to make those to make links within

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,559
alerts white white and underlying so I

00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,540
just wanted to take a few moments to

00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:38,419
look at it and see if you guys can guess

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:42,649
what the unintended side effects is kim

00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:44,209
hill is about element selectors so

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:47,209
basically what happened was that when he

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:49,730
had anchor tags in in buttons it would

00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:51,559
overwrite that behavior because it had a

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,529
bigger specificity than the normal

00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:57,439
button selector and therefore buttons

00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:59,149
over the site look like this can you

00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:01,639
imagine what would have happened if this

00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:05,929
had gone on launch day i probably

00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:07,790
wouldn't be here talking to you guys so

00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:09,559
that that's one that there was a great

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:13,699
thing about this allow us to iron out

00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:15,230
along the box as we went along and then

00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:18,649
the third thing I want to talk about is

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,329
scaling the rebrand so for most of you

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,980
guys who have used Airbnb you probably

00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:25,429
think of every video comments a really

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:28,189
simple website just booking and hosting

00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:29,749
like maybe hosts need to respond to

00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:31,490
messages and I know that's about it how

00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:35,169
many pages can then be is about five

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:38,419
right well as I found out reduce project

00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:40,970
airbnb.com comprises of booking and

00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:47,509
hosting and basically like a ton of

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:50,449
other products and so our approach was

00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:52,429
to the promise that we made to

00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:54,690
engineering so say if you got your pages

00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:57,000
on 202 that you gain instant

00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,240
rebrand and this look really well for a

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,110
bunch of all different pages like

00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,900
meetups meetups was by Otto finding it

00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:09,390
those it just into the rebrand landing

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:12,030
pages we got it 202 in an instant

00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:15,030
rebrand Disaster Response a product that

00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:19,470
allows host volunteer to host the

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:22,440
refugees and wish list and and I worked

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:24,810
really well for us but after sit but

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,810
then we come to this some parts of the

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,910
system which is legacy code so the

00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,740
dashboards if you guys have ever used a

00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,110
dashboard the main idea behind it is to

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,630
consolidate all the key features that a

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:39,450
user might one into one place so that

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,580
they can easily access it and that's a

00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,380
really good idea in principle what

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,780
usually happens in the real world is

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,720
that more and more features just get

00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:52,290
sucked into this dashboard and it just

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,990
gets so complicated and for Airbnb while

00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:57,120
Dad was look like was first get a

00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,880
dashboard then me and all the user

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,460
settings things like connecting your

00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,300
facebook your facebook account and then

00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,840
we had random authentication stuff like

00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,270
connecting your two factor

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,250
authentication and then we had advanced

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,230
calendar views you guys have probably

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,030
never seen this but apparently our host

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,950
care a lot about this because it allows

00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:21,180
them to see their listing visibility

00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:25,860
across different properties editing your

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,780
profile important calendars basically

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,660
everything under the sun is in within

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,190
this single dashboard products and so

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,390
when we looked at this product and and

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,460
try to think about what we could do

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:39,930
about it we were asking ourselves the

00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:41,610
question can we even snap this 2020 so

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,440
for a lot of the old pages it was really

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,080
simple to just convert it over 20 to

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,020
because there's a single page and it was

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,900
very simple adapted but for dashboards

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,060
it was a lot more complex because it was

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,440
a monolithic set of features we couldn't

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,920
just change one page because then you

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,130
look

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,040
the others there was one of CSS

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,260
everywhere tons and tons of sprites and

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,810
stirred it was our teen and crafty code

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,700
because all the dashboard features

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:13,529
probably written ones like three years

00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:15,690
ago and no one touch it again so we were

00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:18,360
thinking about it so we talked about how

00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:21,839
can we how can we rewrite this whole CSS

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,670
without going nuts and so we thought we

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,519
needed a more nuanced approach to it and

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:31,380
so we came up the idea of 14 dashboards

00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:33,060
so what do I mean by 14 what we what we

00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,699
did was we create a separate branch of

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:39,930
the entire dashboard application that

00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:43,110
was using o2 and we relaunched it only

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:45,389
to admins so for every page within the

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,449
dashboard we would check if the user was

00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:52,290
allowed to exit view the go-to version

00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:54,570
if they were admin and in that case show

00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:57,930
them the 02 version and if not show them

00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:59,579
the whole shitty version and this is a

00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,829
really complicated approach compared to

00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:03,600
just updating it to odo but it was

00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:05,549
really necessary because this is just

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,919
like so complicated and so big that

00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:12,839
rewriting the CSS is just kind of

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:15,329
untenable and for all the property code

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,370
that we that that nobody really knew

00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:19,350
about we try we engage different teams

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,209
to work on it so like for instance a

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,699
really complicated calendar page we will

00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,890
ask the team that down host to look at

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,500
it because it would just be too scary to

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,660
touch and here's example of us using a

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:35,370
sauna to talk to the payment scheme and

00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:39,660
ask them to help out for us and so over

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:42,059
a span of four weeks via 14th we pop we

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,070
 it in and did a first pass over

00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,540
all the different pages and then we

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,549
spend another two weeks finding on a box

00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:52,500
which is you guys probably know finding

00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:54,030
boxes using pretty long process and the

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,919
third part was whiskey profit which is

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,919
not really a part but never mind

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:04,519
and so on after we we had snapped it 202

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,590
in and and then so here's what it looks

00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:11,870
like after that nice and clean and we

00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:18,200
deleted over thousands of lines of code

00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:21,559
after merging the fork so the last thing

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,389
I want to talk about is is it's the

00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,850
overall project what does it mean to be

00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:28,210
successful as a rebrand so it's really

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,620
interesting because like for a lot of

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,059
projects you can see that the success of

00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:36,440
our project is a fifty percent more

00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:38,480
users all we have we have increase in so

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,460
and so metric but that's not really how

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,760
r e breads work the main purpose of a

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,220
rear end is to revise an existing brand

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,809
and make it feel fresh and new and I

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,760
think the biggest testament to that

00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:53,210
would probably be this quote from

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,679
somebody from a designer actually saying

00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,690
this is one of the best roles that I

00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,309
have seen a long time there's a

00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,260
long-term vision for the brand here that

00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,789
we really started to take hold and like

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,010
to say over time this will be a very

00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:07,370
recognizable icon on properties all over

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:10,179
the globe and it's especially impactful

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:13,039
because as a digital bread airbnb com

00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:14,600
presence to the user is is our website

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,399
our guests and hosts me each other from

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,269
website and they spend lots of time

00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:23,409
there and so and so the visual identity

00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:29,299
of Airbnb is really tied to airbnb com

00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:32,059
and so I after this horse protect we had

00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:37,460
20 engineers working on this 500 plus

00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:40,820
pull request 941 files captain over

00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:43,549
10,000 lines of CSS leader and I think

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,960
one of the biggest things that biggest

00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,690
things I liked about this project was

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,549
opportunity to get rid of all legacy CSS

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,669
and bring us into a fresh new world

00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:55,429
where we can have river and a well

00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:56,899
encapsulated CSS framework I used to be

00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:59,659
really afraid of touching coat on

00:19:56,899 --> 00:20:00,240
dashboards because basically to make any

00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:02,760
changes

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,059
we need to trip either at an ID selector

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,420
or throw to the thousands of light of

00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:11,610
CSS and being able to go to a featurette

00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,780
just start writing CSS and not be afraid

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:19,920
of breaking things is such a wonderful

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:21,690
and freeing feeling and cell area and in

00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,700
this whole project we managed to get

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,610
everything on o2 and for the first time

00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,740
every page on airbnb com is implemented

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:34,710
using our own in-house UI and a

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:36,090
consistent de la design language and so

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,240
that's basically all I have for you to

00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:44,760
share about the rear end you guys have

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:47,640
any questions hi my name is honest I am

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,070
a question you said you build up on the

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:55,280
Twitter bootstrap framework and you

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:57,750
picked your own stuff I don't know that

00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,420
so how do you maintain that like you

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,390
have you been up on Twitter and if they

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,550
come up with a new version of bootstrap

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,620
do you put that changes in or you

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:11,130
maintain your own framework or like how

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:13,050
do you move on with that I guess it's

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,550
not really so much as from Twitter

00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,650
bootstrap as inspired by Twitter

00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,150
bootstrap because our set of elements is

00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,550
actually quite different than Twitter

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,020
bootstrap tara has mucho más a lot more

00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:24,510
component than us so we are basically

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:28,830
ours is like a inspiration rather than

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:31,080
or for it oh cool hi thanks for the

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,420
great talk I was just wondering if you

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,220
had any experience with or many

00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,750
suggestions for what I made it ceases

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,100
testing like you my views on a build

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,460
server or a continuous integration

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,800
environment oh it's a continuous

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,390
integration solution for CSS yeah like

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,059
what a mega because it seems like the

00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:51,630
pattern it's more menu or human based

00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:54,030
testing but something to be kissed by a

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,710
computer yeah so that's actually a

00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,540
really interesting question because like

00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,520
I use I used to do a lot more real

00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,170
engineering and like in the case you can

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,850
write spectable what it looks like and

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:05,490
unfortunately that doesn't really exist

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:08,160
for CSS your build tools that allow you

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,590
to compare screenshots before and after

00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,390
using an integration of capybara I

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:15,030
believe what we haven't really tried

00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:17,309
using it because for us one of the

00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,290
biggest things is just manually testing

00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:21,780
across the set of browsers we support

00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:24,030
which is quite extensive like including

00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,309
supporting ie8 so sorry I can't really

00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,860
recommend a good solution there if

00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:34,890
anyone else has any ideas for your chime

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:37,890
in hello what if I say that you change

00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:40,309
from the old you I to the new 22 a new

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:43,470
point and if I if when you are trended

00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:46,380
you are registering a plan and develop

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,190
are adding new features how do you

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,160
handle it

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:56,520
I mean you need to do something in old

00:22:50,160 --> 00:23:00,690
UI and so for the bout majority of the

00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,850
side we simply dropped in a different

00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:06,150
I'm CSS framework so it was up to the

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:08,490
developer to check that with the new CSS

00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,350
that it look good but for dashboards

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,900
because we it we actually had to

00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:16,950
a tell everyone that you have to add

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:19,590
your features to both and and designer

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,870
debt and mine which was which was not

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:25,020
easy by was the only way to do it ok

00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:27,470
thank you right big engine Fiona thank

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,470
