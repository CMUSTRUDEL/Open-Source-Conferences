	00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:24,359
when you think about a conference you

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,880
can draw some parallels to what a

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,760
conference is versus our sort of daily

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,189
work that we do in some ways a

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,469
conference is kind of our Olympics or

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,079
its kind of our space launch or our

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:41,180
Grand Prix and I guess we all kind of

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,020
just win by being here together I mean

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,600
it's not every day that you get to

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,640
launch rockets but I think that this is

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,440
this is one of those such occasions I

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,030
think we should enjoy being here

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,230
together especially at the first CSS

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,850
come here in Asia which i think is

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,059
 incredible because Singapore is

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,629
amazing and I am really really happy to

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:04,470
be here as well today my talk is not a

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:08,700
it's not about code it's about being a

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,010
coder I guess or designer I'm asking the

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,930
question what are we doing anyway and I

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,880
talked about the Space Launch is if that

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,689
was something that we aren't sort of

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,180
really doing you know we're often like

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,250
this is our environment we sit looking

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,090
at a terminal with a blinking cursor and

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,740
we're typing in there all day or maybe

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,390
we're hitting reload all day and

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,020
swearing at a browser and looking at the

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,090
box model and I think what's really kind

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,390
of interesting when you think about what

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,869
it is that we do we you know I mean

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,270
before the web was this intangible thing

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,299
you know when we had big CRT monitors

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,810
that sat on the back of our desks you

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,860
know it like we had no connection to to

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,520
the web but what's really interesting

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,719
about now is that we're just surrounding

00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,280
ourselves in their screens and they're

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,810
just smaller they're in our pockets and

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,880
they're in out bags and there are no

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,119
tiny laptops and so we don't have

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,799
tangibility over our work really but

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,149
it's just closer so we tell ourselves

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,130
that it's okay and we're actually

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:15,390
building something visible or not

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,540
anyway I'll introduce myself super

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:22,950
quickly I'm Ben I'm from Melbourne

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:27,000
Australia I'd say that I was a designer

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,100
but I would be lying I didn't go to

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,620
design school I did art in high school

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,070
and that was about my sort of design

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,750
background I studied multimedia design

00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:40,620
I'd say I was a developer but I didn't

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,780
study in computer science so i guess i

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:48,120
would say that i was i just build things

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:51,420
for the web i'm mostly self-taught like

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,310
probably a lot of you are I certainly

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,840
didn't start doing stuff for the web

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,440
because it was easy to describe to my

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,180
parents I just did it because I was

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,770
working on a computer and I was really

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,230
interested in how I created something

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,030
and I think that's probably true for a

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:10,250
lot of you here how many people are

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:14,550
self-taught wait sheriff you okay maybe

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,440
fifty percent i think i think you know

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,180
maybe we get into doing what we're doing

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,340
because we have this sort of dedication

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,110
to a creative endeavor or we're just

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,700
chasing a desire to learn how to do

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:29,670
something also i forgot to mention it so

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,090
I'm a contractor I work for sort of

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,010
maybe four to six companies a year I'm

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,450
one of the three founding members of CSS

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,160
conf Australia and I just try to build

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,140
stuff that I enjoy doing and that's

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,100
that's what my talk today about it is

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:51,540
about but the actual fact is that I have

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:54,930
no idea what I'm doing today I'm going

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,440
to talk about fun and goofy or fun /

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,720
goofy over profit so let's think about

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,850
that for a second what is fun and goofy

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,239
funds pretty self-explanatory but what

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:08,400
is goofy goofy means like fully ashore

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,260
just harmlessly eccentric and so I'm

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,209
talking about the the idea of building

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,739
things just for the hell of it just for

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,280
like the sake of learning or just for

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,280
having fun

00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:26,240
so I would say im doing this but I have

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,950
no idea why I just am Brad bells at

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,910
cascadia jeaious said creative clewd is

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,880
an experiment with the goal of

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,050
surprising and delighting I think it's

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,320
much easier to say that something is

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:40,980
goofy but that's just me he also goes on

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,820
to say that when you do something that

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:47,550
is an experiment you do it because it

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,169
might make you a better engineer you

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,580
don't necessarily just quit your job but

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,240
you know maybe you should just take a

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,100
day off and try to build something so

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm going to tell you a story I bring

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:08,430
water somebody's water I'm going to

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:09,870
drink it anyway tasty all right

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,560
so I'm going to tell you a couple of

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,840
stories today and they're just sort of

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,820
points in my career over the last 13

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,770
years they're not like the best things

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,170
I've ever worked on they're not things

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,500
that may be made more money than other

00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:27,330
stuff that I've done but I think they're

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,790
interesting for the sake of they were

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,790
really fun but they were seriously goofy

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:42,510
okay one afternoon sometime in 2009 i

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,430
was i was actually putting together a

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,040
series of html5 workshops this is when

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,680
here smell 5 was a new thing we still

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,630
called html5 her for one thing I was I

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,240
went to a meet up and I said hey I think

00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,320
I'm gonna maybe do some workshops she

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,540
would be interested in doing it it's

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,530
gonna be a whole day there'll be 300

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,330
bucks who wants to come 70 people in the

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,920
room with their hands up and I sort of

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,440
looked at the ground really nervously

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,880
and I said I'll get back to you and two

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,820
weeks later I put aside up and I sold

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,920
all of my tickets in like an hour

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,570
suddenly I had like fifteen thousand

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,360
dollars in my bank account and I had no

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,520
idea what I was doing I had a date I had

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,730
a venue but I still have no idea what I

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,320
was doing and I guess what I wanted to

00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,530
do was I just wanted to know everything

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,570
I didn't want somebody to be able to say

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,980
well what happens when that doesn't work

00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,590
in this browser or what happens in this

00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,380
situation I didn't want to be blah so I

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,210
started reading w3c's facts and I just

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,100
wanted to know how does everything work

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,960
I'll just I'll just read

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,580
everything and nobody would be able to

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,980
prove me wrong and I started and I

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,560
quickly realized that w3c specifications

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,260
are not built for normal people they're

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,150
built for people he told browsers and so

00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,770
I mean I was going to get to the

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,690
workshop eventually I was eventually

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,910
going to start preparing that I mean it

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,230
was only in a week and i had only you

00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,000
know taking a lot of people's money and

00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,010
by that point and so I was madly

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,480
researching I took like time off work

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,630
and I was just reading and researching

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,070
and trying to develop this content but I

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,420
stopped and I I just did something

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,380
there's a little hack project one

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,180
afternoon I went into devtools and I

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,440
started messing around with the

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,800
developer

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,720
improved like the spec information I

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,370
started changing margins and tweaking

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,450
the typography and changing the line

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,460
heights of everything just trying to

00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,520
make everything more readable because I

00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:39,150
didn't really want what i was looking at

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,730
and I thought hey this is this is pretty

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,860
cool maybe I'll maybe I'll show it to a

00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,420
co-worker and you know maybe I'll make a

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,390
little bookmarklet out of this thing and

00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,240
so I did and I tap you know quickly as

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,890
fast as I could in under an hour made

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,470
this little bookmarklet that basically

00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,240
took this pic added these weird styles

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,060
that I decided were better than the

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,520
other ones for whatever reason and I I'd

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,620
showed it to my friend Anthony pushed it

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,450
took your hub and a day or two later I

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,230
just tweeted like oh hey here's some

00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:14,730
user styles good luck does it I thought

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:16,920
the project was earlier and for the next

00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,860
three hours I watched my phone explode

00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,710
in ways that I had never seen my phone

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,990
exploited I have been working on open

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,890
source for a long time and I was kind of

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,140
building things that I thought were

00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,550
interesting I wasn't really getting that

00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,530
much attention and this thing that I

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,590
just kind of threw together when I was

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:36,120
just messing about you know

00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:39,150
procrastinating essentially suddenly was

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,150
making my phone melt on my desk on the

00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:47,520
fourth hour Paul Irish retweeted it my

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:49,050
phone exploited for this evening and the

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,820
next day paul got in touch and he

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,380
actually sent me a pull request and the

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,910
pleura quest was like oh hey I fixed

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,650
your fonts in Firefox because

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,430
cross-domain issues it wasn't working

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:01,320
whatever I said hey cool thanks Paul

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,730
George did I was like oh my god this guy

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,780
actually knows who I am this is super

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,370
cool what was one of my heroes and the

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,430
next thing was I got an email from him

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,810
saying hey what are you on gchat

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,880
suddenly pulled message mean he's like

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,170
hey what up no seriously the

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,490
conversation that was I'd look back

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,650
through my message history that was the

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,890
message he sent me friendliness guy ever

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,690
and what was really interesting was that

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,250
like like I said this was something that

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,230
I just threw out and I didn't think was

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,080
important or interesting even I was just

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,540
doing it for the hell of it but I wasn't

00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,830
just pull other people kept coming out

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,370
of the woodwork other people from

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,380
organizations like W

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,730
see people like Steve Souders and people

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,960
who work for browser companies were

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,070
actually interested in the work that I

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,690
was doing people that I respected you

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,890
know it wasn't just dorks on the

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:52,089
internet these were like my heroes a

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:55,089
little while later this is a great shot

00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,700
of me mid-speech I look much younger but

00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:02,230
still be looking of course so this is my

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:04,870
talk from web directions 2010 so this

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,000
was a little bit longer and I was on

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:12,370
this whole tip about how evil the w3c

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,900
were that um what was really fun that in

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,610
in between those few months of me

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,600
throwing out the sort of bookmarklet and

00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:22,750
this point here was that mike smith from

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,120
w3c got in touch and i actually went to

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:29,020
tokyo for a conference or something else

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,310
and mike said you want to grab a beer of

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,450
course i wanna grab a beer let's hang

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:36,580
out let's let's meet each other and what

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,050
followed was really interesting Mike had

00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,400
actually been working on a specification

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:43,810
that he called html5 for authors and the

00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,300
idea of hicksville five four authors was

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,370
that he took the w3c spec removed all of

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,220
the crazy browser implementation crap

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,900
and just shipped a much smaller version

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,520
of the spec it looked the same but it

00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:00,490
was the content was slightly different

00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:03,779
smaller and we kept talking and you know

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:06,400
we're you know chatting a little bit

00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:09,310
from the same talk this is from you know

00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,440
the same the same moment in time during

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:15,160
this talk Mike and I have been working

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,660
together and we actually took my my

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,070
styles and pulled them out of the

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,480
bookmarklet and fix them and worked on

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:26,170
it for a bit and you'll see this is Mike

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,529
here and what we did during this talk

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:33,190
was I mean he works for w3c any have

00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:35,230
access to deploy stuff so we didn't ask

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,380
anybody but we just hook the user styles

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:42,400
and put them on his spec on the w3c side

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:44,020
and hit deployed from the front row of

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,820
my talk which I thought was the coolest

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,070
 thing in the world

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,620
and I realized holy my work is

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,560
running on their domain I got pulled

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,330
down you should really want to but it

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,959
lost it a few weeks but some people

00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:04,339
weren't so happy it was it was pretty

00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:06,170
amazing a little bit later on after a

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:08,450
few months of nagging whole Irish

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:11,120
convinced me to start joining RC told me

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:14,209
a few channels to join and this

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:19,850
conversation took place I actually took

00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:24,890
this from the logs from 2010 uh so in

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:28,339
hixson okay there we go there it is um

00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:30,140
to kick see up here was like oh hey I

00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:32,120
thought this was really cool the work

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:38,209
that you did what do you say we put it

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:41,060
on what's up ug so we did we we shipped

00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:42,560
this month or so later he just gave me

00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,050
access to deploy whatever I wanted and

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:49,250
here we are it's been online for five

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:51,709
years now it was the thirst w3c extended

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,480
spec that you know obviously what WG so

00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:56,630
is kind of at that point but

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,700
that's a whole other story it was

00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,350
offline capable so you could go into

00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,180
your tablet and it would sink down to

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,300
your device and I was documentation

00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,610
looked a little bit better whatever it

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,100
was cool but I had no friggin idea that

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,630
when i SAT there in 2009 riding a goofy

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,160
little bookmarklet that I scared to one

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,540
friend that this would happen months

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:22,899
later did I'd be working with these

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:25,220
people so as an extension of my talk I

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:30,770
wanted to talk more about commercial

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:34,459
versus fun and don't it's entirely

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:37,459
possible that you here will work you

00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:40,420
know a full visit II busy lucrative

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:42,470
career doing good work for good people

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,730
and your impact on the world will

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,860
actually be minor you're not going to

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,269
disrupt an industry you're not gonna

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,949
you're not gonna fix anything you're

00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:51,199
just going to build good stuff forget

00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,800
people and that's okay that's totally

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,000
fine

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,560
one of the frustrating things about our

00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,870
industry is that predicts die and when a

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,920
project dies underneath you you lose a

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:08,170
little bit of yourself too how many show

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,010
of hands how many times have you lost

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:15,460
something after three months of work not

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,990
too many six months 12 months like

00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:21,670
entire products disappearing there's

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:25,330
couple of folks even good for dicks diet

00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:28,630
I worked on a few projects that died

00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,190
after investing a lot of time and money

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,570
into them and they've disappeared from

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:37,180
underneath me and I had no idea that

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:38,890
they even kind of came or left and I now

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,920
I guess you know I work for myself and I

00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:44,170
am and celery and I'm I'm the person who

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,970
maintains my own happiness and I'm the

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,710
person has to pay my salary and my super

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,990
and worried about my next contracts

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,760
coming in if the contracts good and if I

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,890
need to like yell at my client for some

00:14:51,760 --> 00:15:00,300
reason it kind of sucks but I think it's

00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,300
really important that we focus for fun

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:12,610
it's this world so this is a project

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:16,300
that started in my office we were

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:19,150
drinking beer it was 35 degrees so it's

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,590
kind of Singapore ish we were in a

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,080
warehouse office that had no air

00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,630
conditioning so it was 35 degrees inside

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,790
we were you know beating sweat down our

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,230
heads and we'd all been doing client

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,190
work for the day and we were all kind of

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:35,110
a little bit over it in the office we

00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,810
had just bought a projector and so

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,440
basically we were projecting anything we

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,910
could onto the wall funnily enough we

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,130
started just projecting gifts because

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:49,750
gifts are here are the people who there

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,680
there's me eating a doughnut probably

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,680
wasn't eating a doughnut right down

00:15:50,680 --> 00:16:00,790
there is Glenn Madden there is Tim Lucas

00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:03,190
and there's Josh episode disorder myself

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,350
Glennon's him or CSS conf australia by

00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,860
the way and josh is just a rad friends

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,720
that was so visiting the office that day

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,480
now we sat down and we started working

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:18,910
on this thing called gift city i'm going

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:20,200
to show you give city hopefully just

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,180
remember this is the internet and I

00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,700
don't moderate this content so if

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:37,770
anything comes up that should I'll do my

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:40,450
best ok cool ok so this is gift city

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:48,510
gift city as you can tell is full screen

00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:52,589
gets cool it has basically node features

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,589
except for this guy

00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:02,060
so what gives city does is we take the

00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:05,510
name of a tumblr and we hit the tumblr

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:09,740
API and we just look for gifts pretty

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:12,020
great right we have only a couple of

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,459
features we have the X button which if a

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,110
gift comes up that's a little bit rude

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,780
for the office it is tumblr after all

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:20,150
you hit X and it will remove that gift

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,870
and never ever show it again it's kind

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:25,189
of great and the gifts are random this

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:29,679
is one of my favorite tumblers code

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:34,549
classic but in the source we actually

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,200
know in source we actually keep a list

00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:43,220
of a couple of our favorite tumblers in

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:46,760
here let's see let's find some good we

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:50,330
got some adventure time fans here no

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:56,360
want just right come on you're lying to

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:58,640
me adventure time is the best okay and

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,549
so what's happening here is it's hitting

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,429
the tumblr API for both the classics

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:07,039
tumblr blog and the adventure time gifts

00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:09,260
blog it's found that many gifts and it

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,059
just keeps traversing through the API

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,900
and trying to download more and more and

00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:17,780
more gifts as you'll notice the URL bar

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,460
updates and the query string shows the

00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,360
tumblers that we actually have in there

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:30,370
so if you wanted to you could actually

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:33,860
get the URL actually go on edit the URL

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:39,309
just put anything in there it goes and

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,309
downloads them it's pretty good

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,410
everything else okay

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,780
we set a couple of rules for the for a

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,120
gift city we want allowed to use any

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,940
JavaScript libraries we went allowed to

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,560
use any JavaScript to do the like little

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,960
pop down thing for that we're using the

00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,580
CSS target selector because why would

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,700
you use javascript because we're CSS

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,960
badasses of course and we didn't wanna

00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,320
use libraries we just wanted to do fun

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,420
and dumb JavaScript you know Smashing

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,870
API and put your API key in the source

00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:17,090
code of course that's gonna be amazing

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,530
we focused on fun and so a couple of

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,850
things happened like we were doing this

00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,680
in our office and drinking beer and

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,880
hanging out is pretty great and when

00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,500
somebody else would come in the office

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,120
we would just start like putting gift

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,030
city on and showing them gifts and

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,940
playing music and you know just inviting

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:39,370
people into our office to hang and we

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:41,900
kept going okay cool we kept going and

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,630
we thought we were really cool we

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:47,960
started going to hack events and camp

00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:50,300
JSE's and stuff like that and there was

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,900
one point where we at a New Year's Eve

00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:56,120
party we were projecting gifts 40 40

00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,710
foot high on to a factory building

00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,350
across from the rooftop that we were on

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:04,670
which we thought was pretty cool kind of

00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:08,720
dorks I guess we took a projector to a

00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:10,790
camp and dragged out a cable that was 50

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:16,040
meters long the power cable and started

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:19,700
projecting onto trees it didn't really

00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:22,250
end there for like Tim and Josh and

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:28,070
myself it ended there we were done but

00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:31,460
Glenn wasn't quite done Glenn kept

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,290
hacking we kept as I said going to

00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,390
parties and playings too often hanging

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,160
out and blends like you know what to be

00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,650
really cool if the gifts were synced to

00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,390
music would not be great wouldn't be

00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,010
great if we could like hook it up to a

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,360
turntable and like have an analog

00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,130
control for the gift so we could scratch

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,990
it backwards and forwards would not be

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:51,200
great would it be great if we could like

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,780
put the gifts in 3d and shoot pixels of

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,260
gifts at the camera wouldn't be great

00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:59,290
will be great if we could like just have

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,080
like gifts decoded in the browser

00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:04,110
wouldn't it be great like

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,390
it just kept going and we humid him for

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,150
a little while but to a point we were

00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:11,280
like Glenn I we need to work just please

00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,530
leave us alone and Glenn kept just

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,450
writing code more code and more code and

00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,340
more killer he was experimenting a lot

00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,220
doing weird stuff and he was somebody

00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,790
who had never written JavaScript before

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,580
not much anyway little bits Glenn went

00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:29,300
on and he wrote something called X gif

00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:32,070
which is a web component that actually

00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:35,160
implements a tag in the browser called X

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:37,980
give it has only a couple of options you

00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,200
can set a gift a loop you can set it

00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,970
playback speed and you can do some other

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,590
interesting things he made it as a web

00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:46,500
component he experimented with doing it

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,270
in react and angular and using basically

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,130
every library around to try and go on

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,750
this pursuit of learning web components

00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,540
learning Audio API is learning how to

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,680
break down a gift learning how to I

00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:58,110
don't know what his obsession is but he

00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,910
I think his business card what does it

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:04,650
say no so if you if you don't know how

00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:07,110
to decode a gift in a browser I think he

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:11,940
calls you a gift enthusiast but he's a

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:14,220
gift pro anyway I'm going to show you a

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:19,470
little demo of X gives anyone seen

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:23,160
excuse before lunch flirts cool ok so X

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:25,170
gift takes a gift you add a tag to your

00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,090
browser just like you would an image you

00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,880
say here's the source of the gift and it

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:33,060
plays it just like an image then some

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,820
other cool stuff happens you can

00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,850
actually change the playback of the gift

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,370
so you can do this ping-pong effect and

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,500
then you can even do other stuff like

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:50,760
how many times do you want the gift to

00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:53,610
play through just once tempos and that's

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:59,300
all implemented as attributes on Elm

00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:59,300
pretty cool you can set the speed

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,190
you can set speed so you can say like oh

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:13,120
hey me really fast crazy stupid fast or

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:18,340
just one France then he started working

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:21,630
on beats for a minute and he figured out

00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,630
you could actually sing some audio

00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:10,990
pretty rad so Glenn is super rad he's my

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,309
buddy he's the CSS comp guy as well you

00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,870
should definitely say hi to him because

00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:16,539
i'm using his demos and I'm kind of

00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,519
getting to play music look cool but he's

00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:20,679
cooler than I but I think what's really

00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:22,029
interesting here is that XD ax wouldn't

00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:23,529
have happened if we didn't get drunk in

00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:26,080
the office and just start hacking with

00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:28,630
gifts and this took Glenn on a trip

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,529
where he started giving conference talks

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:35,519
at cascadia jays in portland at JS comp

00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:38,500
in melbourne at JS coffee in berlin and

00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:42,250
his conference schedule continues to get

00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:47,470
booked beyond today because of work like

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:49,179
xq so when it set you a challenge gib

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,760
city started as a one hour challenge and

00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:54,610
it led to hours and hours of learning

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,669
and super amounts of fun so I want all

00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:59,289
of you to go ahead and just do a dumb

00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:00,669
thing whatever the dumbest thing is that

00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,490
you can come up with that you think you

00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:04,899
can do in an hour just try and do it

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,250
fact is if it's fun and you actually

00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:07,870
achieve something in now you're probably

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:13,059
working it for the entire weekend that's

00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:15,220
fine and another dumb project on Fridays

00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:17,620
we have a thing that we

00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,380
and our office called jelly jelly is

00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,120
casual co-working we have a you know

00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,340
reasonably sized office and we just like

00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,289
to invite our friends to come in kind of

00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,820
work and just be around as there for

00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:32,020
lunch have drinks together again the day

00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,630
one particular jelly day I didn't feel

00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,669
like doing actual real work and I've

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:40,120
never used Bauer so of course I should

00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:43,360
do something with Bauer right never used

00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:46,990
it I'd also never ever written any

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:51,370
Python still have no idea what I'm doing

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:52,960
and I didn't even use sublime tix either

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,280
so of course what am I going to do in an

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,980
hour I'm going to write a sublime text

00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,990
plugin in python that uses bowers so we

00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,220
can install bauer packages because i

00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,280
don't know that's the most sensible

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,750
thing that I could do in an hour I

00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,250
pulled something together the kind of

00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,830
worked by reading other people's source

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:11,860
code and over the weekend but fighting

00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:14,620
it up and released it the last time I

00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:17,140
checked this plugin have had over 10,000

00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,820
foot installed and a lot of people

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,650
actually use it I don't use it so if

00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,260
you've got some spare bandwidth and you

00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:25,750
want to fix the issues have a look at

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,730
the issue tracker on there but what was

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,200
really interesting here is that after i

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,200
worked on the assigned about joining the

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,030
bower team which was a totally

00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,770
unexpected result I didn't ever use

00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,510
Bower before this point if like riding

00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:40,809
this dumb thing python and I had no idea

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:44,710
what I was doing and using an editor

00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:47,980
that i didn't use either which kind of

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:51,510
gets me to a point about open source how

00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,510
many people write plus ones on issues

00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:58,000
yeah your old jerks huh i think i really

00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,559
hate this about open source i really

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,179
hate this leg hey please go and spend

00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,370
all of your time and do this for me

00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:05,320
because it really doesn't give anyone

00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:08,200
anything and i want to let you in on a

00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,360
little secret about open source you can

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:16,059
actually do open source without doing

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:21,059
anything this is my strategy watch

00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:21,059
listen learn and just hope where you can

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,419
so the reason I say this was because of

00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:31,320
a particular circumstance that kind of

00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:33,509
came towards me there's the old saying

00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,419
if you don't know what you don't know or

00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:38,220
in my case I would say you don't know

00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:43,320
what you don't know until it literally

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:48,779
falls out of your head for a little

00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:51,809
while I was not a contributor not hadn't

00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:53,850
ridden any code the match media polyfill

00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:55,649
I was interested in the mass media

00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,759
polyfill and I just started sort of

00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:59,700
trolling around the issue tracker

00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,989
following it and sort of looking at how

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,759
it worked it's really simple little

00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:08,519
polyfill and I thought it's cool and

00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:10,590
about two years ago an issue came in

00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:13,350
that said that we should remove this

00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:15,869
code there was a completely new PR that

00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:18,480
rewrote all of this and it was a huge PR

00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:21,720
basically rewrote the entire library and

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,059
I spent hours reviewing it remember I

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,700
was not a contributor to the to the open

00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,499
source project and I just reviewed this

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,850
and the code was really good and so we

00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:31,559
talked about a couple of little style

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,139
things that we wanted to fix before we

00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:39,330
accepted it into the project but it got

00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:42,590
in and months went on one day I was in

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:45,059
my team chat with one of my clients and

00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:47,190
matt said we've got a production

00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:49,379
performance issue on mobile does anyone

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:51,840
know what this crazy minified code that

00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:54,720
says offset with triple equals 42 means

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,090
and I had no idea that I would know this

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,830
until he pasted it and as soon as he

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,389
pasted it I was like that's the match

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,149
media polyfill because I reviewed that

00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:04,980
pull request you know months ago and

00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:06,359
that's the only thing that I could

00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,269
imagine that has code that's this

00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:10,619
ridiculous and because of that I guess I

00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:11,999
knew that there was actually a new

00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:14,039
version of this polyfill which address

00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:16,919
these performance problems and we

00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:19,259
upgraded it the bower package and our

00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,730
performance issue disappeared I know

00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,899
that's a kind of a fun story doesn't

00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,889
happen every time like that but

00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,889
sometimes does

00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:35,710
how many of you build things start

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:39,850
building something maybe working it for

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:41,140
a few hours and never show anyone got

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,660
everyone come on everyone does that

00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:47,770
right I know you do you're lying we're

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:50,260
just late you're lazy or something then

00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:52,780
almost forever particularly earlier in

00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,980
my career I would think of an idea and

00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,770
then ten minutes later I would be

00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,660
writing code and my girlfriend would say

00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,160
are you going to bed anytime soon or are

00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,650
you going to continue to be hacking on

00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,210
your laptop and i would say i'm working

00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:06,130
on my laptop and i would stay there and

00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:09,549
i would be working past two o'clock in

00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:11,140
the morning on this dumb thing and then

00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,120
i would wake up and I'd be bloodshot

00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,309
going to work the next day and basically

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,919
hating my previous decisions of working

00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:19,960
on this dumb thing um but for a long

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,760
time I didn't ship these things they

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,559
were half baked and like they weren't

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,890
really thought to the point of like can

00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:28,419
i actually release this and I think dumb

00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,650
experiments like that are useless

00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:32,049
especially if you're not going to commit

00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,460
to actually showing somebody or actually

00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:35,620
sharing it even with just one friend

00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,730
maybe if you're at your work or someone

00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:40,330
on the internet that you talk to

00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,799
regulate and for a little bit longer

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,500
after that I started bringing my friends

00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,000
into my damn projects and I we also

00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,350
found the situation where we'd start

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,530
arguing about the project before we'd

00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,549
even launch it or showing anyone else

00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,870
we're arguing about silly things that

00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,000
didn't really matter because nobody else

00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,520
knew this thing exists except for one or

00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,770
two people so i'm going to set a

00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,730
challenge for all of you here the next

00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,290
time that you're going to build

00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:07,600
something that you don't think you're

00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:14,559
going to ship i'm killing kittens that

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:18,429
guy two guys should shoot so don't count

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,510
your days make your days count work on

00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:21,940
projects that you think that you'll

00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,100
share work on projects that are fun work

00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:28,480
on projects that are dumb don't

00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:30,960
necessarily do it for money celebrate

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,020
your wins when you do something cool

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:39,340
enjoy it may be launched something on

00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,600
your birthday right so for me I don't

00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,860
know about you

00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,999
common birthday is you wake up and you

00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,669
spend time with your partner or your

00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:48,470
family and then they say I have to go to

00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:50,539
work today and you say okay I'm not

00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:52,460
working today and then the house goes

00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:56,840
quiet and sit by yourself looking at

00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:59,119
Twitter it's pretty boring isn't it so

00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,860
instead I decided to launch on my

00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:05,149
birthday this year for the past year

00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:09,019
before I'd been working on an app called

00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:10,850
caliber which is a quality and

00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:13,879
performance telemetry suite for the web

00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:15,230
it runs on chrome or uses chrome

00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:18,529
devtools everything the chrome dev tools

00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:19,970
can get caliber runs it runs against

00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:21,529
your site every day or when you hit the

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:24,639
API and it gives you metrics about your

00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:29,749
side like how quickly first paint was

00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:32,659
what your CSS like quality is like what

00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:34,100
your secret codes videos every time your

00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,840
site loads so that you can compare them

00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,090
and like look at screenshots of how long

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,590
it took something to render or maybe you

00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,929
can blame a third party for their ads

00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,100
being slow so I've been working on this

00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:45,919
for a long time if you want to check it

00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,440
out later it's caliber optical but I

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,119
launched it on my birthday and it was

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,919
the best birthday ever just for the next

00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:53,840
like eight hours I just watched my phone

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,980
be like retweeting and people saying hey

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,619
congratulations you launch something

00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:02,659
that's really cool so when you guys to

00:32:57,619 --> 00:33:04,669
do that too this is one of my favorite

00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:07,700
quotes by then period been period worked

00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:09,860
on supply which later sold to eBay which

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,019
I think he was maybe not so proud of

00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,999
after because they did nothing with it

00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:16,700
they didn't ship it so I'm gonna kill a

00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:18,139
kitten for that he said as a creative

00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,259
person you've been given the ability to

00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:24,039
build things by from nothing by the way

00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:26,299
of hard work over long periods of time

00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:29,570
creation is deeply personal and

00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:32,869
rewarding and it means that your work

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:35,720
should be rewarding as well and if it's

00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:37,399
not then something's wrong right we're

00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,110
spending all these hours working on a

00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:40,909
computer typing in staring at this

00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:45,710
goddamn screen we should be enjoying

00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:47,809
that our jobs are pretty great and as a

00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,260
creative person you need to understand

00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:51,300
yourself

00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,040
I don't think you can underestimate

00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:56,610
imports of understanding what motivates

00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,650
you as a person and then working on that

00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,760
and self analyzing and getting better at

00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:03,180
understanding the way that your brain

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,130
works you got to figure out what makes

00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:08,970
you tick you got to figure out how to

00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:13,679
ship and as you do it you should repeat

00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:18,980
and you should get better you should

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,790
make friends kind of hard sometimes and

00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,580
depression isn't really talked about a

00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:25,139
lot in our industry and like I said you

00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,020
and yourself a loner the master of your

00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:29,220
own mental state but you can help your

00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,460
friends and you can help your colleagues

00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:37,190
and not to mention minority groups as

00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,190
well in short be better than you are

00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:45,380
your career is long make it count make

00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,850
it enjoyable and motor your career on

00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,399
work that is not necessarily going to

00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:52,290
make you famous or rich but just work on

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,540
stuff that makes you happy iterate on

00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,240
that and when you succeed then worry

00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,310
about money it will come because if you

00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:06,270
don't it'll leave you hollow believe you

00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:07,920
mum sometimes you need to quit there's

00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,870
been many situations through my career

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,520
where I've worried about a situation

00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,830
with a client or with you know when I

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,100
worked for companies where I hated every

00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,630
day I regretted waking up I regret it

00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,100
going to the office I regretted having

00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,750
to work with that person that I didn't

00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:28,200
like that didn't understand me because

00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:34,980
I'm special and then you quit it all

00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:38,010
disappears everything can be great be

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:40,110
ambitious if I had followed through my

00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,610
career the old adage of if you're not

00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,430
good at something don't ever give it

00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,270
away for free I don't you start on

00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,970
amazing opportunities to meet people

00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,440
have to work on projects and you know

00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:51,759
particularly becoming like sort of

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,569
friends with my heroes

00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:56,949
I've always believed that sort of going

00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:59,589
from the gut that I'm doing the thing

00:35:56,949 --> 00:36:00,969
that is the right thing to do and there

00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:05,169
are times are out straight away from

00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:09,999
that path for a project or a particular

00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:13,299
job sometimes your money working

00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:14,109
blissfully is really important and while

00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:16,289
there are times that you're going to

00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:20,559
have to suck it up and just do your job

00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:22,659
those should be exceptions so if I had

00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,119
any advice for me comments to our

00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:26,469
industry or any creative pursuit I'd say

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,099
figure out what's important to you and

00:36:26,469 --> 00:36:32,039
strive to get there and don't be afraid

00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:34,239
to do what people will tell you stupid

00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,889
because if I had done that I would never

00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:37,749
build all these ridiculous things that

00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:40,389
have actually done more for my career

00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:42,819
and more for me enjoying working with

00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:44,559
people and learning from people then I

00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:46,089
had ever done in my commercial career if

00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,130
I had just done the commercial thing I

00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:49,209
don't know where what I'd be doing I

00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:54,519
probably would have quit by now

00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:56,289
completely asleep so believe in yourself

00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:59,589
and trust yourself and you'll build

00:36:56,289 --> 00:37:02,619
incredible things do work that makes you

00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:05,709
feel good start an event promote good

00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:10,559
work make friends encouraged them have a

00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:10,559
really good time thank

00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,910
