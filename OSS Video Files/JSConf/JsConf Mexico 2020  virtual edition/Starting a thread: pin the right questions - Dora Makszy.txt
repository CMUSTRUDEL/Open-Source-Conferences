Let me prepare senior developers for the questions of the juniors, that I’ve asked through my personal development journey. How to encourage them to ask, or even realise that there might be a question. See, how to notice if they’re stuck, and make their learning path easier.
Captions: 
	00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,960
and

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,040
i'm starting a thread by pinning the

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,960
right questions

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,639
let me show you what i have on my

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,080
tailored table

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,199
i have the perfect material the right

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,560
tools with which i will make some

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,160
adjustments

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,160
to have the final piece

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,720
about the material let me introduce

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,119
myself

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,239
i'm working as a team leader for a bunch

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,520
of developers

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,399
designers and qa engineers we have

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,760
discussions

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,000
together with our stakeholders therefore

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,120
i'm acting as a project manager a

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,640
business analyst

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,320
and the ui designer at once this is my

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,920
professional life

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,039
but in my private life i do love suing

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,160
i'm a wannabe seamstress and

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:02,320
well i'm a maximalist

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,440
but what i wanted i wanted to understand

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,519
the developers

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
to be able to translate the business

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,840
needs to them

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,960
and wise words so i needed a common

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,360
language

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,240
i realized that the common language

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,439
should be

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,720
coding i should learn to code

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,119
this way i'll have to achievement i will

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,560
have

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,759
two achievements at once i can become a

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
better leader

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,759
and i will have an application that

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,400
helps in optimizing

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,880
the amount of material for my hobby

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,880
project

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,479
but i failed i started with googling

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,439
how to learn to code and the majority of

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,560
the results

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,600
were boot camps these boot camps started

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,079
with explaining

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
pure mathematical theory instead of

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,240
giving real-life

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,360
examples and naming good tools

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,240
this is the point where i stopped i

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,439
realized

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,320
that i need to know myself

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,439
what kind of person i am as the previous

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,479
example shows

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,759
i'm a practical one i realized that i

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,400
needed to change

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,400
something if the internet gives

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,360
theoretical solutions

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
i need somebody who will directly tell

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,400
me

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:26,319
what to do in practice and why

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,319
so i needed a mentor and

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,319
here you come into the picture

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,160
who are you you are a developer

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,280
an engineer an architect attack

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,040
genius basically you are god

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,480
to me but you are also a human being

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,680
so i am able to ask questions

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,800
and you can answer therefore you are

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,800
also a mentor

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:04,959
let me share a few examples what kind of

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:08,159
discussions did we have with my mentor

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,040
for example which hardware to use

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,480
i have a laptop everybody can write

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,159
codes on a laptop but

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,480
okay which software to use my mentor

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,400
answered download this and this and

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,360
definitely that

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,120
okay but why those what's the connection

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,799
what is the logic behind

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,680
and he answered as a mentor

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,799
you should prepare to answer low level

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,360
questions

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,159
those questions that are so easy and

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,239
simple

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,200
that you might think that they won't

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,400
ever come up

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
well they will

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,400
after we had everything set up and

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,799
before we started

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
actual coding we had an interesting

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,319
topic

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,319
my mentor asked me what do you expect

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,319
from developing your application

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,200
and i told him well i want an

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,760
application

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
to know the proper amount of material

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,319
for suing you know

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,640
okay but what do you measure exactly he

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,519
asked me

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,160
to be able to plan the project my mentor

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,880
asked

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,759
specifically and refined each and every

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,880
question

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,000
until he had his proper answers

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,479
as a mentor you need to ask

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,880
specifically so you will get the right

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,840
answers

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,600
let me summarize what we had up until

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,199
this point

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,240
i had an idea i got help in selecting

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,360
the proper tools

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,759
to be able to develop that idea

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,880
during the setup we had this discussions

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,919
and based on those questions and answers

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,280
we were able to plan what exactly to be

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,600
developed

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,479
my mentor asked me to write down a

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,880
simple list

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,560
of mathematical functions that i need to

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,520
calculate

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
for the proper amount of material on

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,240
paper

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,120
and based on that plan on the list

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,759
on the paper we were able to build up

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,240
the architecture of the future

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,240
project

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,280
after initiation and the first lines of

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,199
code

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,199
we made a few iterations

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,400
as a mentor you will think together

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,120
continuously with your mentees

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,600
during these sessions both of you will

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,240
ask

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,320
questions and based on those you will be

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,680
able to advise

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,560
and again and again and again

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,199
this is a repetitive cycle let me

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,840
summarize the process

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,600
first you will assess the situation

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,520
where are your mentees

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,120
which are the missing key points to

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,680
start

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,400
you will be able to tell what kind of

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,919
people they

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,440
are either they will accept

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,720
theoretical approach or they rather like

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,080
practical approach based on what you see

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,400
about them and how they ask you will be

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,039
able to show direction

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,759
they will be able to achieve milestones

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,160
and smaller and bigger successes

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,960
it's very important to encourage them

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,080
continuously

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,400
what else should you think about you

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,160
should help with the proper stack

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,880
my mentor advised to use react as for my

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,919
aims

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,479
and my personal habit it fits the best

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,680
it provided steep learning curve and i

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,800
could experience

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,800
success very quickly it motivated

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,000
me to run faster you should highlight

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,800
the importance of documentation mentees

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,759
can get answers for the answer for their

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
questions

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,120
if they know what to search for and how

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,360
to read

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,400
functional specification and other

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,639
documents

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,160
they will learn what to include into

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,280
their documentation

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,919
and how to master it finally

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,560
and almost most importantly you should

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,960
tell them

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,919
about the code review you should do it

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,080
together

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,039
so that you can constantly provide good

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,360
examples

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,560
highlight alternatives but avoid

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,560
criticism

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,560
you should always be constructive

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,440
one more important topic here mentors

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,160
should be aware of the hidden questions

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,000
if you hear the following sentences from

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,160
your mentees

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,160
there is too much information no

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,879
direction no proper answer

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,440
i don't know even where to start or

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,960
anything

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,800
at all you can suspect

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,800
that something is missing

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,879
so what you can do is to come up with

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,080
analogies

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,160
and real-life examples for the very same

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,560
thing that you've just covered

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,759
so your mentees will be able to

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,039
understand

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,919
understand it in another way

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,039
ask your mentees to describe what

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,560
they've learned

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,560
but with their own words

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,840
if they can visualize it they will

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,319
understand it

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,039
this discussion was also between me and

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,039
my mentor

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,000
that's when i realized that

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,680
if i cannot clarify those details

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,640
then some question should be asked

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,000
and based on that hidden question and

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,720
the context

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,959
you as a mentor will be able to fill the

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,440
gap

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,640
now let's see why is it good to be a

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,399
mentor

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,040
what's in it for you you will gain

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,839
new skills you will face professional

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,800
challenges

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,519
and during these you will solve problems

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,000
while you show empathy

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,279
you will face the fact that as there are

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,519
different people

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,279
there are different ways of thinking and

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,080
different perspectives

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,240
and there will be a logical explanation

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,560
for each and every of them

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,240
by explaining how to use the existing

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,279
solutions or tools

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,279
and by experiencing new solutions you

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,800
will be able to show guidance

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,200
where to turn next and most importantly

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,040
during this process you will understand

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,240
and respect each other

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:47,600
so you will have mutual trust

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,600
this is huge please take it seriously

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,720
now the final piece consists

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,720
of the result what i had at the end of

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,120
my first development journey

00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,920
and also the key benefits what you can

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,560
take away

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,800
after this presentation

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,800
i am now able to speak the common

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,200
language with my developers

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,360
i gain their trust and we have mutual

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,240
respect towards each other

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,279
you will have the same it is a symbiotic

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,320
relationship

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,320
both parties can turn to each other you

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,519
will have a promising new talent

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,839
to talk to and i

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,160
now have an application at hand that

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,360
helps me in optimizing the proper amount

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,839
of material

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:40,560
for my hobby what i wanted

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:43,680
i wanted to calculate

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,959
from the material

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:51,519
where i could give the material with

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,519
the neck width the neck height

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,640
the chest width

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:05,760
the waist width nah it would be too much

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,920
yeah this is better

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,519
okay a more realistic hip width and arm

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,880
circumference

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:20,399
and arm length

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,880
full length of the upper clothing

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,240
and the general seam with which you will

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,720
be able to end

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,600
the shirt now i can see that

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,079
bit more than two meters of material i

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,079
will need

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,680
okay what's next for me

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,360
i definitely have several ideas how to

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,480
broaden the functionality of my

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,720
application

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,639
and i want to practice because i'm

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,920
aiming for more

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,399
what's next for you you will be able to

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,200
think

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,320
as a beginner and now know where to

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,040
start

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
also you will be able to recognize the

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,320
pattern

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:12,399
of hidden questions and be able to show

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,399
where the same from another view

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:23,839
