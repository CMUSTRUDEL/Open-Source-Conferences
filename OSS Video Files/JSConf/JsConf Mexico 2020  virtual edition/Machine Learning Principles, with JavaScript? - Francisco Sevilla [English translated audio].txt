	00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,720
we're going to talk about

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,920
javascript a little bit of machine

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,160
learning

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,719
i'm going to highlight a little bit

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,360
because i want to focus of the process

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,840
and

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,880
what you need to learn as an individual

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,720
and as a

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,760
machine to to learn and have javascript

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,359
have evolved from the first step

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,640
and until now and anything that we can

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,040
do with javascript

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,800
with no further ado well let's talk

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,399
about the beginning

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,120
but before that the expectations of this

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,840
talk

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,960
what is and what is not this talk i

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,320
would like to

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,960
clarify that you are not in front of an

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,680
expert of machine learning i'm not a

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,079
data

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,440
scientist i'm not a mathematician i'm

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,000
not in the

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,520
machine learning area but i'm a passion

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,280
my passion is this

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,239
so the objective is to land

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,240
this machine learn of this concept of

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,000
all and every one of us can

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,760
understand so we are not

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,280
afraid with this topic so we can start

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,240
talking about this

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,360
issue and and this is not like

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,960
overwhelming

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,680
so this is not an expert as i said a

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
scientific

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,200
mathematician it's not a session where

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,240
we are going to

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,640
create or design our own learning

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,200
models but i hope that with this talk

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,320
we can learn a little bit of a basic

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,439
concept

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,560
the first things of javascript

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:48,560
in this area and to play a little bit in

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:54,720
with this topic to understand

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:58,479
what javascript had advanced

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,399
basic concept and simple notions

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,280
play a little bit with machine learning

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,280
with javascript

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,720
and it's a talk that is something that

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,920
loves this topic dedicates a little time

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,640
at night and i try to learn about this

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,080
area

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,400
and to share this knowledge with you

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,440
so that's it this these are like the

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
agenda

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,720
so something that is like very

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,120
that is frightening and it's a along

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,319
with the history of javascript

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,680
with this 25 years more or less

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,360
so if we want to understand something we

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,879
need to know where

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,920
start so as uh some cartoons i would

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,000
like to quote

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:50,000
this character we start from the origin

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,319
so our end starts with the origin so

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,959
javascript is like that since the

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,680
beginning the origins when netscape was

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,599
cool

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,159
more than one of you don't know what

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,400
netscape is internet explorer was

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,319
emerging in those times

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,800
i'm talking about 1995 or 96 where the

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,840
web development was well you know it's

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,640
it's another story so

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,319
javascript started there the origins the

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,959
first stages and

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,760
but currently or nowadays it's

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,640
everywhere

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,560
javascript is now everywhere wherever

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,920
you turn around is there

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,159
so if we're talking web development and

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,360
mobile apps

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,840
desktop apps so

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,280
maybe many of you you don't know that

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,519
you are using these

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,480
apps and for sure is as criticized as

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,920
the other days

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,239
but they don't know that they are using

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,040
in the communication for example in

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
slack or

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,280
development those tools that are in

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,519
javascript

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,879
so we are using it on a daily basis

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,680
so it's part of our job

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,280
talking about the server this is a boom

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,400
in the last years

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,920
through iots why

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,959
don't you think that gs is in this area

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,160
iot

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,479
in the internet of things so javascript

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,400
is

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,720
here that small library or

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,440
language data started with script

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,199
language

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:33,360
or a small validation forms

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:37,360
or little by little was gaining

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,560
land and burning or buried

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,840
flash comparing what is today

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,880
well it's not there anymore

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,960
and javascript has dominated or

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,320
continued dominating so this is the

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,360
evolving so

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,000
right now we are using for things that

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,600
we're not

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,120
thinking as machine learning so

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,120
in my opinion and not because i'm a fan

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,440
a fanatic of marvel movies java's script

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,320
is

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,120
something like i'm sharing in this in

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,560
this

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,759
slide and i'm going to this serum that

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,960
is you're looking in this

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,320
slide because quoting this movie we are

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,080
talking about

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,960
that in the correct hands

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,400
if it's a good person for example i'm

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,199
quoting the movie

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,800
it's it's ten times better that if it's

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,080
an in a bad hands

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,560
so javascript is so permissible and

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:42,400
evolved and gaining areas

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,680
do this in a very well

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,720
hands developer that is taking care of

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,360
good practices

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
and code there's a lot of potential so

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
that's what

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,919
and again because it's permissible and

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,000
in the same time in the wrong hands it

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,800
can create a code

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,919
that will not be proud of but this is

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,360
javascript

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,960
in in a nutshell and

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,479
this skill or disability

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,560
is is there so this is uh

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,000
the topic today machine learning and

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,880
javascript that

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,520
a few years ago we didn't see it like

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,160
that

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,479
so machine learning and javascript

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,120
before starting with this

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,919
area i would like to talk just machine

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,440
learning

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,639
what we think it is what is what we

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,840
feel it is and this depends

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,680
of the context and the perspective of

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,639
each person if we if we think that this

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,759
is not part of

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,720
us so we can think that or

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,160
be afraid of the use or the potential of

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,360
machine learning

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,400
but if we if we think what it is

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,199
is maybe something complicated or

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,680
revolutionary the world so two of those

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,960
things can be true

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,599
so how a non-technical people

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,880
think it is this machine learning we

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,240
talk about this

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,800
fight good versus evil

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,720
dominating the world through computers

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,720
and i repeat

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,759
we can say or we can see like a drastic

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,120
scenario

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,160
but no we it's not

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,240
as afraid as this and it's because we

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,160
are not

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,440
understanding the topic or

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,360
aspects of the topic so personally i

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,840
think that yes there are some

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,479
destruction of the world that comes from

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,840
the

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,240
uh intelligence are

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,199
artificial intelligence but it's not

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,199
like this

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,560
this this slide is more like the human

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:59,759
behavior and modifying

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,759
the way the human thing things

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,960
and to think that maybe we are

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,960
getting ideas through the

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,759
ai it's it's not so different as

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,520
the social media so machine learning is

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,720
not a futuristic

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,479
topic is right now with us

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,840
so let's see what we can do as the first

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,080
steps with machine learning and

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,199
javascript

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,919
apparently i understand that as an

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,120
audience is not only from mexico

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,159
argentina peru

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,599
colombia but if i use

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,240
a word that is different from your

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,519
spanish

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,080
i apologize in advance so

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,959
machine learning is not so different

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,640
what we

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:53,760
are seeing in this screen

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,160
we are teaching the computing as when we

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,080
were

00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,120
in the elementary school we have a data

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,760
enter what is this and we tell the

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,440
machine

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,560
what it is so the difference between

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,120
what it looks like and what it feels is

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,399
a

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,680
huge my objective or goal

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,640
in this talk is you can feel as simple

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,880
as this

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:24,000
the processes the knowledge

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,600
process as easy as this slide

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,880
so let's think our learning process

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,080
this process is very simple

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,200
we ask a question and we think

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,320
in possible solutions or scenarios

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,440
so what we do is uh filter

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,959
or define that set

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,000
of words filter what is what

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,800
what is interest of us and

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,920
those patterns and then we start to

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,120
iterate

00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,399
to know if our theory is correct or not

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,600
according to the new uh enter

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,399
so finally when we say i

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,480
learn is because i can decide what is

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,519
correct and what what is not correct

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,360
that is a learning process and again is

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,560
the same as a computer

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,320
so let's do a small exercise

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,959
i will guide you to validate that this

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,320
machine learning process is just the

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,680
same as the

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,000
human learning process so we can

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,839
understand a new topic a new

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,880
programming learning a new language etc

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,720
so this is not different

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,680
of my process so what is the computer

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,560
doing

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,640
is the same we ask the question and we

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,560
will try to answer the question and

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,959
possible solution

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,600
list of possible outcomes of solution

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,440
filtered

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,320
at least identify patterns from those

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,120
we are going to iterate to identify more

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,560
patterns

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,959
among the solution so to identify that

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,320
patterns we are going to repeat

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:12,640
the that output as a new input

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:16,720
until we arrive to a final solution

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:21,200
eventually we consider that we learned

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,320
and if we present this in a visual

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,600
form we have a raw

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,120
set of data without processing and

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,480
then we filter what we are interested in

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,720
for example history perfect let's

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:42,320
focus in a location or uh

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:46,240
or a year or a couple of years so

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:50,720
those will be the structures sata that

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,760
they are not raw data they are not event

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,279
now is uh filter set

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,519
data according to our interests then we

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,720
analyze

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:06,079
and with that we have this new candidate

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,120
model so with the things i

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,320
know right now and if they ask me

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,959
they say i will answer like that so

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,519
that's why

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,800
it's a candidate model i need more data

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,000
and that's why

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:24,639
my answer will change as

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,320
more input i'll have so this is a

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,839
cycle process iterative process and each

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,880
input or output or a process will

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,240
become to our new cycle

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,680
so eventually with the number of

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,360
correct iteration we will have like a

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:49,279
golden model of the final model

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,839
so we are now okay with this model

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,399
and then we are going to connect the our

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,760
apps

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,279
to this model we are saying the app

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,240
if i have this input of data

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,680
eventually this will be the output and i

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,800
will be okay with that

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,920
output this is the process

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,639
how the the computer will learn

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,639
and it's the same as the human process

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,240
learning so at the

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,959
end the apps will connect to this model

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
so let's do it with this exercise let's

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,880
start

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,160
learning as in the same way as the

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,600
computer so

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,000
this is the exercise we have this word

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,040
offset we are going to learn how to

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,600
pronounce

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,680
some words in english so we're going to

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,360
filter for example

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,480
letter o remembering this

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,600
slide we are processing the raw data

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,600
to what we are interested in so i'm not

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,800
focusing in the english words but

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,839
just words that start with the o that's

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,880
my

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:02,639
filter data set that's my interest

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,320
area each iteration or each new word

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,519
will create a iteration and a cycle

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,120
so i will define

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:16,560
a cycle

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,560
so i will listen for example

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:24,000
a pronunciation with o and i say okay

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,639
o is pronounced in english like an o and

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
you

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,040
combine it so it's like o and that's my

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,240
model

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,519
is not a final model i just have one

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,639
word but my candidate model in the first

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,040
iteration is like that then then we will

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,240
have a second word

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,440
for example o plus r h

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,320
is similar like o

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,639
it's like the first one this means that

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,639
the

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,959
same model applies is correct

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,000
the one that i used to have in the other

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,120
iteration can

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,160
apply to this one so i understand

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,360
letter o it's a combination of

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,560
o u however

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,760
we have the third iteration

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:18,000
so o plus n is no o

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:21,360
plus u is on is more

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,279
like an a so my new model

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:29,120
will say well o plus n is between

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:32,639
o and a but anything else will be

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,680
o and u because in this three iteration

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,360
is what i know

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,240
i don't care about the rest of the word

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,800
until now i just have three examples so

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,079
if a

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:49,279
fourth word arrives i will try to

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,720
resolve or pronounce it

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:56,000
according with the first three examples

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,920
eventually i will learn that operation

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,199
is not like on no owner

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,680
oh so i have a new model and with this

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,720
model

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,839
i will learn so at the end

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,839
more and more words

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:17,040
i will have o o on operation

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,399
observe and i will have new data

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,600
with each new iteration the last

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,800
output will be the new cycle

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,600
input so my learning process is

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,320
as simple as that with this new word

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,800
word

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,079
i see the pronunciation i compare with

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,399
what i know

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:41,519
and i add it with my list

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,959
word catalog so i'm learning with

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,440
each example so at the end i will have

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,959
this

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:54,240
golden model and once i'm

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:54,240
okay with the rules and with this

00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,920
i'm also comfortable with my output

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,679
so right now my apps can use

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,919
this golden model with the sixth word of

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,240
the seventh of the eighth word i will

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,839
say

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:15,039
yes is uh all with a t

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,400
or other other rules that i'm

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:21,360
learning in the process i can predict

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,240
that this word will be pronounced like

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,400
that

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,400
so this is the learning process

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:34,799
and as i'm sure that is the

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:39,760
learning process that all of us

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:42,799
have when we want to learn anything

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,320
a language or another thing

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:49,360
and let's see models help

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,480
us to predict this means

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,600
that they have a percentage of error or

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,360
a mistake so what they do is with

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,400
all these data i think that my i put

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,559
or my exit is like this let's

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,559
think as a user or as a

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,480
like facebook or twitter or google

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,160
can give us different answers or

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,960
suggestions for example friends

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,919
suggestion

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,880
according where we are or our last

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,280
searches

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,280
or what we did yesterday

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,320
maybe what we ate last night so with

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,600
this or we can predict

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,880
what can be important for us

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:43,840
in a certain day and

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,840
artificial intelligence is not

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,640
an exchanger of what we are doing

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,919
and why is the world changing because

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:57,039
there are ways of thinking

00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,000
that well trying to

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,120
tell us that are our own thoughts but

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,559
it's not like that

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,600
is because they predict very

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,799
effectively according to our

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,600
searches our friends that we are

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,320
reading their post and other decisions

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,840
so

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,919
how this works i think that

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,280
even the creator of this model doesn't

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,400
know but

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:28,160
the point here is what a model

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,520
does is to predict very accurately

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,559
or as accurately as it can the

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,080
the solution of the question

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:42,080
some weeks ago i think many of

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,840
you could saw this presentation

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,840
and i want to highlight about this

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,200
presentation is when

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,240
share or explain this chip

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,280
implanted in different animals i think

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,480
three or four pigs that

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,880
they implanted those chips

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:06,320
so the simple process

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,679
to implant a chip in the brain of a

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,039
human or a living being and to

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,559
extract it without harming this

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:20,000
living being is a success

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:23,440
and to extract information

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,200
due to these nervous

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:31,120
terminals is huge let's imagine

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:35,120
implant ideas or thoughts

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,559
this inception term can apply

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,080
and maybe we are heading

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:45,440
towards this but for me right now it's

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,320
amazing just to read data from example

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,520
to read

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,640
those thoughts of our living being

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:57,120
so as you can see in this slide

00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,559
this chart represent is

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,440
through the nervous terminals they can

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,960
predict

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,240
the movement of the peak maybe

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,520
to where the the leg

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,799
of the pig will be in the land

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,960
to predict that use and

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:22,960
this was in real time and the reading

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:26,000
and the prediction that that leg will be

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,640
each articulation

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,600
will be function so what you see is a

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,360
prediction

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,960
versus what happened in reality

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,080
again just forget the

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,799
the reading or other things just

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:48,400
think in in the apps for example

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,360
somebody that has an accident

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,360
and can't walk

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:59,360
can think about the movements so why

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,400
don't connect

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,440
to just go beyond

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,880
that part that prevent that person to

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,400
walk and eventually

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:14,159
can move with these

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,799
terminals nervous terminals to do a

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,240
bypass

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:21,760
so we can predict in a satisfactory

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,480
way how the leg can be moved

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,480
so these implementations just this

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,480
implementation to read the data

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:38,080
not to incept things

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,120
just apps to predict

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,360
something like this presentation

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:48,400
for me it's uh amazing enough

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,080
to want to know the next step in this

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,960
technology

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,919
this uh was something that caught my

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,360
attention and it's just to highlight

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,360
just two predictions

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:06,559
uh a model does not warranty

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:10,320
the output of data just predict

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:14,080
the output according to the input

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,799
now to arrive to implementation there's

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,159
a lot of libraries in javascript so

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,679
let's focus on this

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:25,120
topic there's one that we are

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:28,159
tensorflow gs

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:31,679
and tensorflow.js is not the same one

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:35,520
is based on the other and tensorflow.js

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:39,360
is this library for javascript that

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:42,000
allowed us to learn models and to train

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,960
models and to arrive to that golden

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,279
models through

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,840
javascript so the advantage of

00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,039
tensorflow.js

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:55,279
we can do a lot of from the browser and

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:59,520
a server they have a

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:02,799
catalog of existing models

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,159
very extensive models

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:09,679
so we can just use it import it

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:13,120
and start working with them and teach

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:16,080
this model so we do not have to

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,559
develop our own models if you remember

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,080
at the beginning was different

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:25,760
but we can play with this library

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,039
if these models are already existing we

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,720
can use it

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:33,600
and at the end this library allows

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,360
or determinants a percentage of

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,480
coincidence

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,320
so this is tensorflow.js

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,320
and what we

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,600
learning or we start at the beginning of

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,440
this talk is

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,400
this uh topic or concept of machine

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,000
learning

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,720
without being an expert in this

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,679
so this is what is interesting of

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,679
javascript

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:04,799
how far arrives and how

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,440
we can implement in some

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,120
areas that some years ago we just said

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,480
no that's not possible

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,840
so this example of the chip

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,720
implanted in the in animals is just one

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,159
example

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,360
of that for me is

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:26,559
not as realistic according to my

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,840
abilities but it's there

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:33,279
so let's uh play a little bit more

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,960
more simple through with tensorflow.js

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:40,960
so what tensorflow.js is to prepare

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,159
the raw data again i will highlight

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,679
this learning process so we

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,000
define we create a candidate again

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,760
the pronunciation of the words that

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,799
start with o

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,000
maybe we just have

00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,159
like one or two correct words but

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,880
on with time we will have more and more

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,679
words so what we're doing is we're doing

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,720
is to train our candidate model

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,960
so with more word the model

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:16,559
will be more precise and eventually

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,600
will cover the majority of the scenarios

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,799
there were there will be some data

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,080
different they will not cover all the

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,520
cases that's not

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:31,760
the goal but just to apply

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:35,120
a model in the majority of the cases

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,600
and then validate the model so that's

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,960
the

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,400
percentage of the loss that

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:46,080
model can have and then we will

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,720
make our own prediction with these same

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,640
models

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,840
again an input of data we run the model

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:59,440
and then we will have a output

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,440
and with a percentage of precision

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,320
another small backup

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,240
to explain tensorflow

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:13,440
the origin of this library

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,000
tensor is mathematic

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,520
terms and i said at the beginning i

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,960
can't explain this i'm not a

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,279
mathematician

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,159
but in a practical example

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,120
with my level of knowledgement think

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,880
about

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:35,840
a boat in the ocean

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:39,600
and tensor represents

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,039
the water flow against the movement of

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,919
the boat

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,399
so when there is like a crash it's not

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,880
in an

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:52,640
opposite sense so it's like a hedge

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:56,399
that push the water so the boat

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,840
can continue flowing so that conversion

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:03,120
the sense of the water and the sense

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,320
or the direction of the boat in the

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,080
different

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,200
direction is a tensor

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,880
and a tensor in a data structure

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,520
is that value and then

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,159
converted in or transform it in a

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,039
different

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,000
output and then you can scale that

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:26,399
number

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
or maybe in an array or a matrix

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:33,120
that matrix is tensor and

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,840
start with and that's why is the name of

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,440
the library

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:43,840
i'm not i can't explain

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,960
the term but i can give you an example

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,440
that matrix

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,039
that structure that allowed me in an

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,520
input to transform it

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,080
and have a different output and with

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,360
this

00:28:52,080 --> 00:29:00,480
to have a prediction which is a

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,480
percentage of certainty of that output

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,039
with this having this in mind we

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,440
now we can have some exercise so let's

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,880
play

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,919
this library you can you can

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,440
have it with you through a cdn

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:22,320
with our reference of a library

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:26,000
online so what we are going to do

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,399
is work in a couple of examples so with

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,720
this

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:33,840
slide you will see a playground and

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,320
with this it shows like the graphic of

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,679
the

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,240
learning process with the input

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,799
data and eventually what we are looking

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,440
for is the output and the middle layer

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,039
that will

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,320
process or transform those data so

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,200
example if my input data

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,240
is horizontal and vertical what i the

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,919
prediction

00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:01,200
will be like in the center like a circle

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:04,240
this blue data and the exterior is

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:08,320
a yellow data

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,360
or orange and this will change

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,960
according to the input if this

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:18,000
data input is not in the same directions

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,880
it's just a lineal the model

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,559
will separate in this way there are two

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,919
categories

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:28,960
so half is blue points

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:32,000
or dots and the other half are

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,640
orange dots and this is important

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,640
because

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:41,039
represents or according to the data

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:44,159
input and the neurons that we have

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,159
is the predictions

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,440
this with this platform we can play

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,159
and will change according or what we

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,159
want to achieve

00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,960
and there will be some that the dots

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,559
outside these models

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,919
but it doesn't matter it's just

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:12,000
uh lost data but the percentage

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,720
continue to be higher enough so library

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,679
will create predictions again a

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,039
percentage

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:22,000
100 is because he's 100 sure

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,000
of the result

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:29,039
this is just a playground

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,559
what i'm interesting is know more about

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,080
this library

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,840
and with tensorflow we have more than

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,880
one example

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:44,159
to train existing models for example

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,360
in this case we can

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,919
learn the machine to know the difference

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,919
between

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,159
an automobile and a plane so through a

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,679
camera

00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:00,960
is like this defined two models

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:05,039
and to teach the computer that this is

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,200
a vehicle a car and the other is a plane

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:10,000
and at the end according one to the

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
other is

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,480
as the computer you will decide if it's

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,080
a car

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,240
or a plane maybe this is a very simple

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,279
example

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,720
comparing to predict how the animal

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,519
will walk but we need to

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,080
to start with something so this is the

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,399
data

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,240
input and then we will start with a

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,279
circle

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,399
receive the data learn

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,519
with every image we are

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:49,200
teaching the computer to

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:52,240
differentiate one object from the other

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,080
and once is ready or once

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:59,679
process all the images or i read all

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,720
the words that start with o then the

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,720
model is ready

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,960
when i for example in the second example

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,000
we'll know when i show them

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,760
another picture if this is i'm

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,320
100 this is a car or if 100

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,320
a plane and to change one with the other

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,679
so the library will define the

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,039
percentage

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:34,480
of certainty that our model has that is

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:38,000
just learned thanks to the images

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,440
so this iteration process

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,960
explained before continues capturing

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,120
data and says

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,600
this is a car this is a plane and with

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,240
this there are different applications

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,200
for example you can download in your

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,000
mobile

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,600
just just to know if the picture is a

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,640
hot dog or not

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,159
or with an images

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:06,480
you can will know if that thing is

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,720
you can hug if it's a dog or a cat

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,760
and of course there will be some

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,800
difference

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,240
according to the inputs for example

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,599
an image to know if it's a cat or a dog

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:23,599
and while it's learning i show an image

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:28,079
of a terra nova maybe says it's a bear

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:33,760
not a dog but with more and more images

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:37,440
the machine will learn like this example

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:41,040
so i invite you to play pac-man

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,960
with the ymca or images as we

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:48,399
just did where you say well

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,679
where is upstairs downstairs

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:55,280
right and left so you will run

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,640
a lot of libraries and you need to

00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,119
understand the main concepts which are

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,000
the process because we know the learning

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,040
process we

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,640
know that we have the library tensorflow

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,480
gs so we can create

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:14,079
our own app and use existing models

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,599
we can train this model and eventually

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:21,440
we can say that doc is uh

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:26,320
that kind of of a brand

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:28,480
so you can take a picture of a puppy

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,440
and we'll look in the different social

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,119
media if

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:36,320
somebody report that puppy has missed

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:45,839
with similar characteristics

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:45,839
and eventually say well there is

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,040
yes so from my part uh

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,440
we are okay with time so i'm finished my

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,040
talk

00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:01,760
and right now just ask yourself

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:04,320
a couple well a question and a challenge

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,240
so let's start playing with this library

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,440
this was a very simple

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,240
demo so took this demo to the next

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,240
step this will be like first one and the

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,280
second one is to answer this question so

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,760
what how machine learning help your

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,960
business or on a daily basis

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,400
so why use it in our business

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,200
well knowing these other concepts

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,839
and knowing the library that will

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,280
allowed

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:40,560
to reach different

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,280
levels why not javascript so this is

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,040
a question that i put on the table so if

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,320
you have any question

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,400
i'm here i hope that this will this is

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,079
an interesting topic

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,960
of course we are not going to be experts

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,200
but just to have like the first step of

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,000
machine learning and javascript so thank

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,000
