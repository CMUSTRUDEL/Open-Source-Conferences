	00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,680
um i think one of the

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,200
things that really excites me about web

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,679
performance is

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,240
you know if you follow people on twitter

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,679
you

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,880
see you know all these you know

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,359
web perf gods talking about

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,400
web performance and it seems like it's a

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,880
hard thing to do

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,840
but it's actually quite easy to become a

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,640
web performance

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,000
expert at least in your team and i want

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,960
to show you how today in just

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,920
some really easy steps so thank you so

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,399
much diego for the amazing introduction

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,559
like uh he said i'm i do a lot of things

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,800
i'm currently the ceo of this dot labs

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,039
we're a javascript consultancy

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,920
um so you know if you need any

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,199
javascript

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,079
related help or expertise uh we have

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,440
some of the most

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,280
amazing uh experts on our team and i

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,079
just love the community right so i'm

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,079
always involved

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,840
and i'm always happy to chat on twitter

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,680
at lady elite

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,439
so we're going to talk about a few

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,720
things today um

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,799
you know some of the things we're going

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,760
to talk about are just simply measuring

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,400
web performance

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,320
the right way also how to create a

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,560
simple foundation for web performance

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,159
and what you should be thinking about

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,920
we'll also be talking about how to

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,240
accurately measure web performance in

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,680
devtools and lighthouse

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,520
and then also go through some key

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,240
lighthouse metrics and then i'm going to

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,159
leave you with two just really easy web

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,400
fixes that you can simply do when you're

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,159
asleep which i love

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,680
so let's talk about what perf

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,600
so you might have already you know

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,079
opened up chrome devtools at one point

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,720
in time

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,439
and ran a lighthouse report but there is

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,320
just

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,079
so much to understand and if you do that

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,799
without kind of knowing how to

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,680
set things up you could potentially be

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,600
giving

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,680
getting misleading metrics right so

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,200
let's go ahead and get started

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,880
the first thing you want to do even

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,680
before you start measuring

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,520
is make sure you understand your users

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,280
and your customers

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,719
alex russell who is known for web

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,800
performance at google

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,479
he recommends that you look at the high

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
percentiles of slowness for your

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,120
customers

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,239
and if you can't get good population

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,360
level data

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,360
then assume you're making tech for the

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,360
disenfranchised

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,440
so once you decide on a specific

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,440
demographic that you're optimizing for

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,280
right then it's really important to kind

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,720
of start creating your foundation

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,560
for web performance so the first thing

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,920
you need to do is just make sure you

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,440
define your goals it's super important

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,280
to measure the right

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,319
thing and every company has different

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,959
goals don't let other metrics define you

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,800
or define what your goals are or what

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,400
you're optimizing for

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,239
the second thing you want to do right

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,200
once you know what you want to do

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,800
is create a baseline set of metrics that

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,920
is so you have something to actually

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,680
measure from

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,680
and then what you can do is decide which

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,400
levers you want to move on and what

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
numbers you want to improve

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,599
the third thing is going to be making

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,319
sure you're measuring across multiple

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,239
devices

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,080
right you never just want to measure on

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,519
your machine if you don't have access to

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,360
multiple devices

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,519
uh tools like chrome dev tools for

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,440
example allow you to simulate various

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,959
devices which comes in really handy

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
and then you know this is a lot it might

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,760
seem

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,200
like a lot to think about right and

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,280
maybe you can't get enough

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
data on that or maybe you just want to

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,560
start somewhere so if you just do need

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,000
to start somewhere

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,360
then just assume you're building tech

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,360
for the disenfranchised

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,280
so now that you've you know created a

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,440
foundation

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,280
you're ready to get started so let's go

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,280
ahead and get measuring

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,480
um in these next few slides i'm going to

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,599
walk through kind of

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,680
what we typically measure um

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,200
when we measure the performance of sites

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,360
across the web

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,239
a lot of what i'm showing you is kind of

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,879
like

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,959
unofficial or official industry standard

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,480
and a lot of what i'm showing you also

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,920
is based on opinions that we have formed

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,760
based on the work that we've done at

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,200
this dot

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,360
so let's talk about just simply

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,519
effectively measuring web performance

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,919
using chrome dev tools in lighthouse

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,040
there's definitely a few steps that most

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,520
don't consider

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,520
before measuring performance and before

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,600
running a lighthouse report

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,600
so let's go ahead and go through this

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
first so the first thing you want to do

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
is make sure that you

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,040
are opening your production application

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,240
not dab not local

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
in an incognito window and this is uh

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,000
really key to making sure that any

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,560
extensions are not getting in the way

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
of your measurements and also making

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,919
sure you know you're testing best for

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,199
what a user would see or

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,479
a user experience would be the next

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,479
thing you want to do is you want to

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,919
change the device you're measuring

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,199
in dev tools to moto g4 this tends to be

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,880
the industry standard

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,639
from what i've seen when running

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,639
performance benchmarks on sites

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,320
so next up you also want to make sure

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,680
you're throttling your network right

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,400
i mean of course your site is going to

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,039
be fast on a high-speed connection

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,880
but this is not typical of a lot of the

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,479
users out in the wild

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,600
so you need to make sure to throttle

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,160
your network speed to 3g

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,360
and then uh you know most people are not

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,120
running on

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,120
super computers that some of you may be

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,560
developing on so making sure you're

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,479
throttling your cpu down to 4x slowdown

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,840
so that you can accurately benchmark

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,840
your site out in the wild

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,160
now another thing to really remember is

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,800
that you need to make sure you're also

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,520
disabling your cash in the network tab

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,440
otherwise your site is just going to

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,280
it'll be cached and it will just appear

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,960
faster than it really is

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,319
for users who have never been to your

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,440
site right

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,479
now after this step finally you're ready

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,319
to get started measuring so hit refresh

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,199
and then that way you can hit your site

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,520
with no caching

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,120
and after all of this is set up right

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,360
and you have all your settings right

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,400
um now you can accurately run a

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,600
lighthouse report

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,160
that's going to give you a realistic

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,440
benchmark and or also run other

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,319
performance tests within your within

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,319
chrome devtools

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:31,360
so here's all the steps again to follow

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,520
before you actually begin measuring

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,720
in dev tools and lighthouse

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,639
so now that you've run a lighthouse

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,080
report the next question is

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,680
how on earth do you understand those

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,199
metrics in your report right so i'm

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,280
going to just walk you through a few of

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,000
those key lighthouse metrics

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,360
um here are six of them so we have first

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,520
contentful paint

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,919
largest contentful paint cumulative

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,160
layout shift that's one of my favorites

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,039
um total blocking time time to

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,160
interactive

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,960
and also the speed index

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,919
so a lot of this content is really

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,520
amazing

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,960
in terms of what you know google and

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,800
um mozilla have provided for us as

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,440
developers out there

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,520
um but you know if you want to learn

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,960
more about some of these things

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,000
make sure to check out uh web.dev

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,440
i put it below as well um

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,280
in the last little section right here

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,960
you'll see it um so that you can find

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,880
out a little bit more about

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,319
these different metrics another great

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,639
thing about it is that

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,039
uh you know the documentation goes into

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,479
a lot of detail it's like multiple pages

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,479
per metric so it's it's really useful

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,440
so the first one is first contentful

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,479
paint right and i put the description

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,879
uh that web.tab gives you over here but

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,479
really first contentful paint is simply

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,840
how long is it going to take before a

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,520
user actually sees

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,120
anything right and one thing to remember

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,639
when you're looking at your first

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,639
contentful paint is

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:07,440
it should be within 1.5 seconds

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,120
um that's what uh google and lighthouse

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,720
recommend

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,800
the second one is going to be largest

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,680
contentful paint

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,520
and basically this one is hey how long

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,520
is it going to be before a user actually

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,080
sees the largest thing that loads on

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,000
your page

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,840
in the viewport right which is you know

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,800
supposedly the most important thing

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,960
right

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,039
um so this should actually occur within

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,560
two and a half seconds of a page

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:35,839
starting to load and you know uh

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,560
google recommends that you have a

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,159
threshold to measure like the 75th

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,479
percentile basically

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,000
um of page loads and segmenting that

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,279
across mobile and desktop devices

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,640
cumulative layout shift as well um again

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,680
i think this is one of my favorites

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,279
because

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,800
uh you might not think about this but

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,600
basically any time the browser has to

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,480
resize

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,760
or move or recalculate layouts on a page

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,519
right it's obviously not a great

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,399
experience for the user to see things

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,040
like jumping around on a page um but

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,800
also

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,080
it's hindering your performance because

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,080
you're having to

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,800
like make the browser do work for you

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,320
right so your cls score should be

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,160
less than 0.1

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,720
and again just me making sure that

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,920
you're measuring the 75th percentile of

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,000
page loads

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,040
um and doing this across mobile and

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,040
desktop devices

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,800
time to interactive um this

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,640
is going to be just the amount of time

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,920
your site takes to allow users to

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,800
interact with it

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,800
so making sure you're minimizing the

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,320
difference between that first contentful

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,480
paint the first time somebody sees

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,480
anything on your page

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,560
between that and the time to interactive

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,160
because one thing you don't want is for

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,600
people to see things on your page but

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,279
then try to click something and it

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,000
doesn't work right because the time to

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,480
interactive is not there so making sure

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,360
that

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,680
fcp and tti are like in sync with each

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,680
other

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,519
total blocking time so total blocking

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,800
time is simply like

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,079
the difference between the first

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,959
contentful pain and the time to

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,120
interactive

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,240
again it's that waiting time that you

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,760
have right

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,600
so how long does the user have to wait

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,560
again before like they see something on

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,079
the page and then

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,680
they're able to actually interact with

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,160
it um

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,519
sites should always make sure to have a

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,079
total blocking time of

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,959
less than 300 milliseconds when they're

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,079
testing on

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,079
average mobile hardware

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,800
and last but not least is going to be

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,640
speed index so

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,079
this is simple it's just how fast does

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,240
your site actually look

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,519
right you should aim for a speed of

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,880
index of between 0 and 4.3 seconds

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,800
and that will give you a lighthouse

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,920
score of between 75

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,440
to 100. so

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,800
hopefully going over some of these

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,000
metrics in lighthouse help you

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,320
understand better like

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
what performance metrics are important

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,720
in your application

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,839
and what you can start looking for today

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,920
that being said there's also super easy

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,200
things you can do to improve web perf if

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,440
i had

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,040
a longer talk i would go through so many

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
but i'm just going to give you two that

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,320
like you can literally probably do in

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,160
your sleep right

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,399
so the top two things i want to focus on

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,839
are just large images and unused

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,399
javascript so images if you look

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,120
for web performance content out there i

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,360
swear

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,200
maybe 75 percent of it is just talking

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,240
about images right

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,399
um unoptimized images are a huge

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,600
problem that is making the web really

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,079
slow

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,079
um the great part about lighthouse it

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,160
actually tells you how big your images

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,200
are and what you can reduce

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,720
um you know making sure

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,480
you know one thing you can do also is

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,680
just to make sure that you're loader

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,320
loading different size images

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,440
depending on the device that the user is

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,519
using

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,560
making sure that most of your images if

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:08,079
not all are under 100 kb

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,240
and also using um source set right

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,160
setting the source using source set in

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,519
image tags for browsers that can

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,959
actually support it

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,720
so the great part about source set is

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,959
that you can define different sizes of

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
an

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,880
image and just let the browser select

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,120
the image based on

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,120
the size image source based on the size

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,680
another really easy thing to do is just

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,120
getting rid of your unused javascript

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,720
um lighthouse again to the rescue

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,320
fortunately just gives you a list of

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,000
unused js on your website so you can

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,639
just go down the hit list and fix your

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,320
site

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,480
this again is one of the things i just

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,839
love about you know web performance it

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,160
doesn't have to be

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,360
a hard thing to do you can run a

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,800
lighthouse report

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,519
run it accurately and any developer like

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,279
you know you have six months experience

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,440
one year experience whatever it is

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,680
can probably get productive pretty

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,560
easily with this stuff

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,720
um so another thing you can look at when

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,720
you're talking about unused gis

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,920
is just looking at the usage physic

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,360
visualization

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,639
so i outlined the um the steps here

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,519
but basically you just go to your

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,320
website um

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,680
go to devtools go to the console hit

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,240
more tools and then click

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
coverage you hit record you start using

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,040
the site

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,320
stop recording and then just look at the

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,399
results based on the usage visualization

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,079
and it will tell you how many unused

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,920
bytes per resource you have

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,959
so that's a really interesting and

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,959
simple thing to do

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,199
um whoops i went the wrong way

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,639
okay so i know this was a really quick

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,240
talk and i wasn't able to go into

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,040
everything but i do want to mention some

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,160
caveats

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,760
so lighthouse reports are not everything

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
i mean you should definitely be

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,000
optimizing your metrics and performance

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,800
based on your company's needs and goals

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,079
or the goals you want your users to do

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,360
without understanding what you're

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,199
optimizing for and just

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,800
micro optimizing for a good lighthouse

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,480
score because there's so many hacks you

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,120
can do right to get a good lighthouse

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,120
for

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,519
um it may end up actually hurting your

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,920
goals versus helping

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,560
so the real question is should you be

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,600
optimizing for a lighthouse score of 100

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,279
and i'm gonna say

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,800
it depends but if you really want to

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,320
thankfully again thank you google um

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,959
you can look at this really awesome site

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,800
that actually tells you uh

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,000
how like how scores are actually

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,880
calculated

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,639
based on uh your device so it's google

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,440
chrome dot github dot io slash

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,399
lighthouse

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,040
scorecalc and it'll give you um all the

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,079
different

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,839
uh scorings

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,600
so we learned a few things today i mean

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,079
measuring web performance the right way

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,839
creating that foundation how to

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,480
accurately and effectively actually

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,480
measure

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,399
uh web performance in devtools and

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,320
lighthouse we talked through a few key

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,800
lighthouse metrics and hopefully the two

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,680
easy web prefixes i shared

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,600
will help you in your journey as a

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,600
developer

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,240
so i welcome you to come hang out with

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,560
