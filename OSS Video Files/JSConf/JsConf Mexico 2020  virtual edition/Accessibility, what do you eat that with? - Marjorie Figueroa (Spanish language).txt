On the web we can find different types of content, part of our job is to create this content and we normally assume that our product, page or blog can be accessed by anyone. But in reality it is not like that, the web is full of sites that are not accessible!

Accessibility tends to be forgotten or left for last, because we do not believe it is necessary or we do not know how important it is ... But it should not be like that, we have to take it into account in every step we take and so together, little by little to make the web a place where everyone is welcome.
