the

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,160
talk is from javascript to react so

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,519
let's go

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,120
deeper and why this title

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,160
maybe you know what is happening here

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,199
so let's start with the story so you can

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,359
know why

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
once upon a time there was a developer

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,320
in 2020

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,439
in a pandemic mall like today

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,320
that he want to learn javascript and he

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,840
said

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,880
well i've been with html

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,719
css and let's start

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:45,440
with the programming

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:49,280
and let's learn about

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:53,039
how the data the string volume numbers

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,239
and then console low and

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,559
and now this text can be in the screen

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,760
and now we feel like we are a hacker

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,960
because there is a

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,000
alert window as the line number 13.

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,680
so now in the 2020 it's

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,400
let's go to react or framework or any

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,799
of these things maybe it's not your case

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
but

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,600
many times this eager

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,880
to build interfaces or

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,560
projects but as a production

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,520
we can arrived to this point

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,400
and where where everybody is talking

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,520
about

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,640
so this is an area where we

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,400
learn about language and very

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,520
important things as accessibility

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,840
but there's also a world where

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:51,280
the job you need to go to these tools

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,360
frameworks libraries so that's why

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:59,280
this is cool i just

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,159
i have this joe ds everything is working

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,159
and let's start

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
so let's continue with the information

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,160
and we

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,959
realized that this is the way to build a

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,000
component

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,640
this is the practical part so

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,520
we didn't read that this is uh that

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,959
react do it

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,760
in a declarative way not imperative way

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,560
but we are using this and everything is

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,440
fine

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,480
step number two let's do it more dynamic

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,680
less

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,680
updating this state okay this is working

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,920
however

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,480
i think that from hello world to this

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,319
point

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,400
you create a component you renderize it

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:52,800
and now it's updated and this component

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,800
is declarative not imperative

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:02,400
and now there is more knowledge

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,959
and you are obtaining more things that

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
what you are doing in an empiric way and

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,879
the other things

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,840
that you are understanding and maybe in

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,680
this way

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,159
is why this talk starts because

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,680
a lot of times when we think we are a

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,959
very experimented developers so we say

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,879
learn the language and then the

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,519
framework is very easy to say but very

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,959
hard to

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,120
to do it and to understand this empathy

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,599
in this 2020 when everything is

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,599
arranging to build things build things

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:39,840
and not to reinforce your foundations

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:44,159
be honest this is not popular if i

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,360
do a video of javascript 10 person will

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,720
watch and

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,599
with react 100 so let's

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,080
talk about once upon a time a developer

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,720
not in 2020 but 2010

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
learning javascript is the same story

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,000
but with j

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,599
curry if you want to reveal

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,959
us your how you started well i do it

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,920
in 29 2010

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,040
when i was learning javascript and the

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,439
industry

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,479
tell me jquery jquery i didn't know

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,519
where

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,600
one started and they ended the other so

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,960
there's a lot there were a lot of

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,479
questions and

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,479
few answers so

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,440
2010 june query 2020

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:37,600
react or the one and 23. what's next

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,400
something will be there

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,120
so i will give you this question the

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,479
blame is about the developers that we

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,720
are optimizing this

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,400
maybe maybe we as developers or creators

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,040
we have this commitment

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,040
or maybe it's part of the industry

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,120
maybe the the you're in your job they

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,520
say you need to know

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,240
all these languages or react or whatever

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,639
and somebody say no it's impossible it's

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,280
not

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,280
like a starting point but realities are

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,400
different

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,360
so at the end of the day those offers

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
exist and that's why we have all these

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,080
doubts

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,479
but who is to blame i don't know how

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,759
idea so for the moment i don't have the

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,440
answer

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,080
okay so we need to be okay but you can

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,120
debate

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,240
this on the chat okay

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,800
let's start this debate

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,759
explaining this language from the

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,479
perspective

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,479
of react

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,039
let's start with this how

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,320
react function or works

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,240
so we will understand of this something

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,400
that is very practical something that

00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,000
you want to learn

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,680
so learning language

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,800
of react or not react and how language

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,160
implement react because yes

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,919
we are all agree about this

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,800
so from this tutorial we can see of this

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,080
hello world

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,600
we find out two important things react

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,319
and react dumb oh my god

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,319
wait a minute

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,039
so in this tutorial we find out these

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,880
two important things

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:44,880
react and react dom and in inside react

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,240
we have this component class

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,440
and using render method

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,440
and in reactdom

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,560
there is a way of giving shape to the

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,720
browser

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,840
with this component so with this four

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,440
concept

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:07,360
we can start to advance or explain

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,560
we have these four things let's continue

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,400
so for example this will be a user

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,720
component as this user.js so the

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,120
structure of ash of these

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,080
usurp.js is more or less like this in

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,160
javascript

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:29,120
like this and maybe you can tell me

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
this is react gas original classes but

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,599
at the same time

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,960
this javascript is nothing

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,680
outside of what we know there's no

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,160
component

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,759
and the rest of the things that maybe

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,840
you will know already

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,000
but this talk is about to know all these

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,520
little things how this

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,960
how things of javascript you can learn

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,520
so once we have this component and of

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,360
course

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,560
we already know because we already see

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,840
the tutorial

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,919
and now we can have this component to

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,840
understand

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:11,599
how the properties or the body

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:15,199
of the component or something like this

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,919
where we have a component and

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,919
it's a class

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,639
and in a superficial way we have two

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,599
things to learn

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,240
classes and models and if we talk about

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,479
classes

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:34,240
is objects and a constructor

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,519
why the that method is special is there

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,959
it cannot be just another constructor

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:44,560
or we can start talk about instances

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,760
and also properties because we are using

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,360
the context of we are creating this

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,320
object and also if because we are

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,680
talking about

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,519
language we can see or we can see these

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,720
default terms

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:04,080
and this component is what react

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,959
is giving to you is exporting so we can

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,160
talk about

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,160
models exports so as you can see there's

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,680
a lot of things

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,800
that we can explain so we can

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,600
interest you in a practical way let's go

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,720
back

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,720
of the user component where i have

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,320
more form we have we have this

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,600
react as a vanilla so i'm not doing

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,880
anything i'm not using the exact code

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,320
but it will work let's just

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,760
have faith i mean so user component

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,720
will see like that and we can import it

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,720
and now we can talk about models but not

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,160
exported but imported

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,480
and how we can do it and maybe a

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,480
part of the model make x component

00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:02,240
and then the path

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,640
why you need dot gs

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,160
and then the other one is not like that

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,160
so explain a little bit more

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:17,680
in this user.js component you are

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,040
watching or seeing six lines and

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,160
17. i'm not using gs but a template

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,880
literals

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,200
is a string that it can have like this

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,560
interpolation

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,079
dynamics inside other functions and at

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,160
the end of the day many

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,600
things that we do in javascript to

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,839
manipulate information

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,720
or complex information can be more

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
simple

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:46,320
then we can use in the fi line 5

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,480
the track destruction assignment and

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,560
more specific

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,200
topic as in heritage because line number

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,560
three

00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:02,160
we are doing that we are extending user

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,920
d component and all

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,760
can be implemented in the user and also

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,720
polyform this polyform

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,560
saying is we can implement method in

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,079
different ways and in different

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,720
instances that we are creating so render

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,920
is inside the comp components because

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,200
maybe it may be

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:29,040
a user or a card

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,839
as another component so with this we can

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,760
start another topic is programmation

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:40,240
language architecture good practices

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,360
to know where the thing is start and end

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,640
and everything is javascript

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,000
perfect then

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:53,200
where is the base if

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,320
i have this component class how these

00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,399
two can be inside the browser

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,839
well in general way you will have

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,959
something like index.gs as

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:10,160
this example and i will

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,279
import another part

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,760
and as an user component and we know

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,880
that it's in the file name component

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,760
and now we have two more things first

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,639
selectors that we have in line number

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,480
four

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,480
and basically is what you learn in css

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,040
functions because at the end

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,200
renders is a function with some

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,519
parameters and then do something

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:45,120
and then instances because in 6 96

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,160
i'm using this instance remember

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,360
that this is a very easy javascript

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,760
so in theory this must be working in

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,880
your browser

00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,320
and in this new instance

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,040
is new properties and an object that has

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,079
the name

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,519
and and the avatar of the user

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,720
and a second parameter of render

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:14,240
react dom where i'm going to

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,639
render this component and this is part

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,320
of the library

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,399
library gave us an api

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,240
render must have these two parameters

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,760
and then you will do your thing

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,480
and under this sentence and

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
then my component must be updated and

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240
have

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:39,120
some structure so it can be seen in the

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:42,560
browser and with their properties

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,560
dynamic things etc

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:51,839
we can continue talking about this topic

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,839
and now react done in order to achieve

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,360
that the objective to have this

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,240
component in the screen

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,880
it can be possible so it's very simple

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,240
this is render

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,279
receive element container html

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,399
and this is equal to element.render

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,519
and we this works works

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,639
and works and then

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,360
so we can talk about functions methods

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,160
because render is a method of element

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,920
and also

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,199
dump manipulation we can have html

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:31,040
and other modalities to do this

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,040
and adapt and and

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,040
with basic thinking languages elements

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,399
some

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,600
very simple functions log

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:57,040
alert and you can see something very

00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,000
similar this is the structure with react

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,800
but now inside manila so in line number

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,240
three

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,680
we have it's a model so

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,519
everything works and

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,079
if my dot gs is not inside of a

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,120
component

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,120
so our ash will have life

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
and if you don't believe me well let's

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,680
see

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,880
maybe your next question you need us you

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,279
are cheating

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,240
because there's not a state and there is

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,240
no gsx

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,519
it cannot be updated there is not a life

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,959
cycle

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,079
but well this talk is about

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,800
to go beyond and have some fun

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,680
so let's start creating an alternative

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,720
for this to

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,959
function that basically is react is with

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,959
us

00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,800
and for gsx we have create

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,320
element so if you see your document

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,680
in this hello message there is a check

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,560
where we can take out this jsx

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,320
and this other thing is a small function

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,519
that comes from

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:20,240
react and the name is create element and

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:23,759
we this is a div and then the properties

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,880
and then receive as a third parameter

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,399
the content of that element maybe an

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,959
ola uh hello or hola in this case

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:38,000
is hola and we have the same result

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:41,279
this syntax is is a kind of

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,759
java in some way so

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:48,839
this is easier to re-implement

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,560
and at the same time to teach because

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,560
remember that

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,759
i want to teach you something that you

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,800
want to learn which is

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,600
react but before that and because we

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,360
have this

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:06,559
second function inside of this model

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,559
let's they'll do a refactor

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:14,400
i will have this file with react

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:19,839
and then we have react.js

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,839
react element.js and an index.js

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,760
i'm not lying this is the structure this

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,319
is

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:31,679
a repository react structure

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,559
you can you will find many many files

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,760
more but you

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,760
these are one of the more important

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,240
so this is an index and we can export to

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,240
functions

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,120
and this is react

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,440
we have our component and react element

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,799
is to create those elements that will

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,880
replace our

00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:04,000
gs or our template

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:06,559
let's let's go to user.js so

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,039
instead of template we will change to

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,799
create

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:14,080
element with the same structure

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:17,600
this is more complex to read

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,880
because it's not a html is

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,400
just a variables but the structure

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,520
is more understandable

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,880
at the programming level and we can

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,280
teach this

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:37,120
so again the properties

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,400
user class and then a special

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,520
property that receive the react

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,360
components

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,360
and the alignment is like that

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,679
once we know these we need to go to our

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,280
create

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,440
element like this and we are going to do

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,120
this implementation

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,960
it can be simple or sophisticated

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:09,440
create element or react element dot gs

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:13,360
and here we receive the type of element

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:17,120
h1 h2 they've whatever you want and then

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,799
the content so i need to do three things

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:24,880
first i need to create an element

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:28,000
with this type and manipulate

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,320
manipulation of dot manipulation and

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,880
then

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,880
content is very simple it's just text

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:41,840
once i have my element i put content

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,360
and where the thing that is uh tricky is

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,640
properties it can be an event

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,640
an attribute

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,799
a children so one element inside the

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,480
other

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:03,760
so here we are learning array methods

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,880
subject methods so

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,120
in line number 11 set

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,919
properties is what we are going to see

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,320
in the next

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,159
slide so you can see how this will be

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,520
implemented

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:21,280
so in set properties you will see this

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,559
isn't the same file of react element

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,840
and we will have all these things from

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,640
line two to six we have the support of

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,919
the event

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:36,480
age 11 of nested

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:40,720
children and from 13 to 15

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,360
no just 14 is the normal attribute

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,480
support

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,760
in the 15 now let me see let me see 15

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,120
13 attributes and

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:54,559
everything is okay but in

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,679
number five is set events and ten

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,360
another function render children because

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,640
again i will start

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,520
with more function and it can be more

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,280
complex

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,280
but i will put there

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,640
let's see the event part

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,840
so if you start with on it can be a

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,840
little bit more sophisticated

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:26,320
and i will say go to set event

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,840
we receive the param the parameters

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:34,000
and as simple as an element

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:37,280
event callback and this is what we do

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,720
when that event is released

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:44,080
next case does the children's support

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,280
is line number 10 render children

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,559
value and element and

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,159
simply as that we are going to call

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:58,159
this react dom inside react

00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:01,440
element and you will have a lot of

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,320
children all nested i don't know maybe

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,600
you will as a base component and then

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,400
children

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,880
a lot of children and we will have in

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,320
this

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:16,159
if in line number five so

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,159
and or line number eight

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,720
we will have just one render or a render

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,720
iteration

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,240
and we will use the same render

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,039
and we're cool and it works

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:44,720
let's continue with our state and life

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,799
cycle no there's no books

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
we are just working with classes more

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,679
didactics

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,240
to show you how this works all these

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,240
react

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,880
react like more a more explained

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,159
reaction but no there will not be hooks

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,559
let's go back to our component and then

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,240
find

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:13,919
out solution user.js

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,320
gs and now our component is demanding

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,360
more things we are seeing in this

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,480
function

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,520
that state set state

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,120
is not implemented in this user class

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,559
but in another class

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:31,760
we will see it how to do it so in theory

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,840
is when one

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:39,440
put a new state maybe an

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:43,120
object my component with reload

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,600
and then render again so what we are

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,679
doing

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:50,720
in this example in line number 18

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,840
we have this on click this will be like

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,120
an event

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,520
and when we execute this on click

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,200
we will have handle click in line number

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,400
eight

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,520
receive the event and

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,960
i'm calling in line number nine is

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,320
set state as the initial state

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,240
from line five to seven that

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,360
start with a property from the other

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,640
number ten for example

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,000
number of years that ash has

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,679
and we can implement everything of this

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,960
let's see our react dot gs

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,520
remember that our component was very

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,240
basic

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,240
very simple

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,760
now we can talk other about other

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,520
concepts

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,720
for example obstruction and

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,520
this encapsulating because they are

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,039
private elements when you have this hash

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,159
inside

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:59,360
this hashtag of

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,360
in some fields

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,320
are these private fields of javascript

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,840
so not other class can access directly

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,960
you can call set state

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,240
is implemented in this class

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,039
you can call this set state

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,320
and it will work but talking about

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,679
encapsulating

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,400
you call set state and you know what

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,760
statistic

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,480
is going to do but not how and this is

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,240
the way of encapsulating and when then

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,159
we have a private

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:39,360
state and we already

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:43,600
updated everything and we can start

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:47,360
our component with elements and state

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,360
let's go to the life cycle

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,039
user.js

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:59,039
okay if everything is

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:02,799
upgraded i want to receive

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:06,400
signals if somebody affect my component

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,799
maybe renderize it or not renderize it

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,080
or update it or whatever

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,640
to have this log so this works

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,240
because and then i need to do another

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,840
thing

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,960
as you can see in this example

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,679
and then we have a lot of components or

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,440
things in the

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,720
life cycle this is a method

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,520
that is called automatically

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,360
when this component is visible in the

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,279
browser

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:43,520
and it's simple when we this component

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,600
will start it's not in the browser but

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,080
the intention is there and that's why

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,480
is will mount when i do a set state and

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,520
my component will be updated

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,720
then i can put it there and there are

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,120
other ways of the life cycle but this is

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,440
just

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,720
an example but let's see again what is

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,159
happening

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,360
and there you have the methods

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:13,039
they're doing nothing but there are some

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,000
changes instead of render in a direct

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,840
way

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,120
now is in the line 21 that is called

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,320
build the name

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,080
is like that is i need to

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:31,360
build my component and i can call

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,480
will mount so this method will

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,760
called before so in

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,520
the render is kind of hide in this

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,000
area and when everything this is going

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,039
to

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,320
be updated in number

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:54,399
line number seven and number six

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:58,159
and then line number nine we are calling

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,440
component did update but we need more

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,200
things

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,559
where can i will implement a deed mount

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,919
and we need to do a small refactor

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:13,279
to support all these things a state

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:18,640
as life cycle but inside

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,640
react dom in this way works for me

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,559
first of all react dom is not as simple

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,159
as

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:29,120
html but in line number 11

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,640
we have an append one element will have

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,799
more elements

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,919
in line number two i see if my element

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,919
is a string

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:43,200
or is an html i just add it

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,000
why because in other way i will have

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,360
this

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,559
element in gender i have line number

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,679
five

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:55,279
and whatever i need i replace that

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,279
child or i add it

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:03,600
this function well i

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,600
think that is

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,559
it's look like ash like sees like that

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,799
and as a life cycle if i change

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,120
for example to listen or to see if it's

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:24,159
dark or light i can change from one to

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,159
the other okay this is so beautiful

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:32,080
and this how i feel when my react

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,760
works and maybe now you are

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,159
asking yourself why this stock is from

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,279
react to javascript and not the other

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:46,000
way around as many things

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,000
are questions without answers

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,559
thank you thank you very much

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,240
if you want to know more of this and let

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,120
you

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,120
can go to my youtube channel

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,679
very interesting your talk

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,120
a lot of people were waiting for these

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,960
so before this

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:16,320
talk they can use this

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:20,159
okay there's another question up to now

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:24,000
yes there's one to develop

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:26,799
react ideas in javascript it

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,360
happens the same with vue or another

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,360
frameworks

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,679
this is my opinion but it's not

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,039
necessarily a reality it's just a

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,039
perspective i think yes

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,679
when i learned react 2013 or 14 there

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,720
were a lot of

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,919
things new things in language pet

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,440
operators

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:59,039
and everything that was new and

00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,559
honest i didn't know 100 i just knew

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,799
that it was there

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,039
but i could differentiate one to the

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,760
other but with react it was very

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,799
implemented

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,799
so that was cool

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,960
and i always have that doubt react or

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,000
not react

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,200
so thanks to the way that

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,399
react implements the language very

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,640
direct

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:28,320
and it's something more fancy this helps

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:33,200
that you are curious

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:36,320
to know more about that specific

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,240
function and then you know okay it's a

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,440
operator so personally

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,440
yes it helped me

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
what do you think to learn class

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,600
component

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,200
or functions currently

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:57,200
functions with hooks

00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:00,399
but this was only to learn to teach you

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,840
about programming so from

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,919
the insides so

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,760
now that you have two contexts you can

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,760
apply in the functions

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,120
