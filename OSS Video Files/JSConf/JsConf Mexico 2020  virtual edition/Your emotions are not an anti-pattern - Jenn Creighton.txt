if you want to reach me on the internet

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,800
by the way

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,519
uh you can find me on twitter girl code

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,599
with you

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,720
is my handle so

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,279
this talk is a bit of a departure from

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,640
previous talks that i've given and

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,680
that's because there's

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,720
no code in this talk um but

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,439
you know that doesn't mean that this

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,000
code this talk isn't about code

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,560
it is it's just it's about how code

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
makes us

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,480
feel and what those feelings mean

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,040
for us as people and for our work as

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,120
programmers

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,640
it's a subject that we don't really talk

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,600
about very often

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,399
because more often than not we're really

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,719
told that

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,760
emotions don't belong in software

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,640
engineering

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,120
you know just the zeros and ones ma'am

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
no

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,520
feelings involved and i remember

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,559
as a junior engineer learning to avoid

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,760
the phrase

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,400
i feel because it meant that

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,960
no matter how technical the words were

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,000
that followed that phrase

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,640
what i said was less valuable and

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,200
that's really how subtle this bias

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,680
towards logic can be in our field

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
and sometimes it's down right explicit

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,400
you know i'm active on twitter and i

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,680
actually see this

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,560
mentioned often like this sentiment of

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,119
code is logic emotions should not be

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,119
involved

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,119
and i should be really clear here that i

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,200
am not advocating for

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,600
emotions over logic so emotions they

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,200
uh influence how we perceive perceive

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,720
the world around us

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,720
feelings are not facts and acting on

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,880
emotions alone really isn't a good idea

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,240
and we know this you know this is part

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,439
of why we d

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,119
distrust our emotions i think that's

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,880
kind of at the heart of this logic

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,680
versus emotions debate

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,320
you know you've likely experienced what

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,039
it means to have your emotions

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,080
take over or distort a situation

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,120
but that doesn't mean that logic is the

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,400
answer

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,520
so feelings aren't facts but feelings

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,040
aren't irrelevant emotions have a

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,760
purpose

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,720
you know emotions are a feature not a

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,520
bug

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,080
you know even the unpleasant emotions

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,599
the ones

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,280
we try to avoid the most

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:41,599
like anxiety or worry you know these are

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,200
subsets of fear and fear is a clarifier

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,879
you know fear can tell you that

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,680
something isn't right something is amiss

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,080
or what about anger you know anger can

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,400
actually

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,200
protect us it can tell us when a

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,239
situation

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,519
is unjust it can push us to fight for

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,879
change

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,959
and you know that doesn't mean that

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,760
anger is good a hundred percent of the

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,120
time

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,760
or fear but i want us to acknowledge

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,879
that

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,400
these emotions can be both helpful and

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,720
harmful if we don't

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,599
acknowledge that we can fall into this

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,040
trap of

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,760
either or thinking so either anger is

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,440
helpful

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:27,840
or it's harmful either we choose logic

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,560
or we choose emotion zero or one

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,480
now in either or thinking we see two

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,440
opposing options

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
and nothing else and when we're

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,360
evaluating

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,560
logic and emotions we often fall into

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,560
this pattern of thinking

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,440
you know you've probably heard that

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,680
decision making should be logical

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,599
that emotions need to be removed from

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,400
that equation

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,080
that's choosing one of the extremes

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,280
logic or emotion

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,239
you need to lock one out emotions to use

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,640
the other

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,239
logic in the words of professor trelawny

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
neither can live while the other

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,400
survives so

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,000
it's voldemort or it's harry but it's

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,200
not both

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,639
and that's fine for fiction but it

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,680
really doesn't work like that

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,519
in the real world and

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,199
you know what i'm guilty of this i'm

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,600
guilty of believing

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,400
that i could neatly separate the

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,960
rational

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,680
from the emotional but then i learned

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,400
about elliot

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,960
so like with most psychological studies

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,040
elliot

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,560
is not elliot's real name we we don't

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,840
know his real name

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,320
but we do know that elliott had a brain

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,360
tumor

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,560
in his frontal lobe and we also know

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,520
that when the tumor

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,639
was removed there was a peculiar side

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,919
effect

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,639
so elliot's emotions were impaired

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,080
now cognitively elliot understood that

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,120
he used to have

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,960
strong feelings but now he just really

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,840
felt nothing

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,880
and this isn't why elliot is a famous

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,199
case study

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080
his case is actually famous because the

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,360
surgery came

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,960
with another side effect and that was

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:21,120
impaired decision making so elliot

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,600
couldn't even make the smallest decision

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,320
his intelligence hadn't changed his

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,639
logic

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,240
was not impaired he could come up with

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,520
various options

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,320
for a given scenario but he struggled to

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,160
actually make

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,400
the decision a blue pen or a black pen

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,639
would mean hours of contemplation for

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,639
him

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,560
now antonio dimazio is a neuroscientist

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,280
who studied elliot's case

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,320
and he theorized that the impairment in

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,639
emotion

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,479
and the impairment and decision making

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,520
were connected

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,039
so this is known as the somatic marker

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,360
hypothesis

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,160
and in an effort not to bend our brains

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,319
because it is

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,520
much more involved than what i'm about

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,400
to say

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,120
i would summarize it as making a

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,840
decision

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,479
is much harder when you don't know how

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,600
you feel

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,000
about the outcome and that

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,800
how you feel about the outcome might be

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,600
a known

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,319
conscious feeling or it could be

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,319
unconscious

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,880
so feelings can act as guides in our

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,560
decision making

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,080
process emotion conscious or not

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,319
helps to filter out possibilities

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
and for me learning about this was a

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,600
huge relief

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,000
because i tend to feel really

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,240
instinctual about decisions

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,160
you know i won't be able to explain why

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,199
something feels like the right or wrong

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,240
decision

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,080
until maybe later on and this happens

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,000
a lot with code i can look at some code

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,960
and i get a feel for it

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,120
before i actually dig into it and i

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,000
really think that happens as you gain

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,479
experience in this field but for a long

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
time

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,080
i really really struggled with those

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,080
feelings

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,440
because remember i wasn't supposed to be

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,960
having feelings at

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,120
all and a hundred percent not about code

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,800
so i kept trying to separate the

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,160
feelings out

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,160
you know but after learning about

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,199
elliott and the fact that our emotions

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,759
can really help us

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,720
in decision making you know i felt more

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,639
comfortable

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,240
leaning into those instincts those

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,639
feelings

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,680
which is a really good thing because

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,880
what we do

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,800
is made better when we feel you know the

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,440
code we write isn't written

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,960
in a vacuum we're not programming in a

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,000
logic bubble

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,120
you know i want the work i put out to

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,160
feel good you know to myself and to

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
others

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,080
whether that's the co-workers i share a

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,919
code base with

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,759
or the end user and the longer i've

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,639
spent in software engineering

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,960
the more i've relied on feelings to

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,280
guide technical decisions

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,240
because i want a code base that feels

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,800
like a joy

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,639
to work at you know i want to craft

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,000
component apis that feel

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,960
open and flexible i want to hear

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,560
about how an abstraction makes you feel

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,960
are you frustrated

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,599
what if we tried it like this does that

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,720
feel

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,680
better you know i genuinely want to know

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,959
because i believe how we feel about code

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,959
changes how we work

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,959
and a really great example of this is

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,440
error messages

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,839
so we know from research that error

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,320
messages that are human readable

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,200
contextual and clear are less

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,200
frustrating

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,839
and result in shorter debugging sessions

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,200
we also know that the messages sentiment

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,240
matters

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
so in a study where programmers received

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,839
either

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,040
neutral positive or negative error

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,040
messages

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,720
those that received the negative

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,440
messages attempted

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,839
fewer repeated solutions and were

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,200
significantly less likely to finish

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,519
the task i don't even need to explain

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,240
that

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,440
further do i because we have all been

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,080
that programmer

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,560
the one muttering at our screen our

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,800
screen

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,760
maybe threatening the computer with some

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,440
creative

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,440
language happens to us all

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,440
and that's because debugging is an

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,120
emotional task

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,480
so i i love debugging but as i learned

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,920
from this twitter poll

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,640
not everyone does i i was so surprised

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,360
by this

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
i did not expect debugging to get like a

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,000
measly little

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,399
9.4 percent but when i think about

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,640
the emotional quality of these different

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,600
coding tasks

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,320
you know this makes sense and it also

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,519
makes sense

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,240
that we would want to avoid a task that

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,920
needs such

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,959
high levels of emotion regulation

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,600
so the more emotions involved the more

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,640
we need to

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,880
regulate those emotions like sometimes i

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,120
get

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,600
intensely involved in solving a bug

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,120
it is frustrating me i am getting

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,760
overwhelmed

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,800
but i don't do the thing i should do

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,839
which is take

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,920
a break but when i can feel that

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,560
frustration getting to an unhealthy

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,240
level

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,480
a level that's going to actually prevent

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,120
me from problem solving

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
i need to be able to recognize that and

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,839
take

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:45,360
the break that's regulation

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,079
or if we want a more official definition

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,720
the handbook of psychology of aging

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,839
defines

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,760
emotion regulation as any action

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,680
conscious or not that alters the

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,720
violence and intensity

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,600
of a current emotional experience or is

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,839
initiated

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,160
for the purpose of altering future

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,640
emotional experiences

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,360
so what i'm doing in the previous

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,800
example

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,880
is i'm decreasing the intensity of the

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,279
emotional experience

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,240
i'm frustrated i need to lessen that

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,600
feeling

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,640
and the first step is to get some space

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,640
between you

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,320
and what is causing the frustration so

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,959
i'm getting away from my computer

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,640
and then the second step is engaging in

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,279
an activity that's going to be the

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,560
opposite

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,600
of that emotion so for frustration i'm

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,399
likely to go for

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,440
a nice relaxing walk about town and a

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,279
stroll

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
um i'm going to talk a bit more about

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,200
that

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,920
but first i i want to be clear that

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,440
emoji

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:51,279
emotion regulation is not about stopping

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,480
the emotion emotions are not

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,560
a tap you can turn on and off

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,320
and i think that's often what we want to

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,120
do you know what we think

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,079
we should be doing but that's an

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,000
unreasonable

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,320
expectation for ourselves and for others

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,320
we actually have little direct control

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,440
over our emotions on a biological level

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,000
so in doing research for this talk i had

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,959
the

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,519
wonderful task of reading the emotional

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,880
brain

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,880
by neuroscientist joseph ledoux and his

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,399
research is focused on emotions and

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,800
consciousness

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,920
that it's a fascinating read we actually

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,920
know

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,120
so much more about the science of

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,600
emotions than i previously thought

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
we know for example that our cognitive

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,680
system

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,600
so thoughts reasons and facts

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,600
is separate from our emotional system

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,240
and we know that our brains are wired

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,440
so that the connections from our

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,399
emotional system to the cognitive system

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,160
are stronger than the inverse

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,000
connections

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,639
and this explains why emotions are able

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,440
to

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,720
flood our thoughts but our thoughts have

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,839
little influence on our emotions

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,680
so i can think stop feeling frustrated

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,440
stop feeling anxious feel happy

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,120
but those thoughts are really unlikely

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,920
to change how i feel

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,519
now that doesn't mean that i'm not able

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,800
to influence

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,519
how i feel you know i can i can watch a

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,160
film

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,279
i can go to a comedy show listen to

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,240
music

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,720
spend time with people i love we might

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,000
lack

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,040
direct control over emotions but we can

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,959
influence them indirectly we can't

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,000
change our emotional state with

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,199
internal thoughts but we can and we do

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,320
change them

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,800
with external actions so

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,639
if i go back to the debugging

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,360
frustration example

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,040
i use external actions as a method to

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,000
regulate that emotion

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,360
so step one i physically removed myself

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,800
from the stimuli that caused the

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,480
frustration

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,720
and then i mentioned the step two right

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,839
this is where i actively engage in an

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,320
action

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,959
that is the opposite of what i'm feeling

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,959
so a relaxing walk

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,800
and this by the way was not guess work

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,440
this was actually based on how our

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,720
brains

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,440
operate since we can't

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,560
think ourselves out of or into an

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,120
emotion

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,440
we can use that strong connection from

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,240
the emotional system to the cognitive

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,120
system

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,880
to help regulate the emotion we

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,639
introduce new emotions

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,160
emotions that are the opposite of what

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,880
we're feeling

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
and this works but it's it's not going

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,040
to be very quick

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,760
okay so again we're not stopping that

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,240
initial emotion we want to regulate

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,519
but over time it's going to decrease as

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,560
our emotional system

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,920
process processes the newer

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,920
opposing emotion

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,480
so what i've described here is opposite

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,399
to emotion action

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,519
or sometimes just it's called opposite

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,920
action

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,040
and it's an emotion regulation method

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,480
that's taught in

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,000
dialectical behavior therapy abbreviated

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,199
as dbt

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,639
and that type of therapy is focused on

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,040
providing skills to manage emotions

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,839
these skills and the methods involved in

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,079
teaching them

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,600
like right emotion regulation and

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,000
opposite action

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,079
these are based on evidence you know

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,880
what we know about how the brain

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,680
processes emotions and there's another

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,079
skill

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,079
mindfulness that is taught in dbt

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,759
mindfulness is a bit of a buzzword these

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,360
days

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,360
you know thanks to the rise of

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,639
meditation apps like headspace

00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,399
and calm but mindfulness doesn't come

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:03,199
from meditation alone mindfulness is

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,399
a state of active open attention to the

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,279
present

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,399
so meditation is one of the examples of

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,480
practicing that active open attention

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,519
but there are some other maybe more

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,880
subtle options

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,440
like yoga and what we're attempting to

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,600
do

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,880
with mindfulness is to bring some

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,800
consciousness

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,800
to an unconscious state

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,279
emotions are an unconscious state when

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,639
we're aware of what we're feeling

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,000
that's actually us bringing

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,279
consciousness to that unconscious state

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,759
it's like breathing how often are you

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,560
conscious of your breath but you're

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,959
doing it

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,680
whether you think of it or not and it's

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,360
the same

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,240
with our emotions all emotions start as

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,839
unconscious automatic responses to

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,959
stimuli

00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:01,120
sometimes we're aware of those responses

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:05,039
sometimes you can think of emotions

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,480
as icebergs ninety 90 is under the water

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,039
unseen now mindfulness can help us

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,280
become

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,799
more conscious of these unconscious

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,280
emotions

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,559
some of them you know that's really the

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,760
best that we can do

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,480
and it takes practice so

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,439
what mindfulness asks us to do is to

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,160
pause

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,000
and to examine what is happening in the

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,320
moment

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
i found that pausing can help me

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,240
identify

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,039
how i feel in a situation you know where

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
i might be too

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,280
distracted to notice identifying

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,039
emotions

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,640
can be difficult so i want to share

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,760
with you how i do this and it's mostly

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,880
through recognizing the physical side of

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,480
emotions all emotions cause

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,840
physiological changes and i i find this

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,360
really fascinating

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,120
these physical changes are actually

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,600
universal

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,120
we all have an idea of what it means to

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,880
physically experience

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:12,080
certain emotions so sadness

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,039
is often described as a weight

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,840
it tends to reside in our chest and in

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,840
our shoulders

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,679
happiness is akin to like a tingling

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,640
sensation

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,760
kind of like a like a fizzy soda and it

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,039
tends to like spread

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,559
throughout the body

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,000
and this is why if you take nothing else

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,320
away from this talk

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,440
i want you to know that there is value

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,039
in feeling

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,480
your feelings what we feel can be

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:47,200
unpleasant those physical changes

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,880
can be really uncomfortable and since we

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,320
can't turn off our emotions with the

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,919
flick of a switch

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,360
we're often left to deal with the

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,240
physical sensations

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,799
for longer than we'd like you know for

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,960
me

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,520
this has resulted in suppressing

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,000
emotions i didn't want to feel

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,919
suppressing is like dimming down the

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,480
light on consciousness

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,720
you know you distract yourself from that

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,600
emotional sensation

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,080
but it's still there and what i found

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,280
was

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,160
that the more i did this the harder it

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,200
became

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,120
to identify emotions later on

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,039
which meant i had a harder time

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,640
recognizing that i needed to regulate

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:31,039
an emotion and it just wasn't healthy

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,000
so deciding to actively engage with my

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,160
feelings

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
sit with them feel their physical

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,679
presence

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,679
you know not to be dramatic but it

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,919
really was life-changing for me

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,320
it gave me more information about myself

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,720
how i felt about situations i was in

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,720
and how to regulate those feelings

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,320
the truth is that we don't take physical

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,760
symptoms

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,640
of emotions very seriously emotions can

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,600
cause

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,640
physical pain studies have even shown

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,120
that you can take

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:08,080
aspirin to help with emotional pain

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,360
but we don't treat emotional wounds like

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,640
wounds

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,240
wounds get first aid emotional pain

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,760
we tell people to shrug it off ignore it

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,400
don't take it personally but what would

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,480
happen

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,799
if we treated those wounds with

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,520
emotional first aid

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,880
so before i leave you today i want to

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
take you through an example of what it

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,080
means to

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,200
apply some emotional first aid and

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,640
you're going to recognize a lot of

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,840
concepts that we've already talked about

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,840
in this talk as we go through this

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,120
now the example that i've chosen is a

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,120
rejected code review

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,600
oh god i chose this on purpose because

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,720
you know whether we want to admit it or

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,480
not

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,480
code reviews can be the source of

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,400
emotional turmoil

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,559
you know we created a thing and now

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,360
we're being told it's not good enough

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,000
or we made a silly mistake or i don't

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,880
know name

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,200
a million other little things that can

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,240
make us feel not so great

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,720
even if our reviewers are kind criticism

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,679
can

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,440
hurt and that's because criticism can

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,760
feel like rejection

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,000
and rejection is one of the most painful

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,280
emotions

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,760
brain scans show that activated regions

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,080
when we

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,799
experience rejection are the same

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,240
regions

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,880
that activate when we feel physical pain

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,440
and in studies of rejection participants

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,520
rated their pain as

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,200
significant even if the scenario

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,960
did not seem proportionate to the

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,000
feeling like

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,640
true story being left out of a game of

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,760
catch

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,559
with two strangers

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,960
rejection is this painful because we

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,080
need

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,440
community we need it to survive we need

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,559
it to thrive

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,360
rejection puts that at risk we are

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,039
primed to protect ourselves against it

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,919
to go into warning mode

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,039
when it happens so when our code is

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,320
criticized

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:11,440
it can hurt even when we know

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,080
it shouldn't that doesn't mean that it's

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,320
not a wound worth treating

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,039
okay so what's our treatment plan

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,600
well our first step is that we don't

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,320
take any action at all

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,960
remember that mindfulness asks us to

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,120
pause

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,520
so that we can examine what is happening

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,880
in the moment

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,159
so don't take any action don't respond

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,120
take a moment for yourself just pause

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,799
now learning that i could pause not

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,360
respond not take any action

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,159
and take some time for myself that has

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,520
been a

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,919
transformative lesson for me pausing is

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,880
really

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,600
an act of self-care it is taking the

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,360
time

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,760
that you need now

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,280
during this pause we need to ask

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,280
ourselves some questions

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,600
first we need to identify what we're

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,960
feeling what is the feeling

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,200
well we know that we're hurt

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,480
but maybe we don't know the exact thing

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,760
that we're feeling

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,080
um so this is a good time to

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,799
feel how you physically feel see if that

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,520
registers with you about any emotions

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,480
uh see if that comes to mind rejection

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,679
often feels

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,120
like a very sharp pain in the chest

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,440
uh sometimes it can feel like your

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,559
stomach has dropped out of your body

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,039
oh it's very very uncomfortable um

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,919
identifying what you're feeling giving

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,720
it a name

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,080
it's just a really big help um sometimes

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,600
i also

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,720
turn the attention to the thoughts that

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,159
i'm having i might write them down

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,760
even when they're really unpleasant

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,600
thoughts and

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,200
in the example of a code review that got

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,559
rejected that i might be feeling hurt

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,360
about

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,440
you know i might notice that i'm worried

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,559
if i belong on my team

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,799
i'm worried i'm not doing well enough um

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,559
and i can sort of see that start to be

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,520
like i'm gonna get rejected from my

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,760
community

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,360
and that's that's me feeling rejected

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,960
now the other thing that we really have

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,120
to decide is

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,400
if what we're feeling is proportional to

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,080
the situation

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,760
so i mentioned earlier that you know

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,799
feelings aren't facts but they're not

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,520
irrelevant

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,880
they can give you a lot of information

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,960
just because you're feeling something

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,279
doesn't mean that it it's proportional

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,720
to the situation you know a code review

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,799
you know if we think about that

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,600
logically it shouldn't cause

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,279
that much pain so we know that we need

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,120
to regulate it you know if we see that

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,120
our emotions are not proportional to the

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,400
situation we know that we need to do

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,720
something with them

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,880
help decrease them and make ourselves

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,640
feel better

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,320
and similar to before i'm going to

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,919
choose the opposite to emotion action

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,400
which means that first i need to

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,679
identify what the opposite emotion

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,960
is now rejection lowers our sense of

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,600
self-worth

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
and it puts our feeling of belonging at

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,919
risk

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,480
so i need something that is the opposite

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,000
of that i need to increase my self-worth

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,600
and i need to feel feelings of social

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,360
connection and then the last step is

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,559
that you know i need to make a plan for

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,279
how to replenish those feelings um that

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,880
might be

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,320
spending time with friends if you're

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,120
able to uh call a loved one to chat

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,240
um even interacting with others via

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,559
online gaming

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,760
can be a social experience that can

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,440
replenish us

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,279
so that's a hundred percent valid as

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,200
well whatever you can do

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,200
to replenish those feelings

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,279
so to recap we paused

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,480
we took some time to identify what we

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,000
were feeling

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,840
we leveled it we decided how

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,960
proportionate it was and that helps us

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,760
know how

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,799
much we need to regulate it um and then

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,960
we actually made a plan

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,440
to regulate it and these are just some

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,520
basic steps you can always take

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,880
now all of these are actually really

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,520
super hard to do

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,320
i know i made them sound very simple um

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,880
but they take

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,640
a lot of practice and so everything i've

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,640
talked about today

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,000
you can go further with all of this and

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,799
so the last thing i want to leave you

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
with is just

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,840
some resources for you some books that i

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,159
read in preparation for this talk some

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,799
books that i've read on my journey

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:38,400
and i hope that they help you thank you

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:40,480
all so much

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,480
