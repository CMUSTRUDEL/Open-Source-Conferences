Title: Ode to the decade++ - Eva Ferreira  [English translated audio]
Publication date: 2021-02-09

Description: 
	There were once browsers without element inspector, CSS without border-radius, JavaScript without arrow functions. Although a world without Flexbox and Template Literals sounds scary ... I invite you to reflect on what is really the darkest time for Front-end developers. Let's ask ourselves if the times were dark when we were worried about border-radius or if we should really be worried about the current times, where a simple landing needs 800kb of JavaScript to display.

thank you very much to the team of

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,440
jsconf to organize this

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,200
in a very complex year

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,200
such as this and so i appreciate the

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,560
effort my name is eva

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,760
as people said i really like to make

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,480
this kind of famine

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,240
animations that are a bit useless but i

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,480
love them

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,480
my full name is maria van gelina freida

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,160
kuzminski but that is very long

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,599
and very complicated to pronounce so

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,559
please call me eva

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,520
i've been making websites since 2008

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,680
since i was

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,320
in middle school so i was curious to

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,760
read about

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,360
http and css so i created this wonderful

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,879
website

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,920
where i was just asking my

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,280
schoolmates the booklets of the cities

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,120
so i scanned them and i upload them so

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,480
if you couldn't buy the cds you could

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,640
found them here

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:06,080
about how the images inside

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,880
were and you could i had a lot of

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,320
music i had even britney spears or green

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,880
day of innocence

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,439
every text was blue the links were blue

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,000
because i didn't know how to change them

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,080
so i'm very fond of this website even

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,159
though it is very ugly

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,920
and the years went by so i discovered

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,280
that i really loved

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,759
making websites and that i loved it

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,439
among the sites that i created i had

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,200
created

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,320
websites about bands that i liked um

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,759
for example about kitty this is a metal

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,200
band from canada

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,600
you can look it up

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,720
and i like how creating websites

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,920
i created websites to

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,840
complete news about musicians and i

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,360
started receiving messages

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,840
about people from all over the world

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,680
that also like my band and it was also

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,240
amazing

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,680
and then when i finished high school and

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,239
i had to

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,400
decide what to be when i was older

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,800
because the time was that

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
i really knew that i wanted to make

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,440
websites

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,560
i knew that i liked it so i had i could

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,160
apply

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,599
to a scholarship to access

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,480
a short career and in that scholarship

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,680
they asked me

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,440
specifically why i wanted to study this

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,800
this is something that surprised me a

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,879
lot because i was used to

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,959
well when someone got a scholarship they

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,160
had to justify

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:47,040
their academic merits and not so much

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,640
their enthusiasm about studying so this

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,000
was one of the thing

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,160
that i really liked about that

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,760
scholarship application i really had to

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,480
prove that this was

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,680
something that i was passionate about so

00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,840
that was above

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,080
the academic merit that we had in high

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,440
school

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,720
so i really found my scholarship

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,920
application

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,000
and it said something like a letter

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,120
to santa or something like that i want

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,319
to connect people

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,280
and the web allows me to do that

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,720
and that was adorable that was me at 18.

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,959
but the years went by

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,959
and today i still work doing websites

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,879
and i'm very proud of what i built

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,319
and i'm very positive looking at the

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,319
future

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,760
and among many things i started giving

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,959
talks

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,879
giving classes in universities i've

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,080
always worked as a freelancer and then i

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,519
started working

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,159
for different companies and during all

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,200
this time

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,400
i kept the love and passion that i have

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,879
for the web

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,720
so i wanted to i want to show you the

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,080
top ten

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,519
of the best things that i saw

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,560
growing up in the web

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,439
this is a very personal opinion you're

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,239
going to

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,720
notice that i really love front end the

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,680
ui

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,480
space where you can design even if

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,519
without being a designer

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,120
so i am very on the side of front end

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,800
because that is what i like

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,080
so the number 10 is less unnecessary

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,360
images

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,479
when we when in 2008 we want to do a

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,680
gradient

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,199
we had to open photoshop make a one

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,560
pixel

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,440
wide image and that we can put as a

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,000
background

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,120
a repeating background maybe some of you

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,440
lived that

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,800
and that was very upsetting because when

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,080
you want to modify

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,639
that gradient you had to open photoshop

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,960
again

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,560
making the image again exporting it

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,360
again modifying the code

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,080
uploading everything again through ftp

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
and it took

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,759
a lot of time so nowadays we have

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,360
gradients

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,680
with gradient lines or radius gradient

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,080
that solves our problem having an image

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,639
that is not really necessary

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,080
another thing that about unnecessary

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,280
images that we suffered

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,080
about those who made websites is

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,440
the round borders there was no border

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,720
radius so

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,240
what we had to do is using four

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,759
pseudo elements each on a corner

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,639
to locate a an image that we had in

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:36,880
photoshop that we positioned precisely

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,880
and we had to do that in every corner

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,000
and of course if we had the need

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,440
to change for example the color

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,320
you had to redo all the process

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,560
so when finally border radius was here

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,199
because i was really excited because wow

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,039
i was finally able to make circles

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,360
and round borders and i don't have to

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,479
open photoshop to do that

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,759
and in reality i realized that i

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,919
couldn't really

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
do circles with border radius because

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,080
the text

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,440
didn't adapt to it but i wasn't mad

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,319
because we have a lot of

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,199
clip path shapes and svg that allows us

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
to

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,440
do this very simple do

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,319
things that are not rectangles shapes

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,160
where the text adapts to a shape such as

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,039
a circle

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,199
so it's very amazing not to have

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,639
unnecessary images because you have less

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,600
requests to the service

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,919
to the server because it's less costly

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,280
we don't have to pay that

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,680
and it's better for our code because

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,600
it's

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,199
it's a lot cleaner and it can grow

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,759
better

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,400
and it is amazing that we are no longer

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,840
forced

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,599
to work the web with rectangles within

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,120
rectangles

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,840
okay number nine is all es6

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,960
i think es6 is the biggest change we

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
have lived

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,919
in the latest years one of the my

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,599
favorite things we are going to call it

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:12,639
arrow functions and

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,440
they came here to improve

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,639
the way we made anonymous function

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,080
instead of

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,720
just writing function and through

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
parentheses we just wrote the parameter

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
name

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,520
an arrow and then our code is more

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,479
ordered

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,120
and we can do very interesting stuff

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,440
such as

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,639
not putting parentheses in if we have

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,479
just a parameter

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,759
or just an instruction within keys

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,280
so it is very interesting this is

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,160
something that i really loved about

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,680
es6 that has a lot of features brought a

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,319
lot of features to

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,520
javascript number eight was the leia

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,000
revolution

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,919
the the floats i hope you never had to

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,479
learn floats

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,080
and if you did please know that we don't

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,240
you do not have to use them

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,360
so you can enjoy your life without

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,280
floats

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,080
floats were suffering for a lot of us

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,120
because we had to patch them a lot of

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,479
the time

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,919
and it is

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,960
it is we learned a lot how to do this

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,800
this hacks because it is a style that

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,800
we could change a lot and finally

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,039
grids and flexbox were here were two

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,720
technologies that allowed us to change

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,919
our layouts in a very stable way

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,560
and the question is always using should

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,440
we use

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,320
grids or should we use flexbox and the

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,959
answer is

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,000
you should use them both because you

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,959
can't combine them

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
in your css and you can use them

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,440
together

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,240
so that one and the other could become

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,880
an

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,959
a wonderful element about your website

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
so if you have a question about how to

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,680
use them

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,080
please ask me about that and also the

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,040
box alignment module was created

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,440
this is some sort of working draft of

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,519
the w3c

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,519
where alignment is separated

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,880
and elements are separated in a

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,600
different module

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,440
it's not grid it's not module it is a

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,040
different module

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,640
within css so every time we use

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,600
alignment items

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,600
we are using the box alignment module

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,480
and what's happening here is that

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
the implement implementation in in

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,399
browsers

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,440
it's even faster because the modules are

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,480
getting smaller

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,760
and they can be implemented faster and

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,040
what i love to mention

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:49,200
is that css is awesome and

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:53,200
we owe a lot today to two amazing women

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:57,120
that allowed us to have browsers

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,519
and acceptance in a lot of the browsers

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,279
in flexbox and greece these women are

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,440
jen simmons and rachel andrew

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,440
these are the people who work in web

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,720
development

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,519
20 years ago and they

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,600
they achieved having the browsers

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,800
implementing these modules and teach

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
developers how can we use them to create

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,240
all these layouts

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,680
i always like to mention to mention

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,000
these two women because they

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,079
changed the history of css in the la in

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,680
the past years

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:34,160
and number seven is fetch fetch is

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,720
xml http request renewed

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,279
i just don't have to type that ever

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,279
again

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,760
or say it out loud because that was

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,000
something very complex i was always

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,519
wrong writing it wrong saying it and of

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
course i don't we don't have to do it

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,959
again because now we have fetch

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,320
i'm not going to deny that thanks to xhr

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,600
i learned a lot of

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,000
http calls and i realized that there was

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,640
a 418 a call which was

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,200
basically i'm a teapot i invite you to

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,920
read about that in wikipedia

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,200
that's very interesting and when fetch

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,200
started to happen

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,720
that was something very interesting

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,519
because it didn't work

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,079
anywhere it was a wonderful idea to

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,920
implement

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,320
in browsers but it was just not

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,920
implemented in any browser

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,560
so then appeared the regina george meme

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,760
about stopped trying to make fetch

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,040
happen

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,560
and many years later there was always

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,040
regina george saying we still can't use

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,360
fetch

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:40,000
but nowadays we can we have 1995 percent

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,880
of browsers with support for fetch

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,120
so now we can enjoy it without any

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,640
problems

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,800
number six is picture element this is a

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,519
tag that is not very new but i think it

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,720
modified a lot the way in which we

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,120
wrote responsive images it is a tag that

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,720
allows us to work responsive images from

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,399
html

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,200
and avoids using unnecessary data for on

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:11,360
behalf of the user

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,279
and we can just tell the browser to load

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,959
one image or the other

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:20,000
all from html so we can deliver this

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,720
different image formats so the design

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,079
team

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,399
can use a better image for example for

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:32,000
desktop or for mobile devices

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,519
this is something amazing and it works

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,600
within this picture tag

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,519
with different image sources we can

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,480
indicate in media in what

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,920
screen size we wanted to load and

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,079
everything has a very native fallback

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,200
then the browsers that do not understand

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,320
picture

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,000
what they do is load the default image

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,279
and that is the small logo

00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,600
and this tag also allows us to use this

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:05,760
as a fallback from different

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,959
image formats for example webp or jf

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,720
jpg if the browser does not allow the

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,959
webp

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,240
format it will recognize the other this

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,440
web p

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,959
format allows us to save data this is

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,800
a new one as well as abi this is a new

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:28,240
format that was released on september

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,040
and this person wrote an article about

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
how can we

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,000
implement this this image format that

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,720
how can we start using it

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,880
so this picture element works in 95

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,600
percent of browsers today

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,160
so it is amazing if you are not using it

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,519
i invite you to start using

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,560
webp image format is also very well

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,519
implemented

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,320
and a beef is something very new it was

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,639
released on september so it has 25

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,360
acceptance but if you use it in a

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,639
picture

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,160
tag you can generate a native fallback

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,480
so the browsers that have a beef that

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,959
support a beef can load it and those who

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,760
can't are going to fall back

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,680
number five is componentization and i do

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,880
not refer to frameworks

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,120
i really prefer the the concept of

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,480
components that is the amazing thing

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,199
that happened in the past

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,160
years the frameworks were a consequence

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,120
of that

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,040
the components allows us to have a much

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,839
more stable architecture

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,320
much more scalable architecture and

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,519
create

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,240
elements that are really reusable so we

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,800
can

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,240
have a lot of elements that we can reuse

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,399
all the time

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,959
and i think that something that i like

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,880
the most about components

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,720
is that they allow us to work with the

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,959
design team maybe as developers we

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,839
didn't have such a big connection

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,680
but now through componentization we are

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,320
working together and generate

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,440
better products at the end of the day

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,360
number four is

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,600
animations i know that competence

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,240
sound more important but i really like

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,560
animations

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,600
that is something that i really love

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,800
even though i don't earn money from that

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,160
animations in 2008 were basically made

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,440
in flash

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,279
but flash died and when it died there

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,160
was an empty hole in many of

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,680
our hearts because it was something that

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,800
was very easy to do

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,920
for animations it has a very low entry

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,440
barrier

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,440
it was just having the software and

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,079
that's that but now

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,160
we had a space that we didn't have a

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,079
nice way to add animations

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,600
to the level of quality that flash

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,399
allowed us

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,720
but now we can make animations a very

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:54,000
interesting high quality animations

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:56,880
with css with javascript or with svg

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
and all of these together if you want to

00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,680
search in

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,440
code b there is a very interesting

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,639
account i recommend

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,440
chris gannon he makes animations such as

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,720
this

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,399
spinning pizza it's not very useful also

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,440
miyazani she makes css and html

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,519
animations

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,480
there is no javascript no

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,959
svg in these animations and also rachel

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,079
nabors this is a person who used to do

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,880
comics and now

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,880
is doing web development so she has a

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,160
lot of

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,519
videos in youtube and talks about how to

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,560
make animations

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,000
so i invite you to look for more about

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,920
her

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,839
number three is html5 forms

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,040
i don't know if you ever suffered

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,079
validating directions email addresses

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,040
in regex regular expressions

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,399
regex is one of the most wonderful and

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,600
most horrible things

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,199
in programming languages all the time

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,040
we're trying to read

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,040
stuff about regular expressions and

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,199
trying to remember how they go

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,760
and every time we on the next day we

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,120
forget how they work

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,240
until some fake books start to

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,600
appear with jokes in the middle such as

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,079
rejects by trial and error combining

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,600
bars and dots until something happens or

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,120
just changing stuff and

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,439
and seeing what happens that is the

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,280
definition of our work

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,840
because the truth is that regular

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,480
expressions

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,960
we suffered a lot as developers when we

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,640
had something as basic as validating an

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,600
email form

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,080
now we have native validations such as

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,160
email validation where we do not have to

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,679
write this regular expression

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,400
because the browser does it now

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,520
the required field when you used to need

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,160
a script

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,440
that said if that field was required and

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,559
validated and now we just have to

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,679
we just have to write it in the html

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:07,440
and also the type number the input so

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,120
we can modify the keyboard in the mobile

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,160
device and also something

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:16,799
amazing that some that was

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,600
very costly to amount was the type date

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,960
this is a very native date picker in the

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,520
browser

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,000
because when i had to create a dave

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,440
picker

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,039
in the browser i ended up using

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,880
jquery and writing css in javascript and

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,120
begging for it to work

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,640
and now we don't have to do that we have

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,240
a basic type

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,520
basic date picker number two

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,799
is node and i couldn't

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,400
really explain in jsconf mexico what

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,240
node is

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,559
we all know what it is and we all know

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,720
how important it is

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,240
i am going to recommend you to look at

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,600
the talk where ryandahl presents

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,919
this node maybe it happened in 2009

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,559
and to learn to see what was the idea

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,039
behind creating node and how it advanced

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,039
throughout the years

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,240
you can see that if you're interested

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,679
and number one

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,320
was developer tools there is nothing

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,000
that i love

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:25,200
the most in web development especially

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,760
in apps in front end they are amazing

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,440
because developers tools started with

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,480
the concept of firebox

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,400
it was a development tool that was able

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,799
to be used in firefox

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,120
and now we have them in all browser even

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,440
in internet explorer

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,120
and have developer tools that are very

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,840
good and they help us

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,320
making a lot of websites we can work

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,160
html css javascript directly on the

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,280
browsers we can design

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,640
in the browser we can verify

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,520
accessibility

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,320
we can verify if a progressive web app

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,160
works well

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,919
or has a failure directly in the

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,640
browsers without

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,880
just moving to another device it's

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,280
better performance better memory

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,600
how it works the memory in the browsers

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,960
i recommend that you check this talking

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,440
from katie fan where she explains how to

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,960
use

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,159
dev tools to learn to use memory

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,880
and also tools that are exclusive from

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,720
frameworks such as angular they can be

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,050
used directly in the browsers

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,240
this is amazing how

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,840
[Music]

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,960
developer tools encompass all of that

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
and i love this cat

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,600
okay so we are in an amazing

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,760
time to learn web development don't you

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,039
think

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,600
well maybe not why

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,520
because nowadays when we log into a

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,039
website we do not see those amazing

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,559
things that i talked about not

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,960
necessarily i mean

00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,600
i see the round border i see the drop

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,559
shadow

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,679
but the user experience is not very good

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,400
so what happened

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,240
in the medium when we log into our

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,480
website today we have

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,640
a banner to accept cookies a banner to

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,440
disable your ad blocker

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,880
a banner to sign up your agents letter

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,360
and

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,120
a question about a long notification and

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,960
when we close all those pop-ups we do

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,760
not remember what we wanted from that

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,960
site

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,520
so the experience of navigating websites

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,080
today

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,200
is not equal to the experience of all

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,360
the things

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,240
that improved something happened in the

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,120
medium

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,440
we were doing well but things happened

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,360
this

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,600
is a very funny sentence

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,640
whose context is not very funny because

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,360
it's from the

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,280
former president of argentina but it

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,799
describes the situation

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,559
where we had a lot of good things

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,919
happening on the web but something

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,720
failed

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,320
so was let's let's see what failed let's

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,840
see what didn't went well

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,960
for start push notifications

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,320
one day some person just woke up in the

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,480
morning and decided

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,480
well it would be a good idea to have

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,120
notifications directly in the browser

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,840
when there's

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,240
something new so that was a good idea

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,400
and

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,600
this kind of banners started to be

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,360
creating

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,720
there is a there is a banner here that's

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,559
saying

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,320
would you like to receive notification

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,799
from this website and every website

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,000
started

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:34,559
using them even medicine websites

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,919
that modify the buttons and it says here

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,159
this site would like to send you

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,039
notifications and the buttons is

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,559
allow or no i don't want to live so what

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,039
happened

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,720
the years went by and basically we

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,600
started to realize that

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,159
push notifications were not a good idea

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,600
and

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,919
browsers such as firefox started to

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,120
create features within the browser such

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,240
as this

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,880
push notifications blocker so if you

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,280
used

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,799
firefox you didn't suffer from push

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,880
notifications

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,480
because most of push notifications were

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,120
something that people weren't interested

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,600
in

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,840
and something that is very sad because

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,760
first we created the technology and then

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,039
we created the technology to block this

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,480
technology so

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,600
well we got it wrong then is the cookie

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,760
banner this is this

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,520
lovely things that this is the first

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,559
thing and probably the only thing

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,400
that we see when we browse

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,880
and this is something that always

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,559
existed but now it's more prominent

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,559
due to the gdpr which was implemented in

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,360
europe a couple of years ago

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,120
and what this loadout is does is talking

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,080
about privacy in the web

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,240
and a lot of times you just think about

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,320
well i don't have nothing to hide but

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,279
it is not about that it's not about

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,960
having

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,600
things to hide it's just there are

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,720
things about your life that are private

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,440
for example uh

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,480
some people did a study and about for

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,760
example

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,960
after period tracking apps and

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,360
they realized that these apps shared

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,640
information about periods with third

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,200
parties

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,159
so we found ourselves in our situations

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,480
so

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,559
my mom does not know the date of my

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,279
periods but facebook and google does and

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,240
why is that

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,039
because we're sharing such private

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,960
information

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:31,840
and so important information personally

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,919
with companies that really do not have

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,720
to know this information we do not

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,600
decide

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,000
what kind of information do they have so

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,720
why

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,080
are we doing this atrocious privacy

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,440
violation

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,679
and the general answer is well

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,960
if the product is for free so you are

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,080
the product

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,080
but this this justification is just a

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,919
very vague justification

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,159
to not accept that we can do it better

00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,200
and that perhaps we're doing it wrong

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,320
if we encrypt passwords if we can

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:08,240
encrypt telegram messages and

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,679
telegram or signal whatsapp messages

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,440
so why can't we encrypt our data

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:18,000
benedict is creating a period tracker

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,520
is a mobile application that is

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,320
completely encrypted

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,600
and this is how things should be why

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,400
should a company

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,600
know the dates of my period why that is

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,039
my problem

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:34,000
so those things can be done it's just

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,640
that people decide not to do them well

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,600
and then accessibility web aim is a

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,840
company

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,039
about accessibility in the us and it

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,600
research a lot of

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:48,000
a million websites about the wchd

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,640
which is the web content accessibility

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,960
guidelines

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,799
and 98 of websites failed

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,279
the most common mistakes were low

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,240
contrast lack of alternative text empty

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,600
links

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,799
um no forms no correct forms and this is

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,120
not something

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,240
that people should not come to teach us

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,960
nobody should come

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,440
and teach us how to create alternative

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,360
text we should know how to do this

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,600
and as a matter of fact we do know this

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,240
so why don't we do it

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,240
something else is starbucks confirmed

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,880
that it's network it's wi-fi networks

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,919
use

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,279
the client's computer to mine bitcoins

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,000
this is something that

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,320
happened in argentina and they said that

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,840
it was a mistake

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,400
and well i would love that the box would

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,159
give me

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,559
money but no they're just bugs

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,679
and then microsoft confirms that edge is

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,919
moving to chromium

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,799
this is something that we already lived

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,080
this is the

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:51,760
monopoly that we had in the 90s

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,159
and the end of the decade of 2000

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,799
because ninety percent of users used

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,400
only

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,960
one browsers and nowadays will have

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,159
websites that don't work because they

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,679
work only for internet explorer

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,400
so this process of killing a renderized

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,039
process

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,159
is not something that makes us happy now

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,480
something

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,400
that should worry us is the amount of

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,679
browsers that use chromium and

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,960
now we are starting to have

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:26,320
no diversity in browsers again and

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,399
then we have this news about taylor

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,679
swift blacking out her website

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:35,840
she said i want to make my

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:39,200
website black and now i want to

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,960
have my website be just black

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,000
it was an totally black website but

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,320
it had to load 800 kilobits

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,399
and they had to load react to do that

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,880
why what's going on it was just an empty

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,880
website

00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:00,320
so what happened to us

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,440
if we had so much technological

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,360
development so

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,480
so many good things happening in web

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,039
development

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,640
why are we forgetting the user are we

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,000
maybe losing empathy

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,960
are we tired this is something very

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,919
complex

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,760
because maybe if we look at a job search

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,000
in development

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,200
they ask for a lot of things but the

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,799
truth is

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,840
that lack of accessibility is not evil

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,240
if you don't put an alt attribute in an

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,960
image

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,399
is not evil it's not you know about

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,200
cursing blind people

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,559
it's just lack of knowledge lack of time

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,039
because this is the amount

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,360
of things that we have to learn some

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,520
things are more simple of course

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,679
we don't have to worry about around

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,080
border but at the same time we're trying

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,919
to do

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,799
everything at the same time and we're

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,919
just one person so we do everything

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:56,320
mediocre and we end up doing less

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,640
we end up worsening the situation we end

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,559
up with impostor syndrome

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,960
where we believe that everyone knows

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,440
anything everything except me

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,279
and i don't have time and i saw a video

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,799
and i don't understand anything but i

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,919
don't want to acknowledge it because i'm

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,840
embarrassed

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,600
and there's so much to learn and so

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,799
little time and there's also

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,120
a life out there outside of work

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,279
so i want to tell everyone that the

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,840
false full stack developers is something

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,840
good

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,000
if you ever felt like a false full text

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,039
development

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,799
well i really love front-end development

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:36,000
and do not let that over overwhelm you

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,600
it is great for you to specialize

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,039
and learn a bit about things you don't

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,480
have to be an expert in

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,799
everything because the web is beautiful

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,919
and i think we can do amazing things if

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,080
we have

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,760
as i have shown and this year 2020

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,279
have showed us the importance of the

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,799
websites and

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,720
how important it is to connect each

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,600
other and we need to take care of it

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,159
a little more and take care of the users

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,399
because

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,080
when we inspect elements and we try to

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,679
solve problems

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,960
but the user needs the website to work

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,840
with uh probably a screen reader because

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,600
the person has no other way to use the

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,760
website

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,159
and we need to take care among each

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,080
other because if we do not take care

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,200
of each other how are we going to do

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,120
things well

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,240
we need to be well we need to take

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,440
vacations we

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,600
need to check on our college colleagues

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,360
if one of our colleagues is tired we

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,080
need to ask what they need because we

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,320
need to

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,679
take care of each other to keep creating

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,039
wonderful things

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,360
that is about the web and to create more

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,320
more pizza cats in the universe so thank

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,320
you very much
