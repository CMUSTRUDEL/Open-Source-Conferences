Description: 
	React is hard. There are a lot of resources for getting started, but things can get complex and confusing when writing full blown application. Navigating its ecosystem is a lot to take in and sometimes extremely overwhelming. With this talk, I hope to help you understanding some of its gotchas more clearly, while giving you some confidence when building bigger React applications.
