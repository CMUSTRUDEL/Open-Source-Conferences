Description: 
	On the web we can find different types of content, part of our job is to create this content and we normally assume that our product, page or blog can be accessed by anyone. But in reality it is not like that, the web is full of sites that are not accessible!

Accessibility tends to be forgotten or left for last, because we do not believe it is necessary or we do not know how important it is ... But it should not be like that, we have to take it into account in every step we take and so together, little by little to make the web a place where everyone is welcome.

	00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,800
i'm going to talk about access

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,679
accessibility what how can we eat this

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,320
but before

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,840
talking about this i would like to about

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,480
to talk about disability

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,119
and the word disability this word is

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,800
what we know like as umbrella

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:26,160
term is a word or a sentence that

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,519
uh get together a lot of concept

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,559
for example uh they are the bird

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,360
world includes every type of bird using

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,480
these terms

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,520
i is becoming with some problematic

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,879
base as how our brain works so

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,079
the principle of linguistic activity

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,800
is directly

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,200
related with our language so in the same

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,879
way

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,280
we try to we tend to abstract

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,000
this is not a problem when we talk about

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,199
things or

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,800
birds but when we talk about persons or

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,280
gender issues or right issues is when we

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,400
face

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,720
several problems so it's the same

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
when i use disability word each and

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,439
every one of us

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,200
thinking something different and at the

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,799
same time

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,439
many things the same thing maybe someone

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,360
in a wheelchair or a blind person so the

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,840
interpretation of this world will be

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,280
different

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,080
depending of the people and that's the

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,720
reason

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,159
why it's so complicated to have this

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,400
definition for

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,360
disability some years ago there was a

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,439
glossary

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,799
of translation words somebody a language

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,479
in polynesia

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,840
and there's this waikaka

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,240
and translated to spanish or english

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,240
means

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,520
disability but their vision is to have

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,040
force and skills in another way so

00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,320
this word was a very specific or

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,000
highlight this uh gaining this skill

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,360
so the idea of this glossary for using

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
words without a negative burden and as

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,440
we know

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,959
words child are charged with positive or

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,160
negative things

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,440
so if we are

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,440
if we go to the dictionary so

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,640
disabilities as restriction or

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,200
absence of a capacity in uh

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,319
an activity that it considers normal but

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,519
what is normal

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,760
so base in this definition we

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,680
the the definition of normal something

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,440
that is normal in a culture is not

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,239
necessarily means the same in another

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,480
culture

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:46,400
and another song in another ways

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,519
it's associated with some diseases

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,400
uh the who

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,040
says that also disability talks about

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,519
impediments restriction in the

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,720
participation

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,560
in the day-to-day life and

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,560
limits also the activities

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,360
as we see it's kind of difficult

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
to have just one meaning for this world

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,159
also we have

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,319
this mismatch between the

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,480
skills or abilities of a people and

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,560
their environment so we can say

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,840
so a non-accessible environments

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,319
create impairment or disability and now

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,360
we have accessibility what is this

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,920
is the possibility to access but

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,319
the principle is to reduce or get rid of

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,159
these

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:43,680
barriers that has the disability people

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,440
of the right spaces things information

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,120
etc

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,720
in the web concept accessibility is

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,920
that your product is available for any

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,560
people or person in the world so

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,480
in the translation is this in the

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,840
handbook accessibility guide

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,959
is linked with the universal design

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,400
but why do we have to do this well

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,519
as i already mentioned if you ask me

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,080
this should be because it's the correct

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,280
thing

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,400
but this is not enough if they

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,639
was saying well and it will not

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,160
necessary for me to be here

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,160
but let's understand what is happening

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,880
let's go back a little bit in the time

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,800
on time because the world we live in

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,120
is in a state of constant change

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,160
so the only constant is change a lot of

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,880
years ago

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,880
we needed a whole room to have a

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,160
computer but right now

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,199
this is only in the type of the

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,240
the size of our of our hound

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,600
in other days we saw like that and now

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,720
like these cookies

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,919
banners alerts pop-ups a lot of things

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
in the same screen

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,880
so technology change the web is is

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:09,280
evolved in uh the web is part of our

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,320
everyday life in our job attacks

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,280
learning new things buying things so in

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,720
the pandemic

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,759
times is a super important tool for many

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,960
people

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,160
so we can say that in all this time

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,680
we increase the reach of the technology

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,320
of the internet but at the same time

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,440
is confused and it's accepted is not

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,320
accessible for

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,520
a lot of things as eva mentioned in her

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,800
keynote

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,520
what is this non-profit organization

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,479
they provide solution for this

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,520
accessibility

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:51,199
in 2019 they organize an evaluation

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,120
of the homepage popular homepage

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,080
how do they do that well they use a tool

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,960
and they take the problems in the pages

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
that are not

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,880
aligned with the guidelines of this

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,560
ngo and they compare standards and say

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,520
this is working and this is not working

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,639
but as

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,240
all the tools has the pros and cons

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:18,160
because uh some of them well

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,360
almost at 25 and this is a a great

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,680
figure this is the amount of errors or

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:29,120
mistake almost 60 million

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:31,759
it's an average of 69.6 per wedge

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,759
per page

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,680
and with this 97.8

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,360
of the pages analyzed they had errors

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:47,280
for example instagram facebook forevers

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,120
writers stanford and a lot of more

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,319
this doesn't mean that it's also so

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,520
social media but

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,919
university news pages so it's

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,000
pretty important but why is this

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,919
happening

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,080
as i mentioned before language and how

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,199
we talk and reflect and how we

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,479
interpret things and also i believe that

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,280
we reflect our experience based on what

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,680
our beliefs there's this image of how we

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,680
use

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,120
the computer how do we navigate or

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,400
scroll or or we

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,639
can distinguish the the details

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,639
and there's nothing around us

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:36,720
but this is not real but for some reason

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,840
everything that we do is this option or

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,160
this vision

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,520
in one moment in our life we are going

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,080
to experience

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,720
in a different way because every one of

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,599
us

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,039
experimented the web in different ways

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,599
some of

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,400
people will have difficulties for colors

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,160
other for

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,840
other or pains for example they can use

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,240
the

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,360
mouse or they only

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,879
have just one arm because they are with

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,759
their babies in the other hand so

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,800
there's a lot of

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,199
different options but accessibility

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:16,240
is almost forgotten or ignored we

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,960
wait that somebody complain and then

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,599
maybe we do some changes why because

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,840
many times

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,440
it's a lack of information but now we

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,120
know that it's important

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,599
so how can i do this yeah well i think

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,639
that

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,399
every one of us can afford or do

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,159
something it doesn't matter if you are

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:40,479
tester developer

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:44,000
business area we all can do something so

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,200
let's go and see this let's see what

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,560
the what are the mistakes of the errors

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,920
so my first uh advice is go back to the

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,399
basics

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,040
this framework we think that is going to

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,399
change

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:02,080
our life a new technology but

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,959
up to be updated then we forget the

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,160
basics

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:09,839
so my advice is review this concept

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,399
so the first thing is html

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,360
this must be semantic and with a

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,200
structure

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,760
this means that use the correct tag

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,640
in the correct place we have a lot of

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,000
tags

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,959
headlines articles bottoms inputs and a

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,760
lot of more

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,760
all these tags has their own

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,200
significance and in place

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,399
for example to generate this the dump

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,720
and you modify it and maybe it's useful

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,959
for

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,440
all the technology they handle

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:49,120
information notes because some things

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,480
are just visual so we can say that

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,519
the tree of accessibility is a

00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,000
sub um part of

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,240
the dom and it uses htm

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,760
and their elements are working okay

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,240
because it's the behavior

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,519
it's already established like that so

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,839
when we use

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:15,519
the tag act the browser is like a link

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:18,959
so when we write down our html

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:23,040
we need to know that we are using the

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:25,680
the the tools this is an example

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,399
this is an example div if we need this

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,519
button

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,519
in the screen reader

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,079
they don't know how where where is it or

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
what is it

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,920
so we cannot access with a keyboard if

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,279
we do not

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:45,200
put like an index or the correct

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,760
tool but once we we put inspect with dev

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,120
that we can see that there's not a lot

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,720
of information it's raw

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:58,000
generic so it's just that amount

00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,480
of information but if we have a bottom

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,279
for example roll bottom you know the the

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,240
location

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,760
what is so we can

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,079
[Music]

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,040
have a primary content and with all this

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,680
information

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,079
it can be communicated to the user so

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,800
it's part of our job to decide the

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,800
correct

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:22,240
tag in our html and if we

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,360
are creating a element

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,839
with a visible tag it's okay but you

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,320
need to remember

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,680
accessibility and to test all the roles

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,360
and behaviors

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,519
in order to function correctly and the

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,959
correct location and we are talking

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,000
about structure

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,880
because the order or the navigation or

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,040
the browser

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,480
is according to the code and in logic

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:54,160
so in one study it found out the more

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,160
of 300 000 web pages

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,240
they have problems with headings there

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,440
were and with the headings

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,200
there are some rules

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,680
we need to have h1 and write down the

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,360
page

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,320
and similar and just one and the rest of

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,760
the headings

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,040
is like a tape top index it must be

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,079
presented in the

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,279
different layers or levels

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,120
h1 h2 and then

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,600
maybe at the end h5 and this is

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,040
important because a lot of times

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,519
headings is

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,320
they use the people use these headings

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,440
what

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,200
just to know the idea of the page so if

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,480
this is not in order

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,760
it's confused and the top index we

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,880
use carefully it can be very good or

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,320
very bad

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:52,079
this allows us or help us

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:56,160
some elements for example if we have a

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:59,680
one type index or greater than one

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,360
it's a specific order we don't want to

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,560
play with this

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,800
because the element will be outside of

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,040
the browser if the tab index is zero

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,880
allowed us to have focus from the

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,360
keyboard

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,880
in the order of the browser or

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,639
navigation

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,839
but we need to be sure that the behavior

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,680
when focus and the keyboard is what you

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,680
should do we're doing we can

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,079
for example enter key or space key

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,040
so what happens when we click on those

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,720
keys

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,760
in case of that index equal to 1

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,920
this allowed us that some elements will

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,800
be on focus

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,760
so in general we can say that the

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,120
element

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,600
with the value bigger than one focus

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,600
before elements without index or the

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,279
value is zero

00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:01,680
in the order of the elements

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:05,199
this can change a lot of times we use

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,480
css to change the order of the element

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,720
position absolute

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,839
and this can be confused because there

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,120
are people that

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,800
use screen readers but again

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,839
uh visually see the pages

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,040
so the screen reader will read what is

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,600
the the things that in the order that he

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,079
find it

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,360
but the user is seeing another thing so

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,399
we need to take care

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,399
be careful about this

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,040
and again html cementing and

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,040
structure all the people that are using

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,519
technology or assisted technology

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,880
can be used and with this let's pass to

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,160
focus

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,720
so this is where the elements go in the

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,079
keyboard

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,880
some elements or they are default focus

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,000
focus

00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:00,320
as input or bottoms another's

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,360
like divs or sponge an easy way to

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,160
know of we need focus is just to ask

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,839
ourselves

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,680
can we interact with element if it's yes

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:15,199
we need focus the behavior

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,240
so i somebody can access through

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,440
keyboard

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,720
so for example we have an input we

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,279
normally see this blue box

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,240
and one of the most common mistakes that

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,440
we can

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:34,079
find out is outlined in css

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:37,120
this line that is around the elements

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,759
we take it out because we think it's

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,079
ugly

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,279
it's not according to our design but

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,880
this is a mistake

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:48,160
because when we do that we get rid of

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,639
visual aid in other

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,600
example if we leave it like that it's

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,720
not enough

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,519
because the contrast is not enough or

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,519
maybe the

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,800
font or the color is not good enough

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:06,240
but with css we can do or improve this

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,839
and arrange we have these four

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,600
properties color style with an offset

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,720
that measure the distance of the limit

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,250
of the element

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,639
so we can

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,759
[Music]

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,320
we can put all the things according to

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,000
our

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,399
design and when we use this one

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,759
for example when the people when they

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,600
use the keyboard

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,279
somebody for example with permanent

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,000
paralysis or

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,240
problems in the wrist that he can use

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,959
only the keyboard not the mouse

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,600
so this will be useful for all of them

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,320
another topic which is very important in

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,600
the web is color and contrast

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,959
so when we create products according to

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,040
diversity the election or they choose

00:16:52,959 --> 00:17:00,000
the color and contrast because color

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,839
help users for information or is just

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,880
the color of the brand

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,760
but not all the users

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,360
see the colors in the same way there are

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,720
some people that need

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,839
more help independently of the color

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,640
it doesn't matter if we have the

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,760
most beautiful design in our webpage if

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,679
people can see it

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,280
well like that and about contrast is the

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,319
difference in

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,280
between the color or the representation

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,000
of the object in the screen etc

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,919
for example in the real world the

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,160
difference is illumination

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,280
and the things that are around that but

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,919
in the screen

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,799
we can say the difference between the

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,440
background

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,840
and the text images or whatever it is an

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
example

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:54,000
like this one like this image with all

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,520
the colors

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,760
and we if we apply a

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,039
filter for somebody that has some

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,840
disability in the eyes

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,640
is like this a lot of colors disappear

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,840
there's only

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,120
red blue and something green and when we

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,480
applied

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,880
for sensitivity to red for for example

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,640
people that cannot see the red color is

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,679
totally different

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,880
they will see only yellow and blue

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,720
so if we are trying to communicate

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,840
information to the user only by color

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,520
well it's not enough intrello

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,559
trello they have this color blind

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,760
friendly mode so they put texture

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,880
in these cards without changing color

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,640
just they just add texture so

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,840
people that cannot distinguish

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:53,600
colors they they can note

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,720
the label of each box

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,600
here we see the new york times webpage

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,120
we see all the labels and when we

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,240
applied

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:08,799
a filter how

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:12,000
people will see see things is like that

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,600
is very difficult to read the image are

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,039
not clear enough

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,640
and this is very common for the people

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:25,360
for the the the seniority people

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:28,799
so the content of our page is important

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:34,160
but must need be appreciated

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:37,360
in different condition of light

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,400
and also to be to

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,200
to know that everyone can reach

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,799
our webpage when we talk about color

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,720
contrast

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:52,080
is a text color and the background

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:55,440
so again sensitivity a

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,400
double a and three pull a

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,280
this is a tool this color level that

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,240
measure

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,240
the contrast between two colors in the

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,320
upside or in the upper part

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:12,320
upper part is more strict is 7.21

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:15,440
and the other is failing so this means

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,799
that the colors on the bottom part

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,400
will have some difficulty for somebody

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:25,280
that has some impairment so

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,520
this is in a hip-hop repository at the

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,520
end

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:35,840
i mentioned already text and content

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:39,200
they play a very important role

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,400
because we read the text but not

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,039
everybody reach at the same level or we

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,240
have

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:50,320
the same skills to understand

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:53,600
even though if the text is as simple as

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:57,840
one thing there are people with

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,520
some deficits and this can affect the

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,400
ability to

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,679
understand the text so what can we do in

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,440
this case

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:10,799
well we need to take into account a

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:14,080
simple language with this is

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,880
a logic order the more

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,280
important things at the beginning and

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,120
the context that you are using

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:27,039
definition for none some common words

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,559
so you need to be literally as possible

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:34,400
again thinking those persons that have

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:38,600
cognitive deficiencies this means for

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:42,159
for example sarcomas is

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,720
non-compressible talking about funds

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,159
they are very small fonts and it's very

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,440
difficult to read

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:53,520
so using the correct font

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,440
for example some serif without

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,159
things at the end of the letter so

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,360
everything will be easier to reach

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,400
and to maintain a short

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,640
paragraph because if it's very long it's

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,559
difficult to read

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,760
and if a user must assume

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,280
more than 400 percent the space of the

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,640
text will not change

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,320
all the information must be present

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,320
about talking about icons

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,679
as funds and somebody

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:33,200
is using their own phone

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,840
will replace our phones and everything

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,880
will change

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,640
so also remember

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:44,320
the icons

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,280
and also we need to edit the images

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,640
in the context screen readers cannot

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,440
read the text

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,360
inside the images otherwise we need an

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,760
alternative

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,039
in the case of media what i'm talking

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,720
about are videos

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:04,640
audios podcasts etc

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,120
so if we have this slide in our webpage

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,320
we

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,360
need to have captions or transcriptions

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,960
in captions well is a kind

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,280
of transcript transcription

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,480
or in the same language or different

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,520
language so

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,799
this is very useful for people that

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,000
have problems to listen but also

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:31,520
that it's very common

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,840
nowaday that in social media to

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:39,600
find videos that are reproduced

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:43,919
automatically so all this video

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,919
for example if it's in autoplay can

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:52,080
can distract somebody for example if

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:55,440
somebody has a epilepsia or

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,960
photosensitive it can be a problem

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:02,720
also for screen readers they cannot

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,200
hear what is happening in the video

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,120
the screen reader is talking the video

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,760
is playing and it's very difficult to

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,480
understand

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,279
the information and more or less all the

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,720
content

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:18,000
gift animation videos they need a switch

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:22,880
to turn it off so it must be a decision

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,799
of the user turn it on or turn it off

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,799
and not as mandatory feature

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,600
and last but not least test test

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,480
test automatic test

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,600
can be also for accessibility but it's

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,039
not enough

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,080
so the better thing is manual test

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,520
well with all this knowledge you can

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,120
review

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:52,480
in your web in your page or your

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,679
product to listen our website in mac

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,520
you have voice over in windows you can

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,559
download a screen reader you have a

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,840
chrome voice extension

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,960
and you can use it and let's hear

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,880
what your website said the logic

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:16,480
of your web page and from there

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:20,159
having this sense well what about other

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:23,600
person listening to this another thing

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:26,840
forget the mouse unplug it

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,720
disable and use everything with

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,520
your your key

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,559
board and if everything is accessible

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,799
well with the mouse

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:42,080
also it is and at the end

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,360
who benefit with the accessibility well

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,720
everyone everyone in

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:52,080
some point in our lives

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,720
so take all your product and maybe go to

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,000
the

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,120
the bean trash no no there are some

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,320
things that you need to change and they

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,360
are in the web

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,919
in almost of the website and there is

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,960
a lot of annoyance for many people this

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,240
means that

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,240
small changes can have a big impact

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,080
change all these can help a lot of

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,360
people but this is not

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,240
all it's not only of html

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,120
structure there's a lot of things that

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,080
we can do

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,240
i can be here like three hours of all

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,000
everything that we can do to improve

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:34,240
the web but again this small changes

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,279
are important and my last advice is

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,799
let's say go out of the box

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:44,159
see the world from other perspective

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:47,120
diversify your team hire

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,679
people with some disability and again

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,520
test

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,559
test tests learn from others experience

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,600
and with all that

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,320
knowledge you can put it into practice

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,520
because i believe if all of us can do

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,240
something

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,880
the web can be more accessible inclusive

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,559
among

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:16,159
everybody thank you

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:16,159
