the JavaScript unconference is a

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:30,990
conference by the community for

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:32,520
community they proposed talks the people

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:45,930
vote of the talks and then the most

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:47,190
famous topics will be held so this is

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,350
the third year we are running this

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,110
conference and for the first time we get

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,690
more than 400 participants we got 30

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,190
trucks and the priority of course is

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,250
pretty great we got everything from

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,239
protocols to CSS and everything

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,239
JavaScript related

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,670
you

00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:37,939
Oh what I like about the JavaScript

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,360
community mostly the people already open

00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:44,090
line it and yeah I can just find that

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,460
every conferences great people to talk I

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,049
guess I really like the the fact that we

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,090
have these these long breaks in between

00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:51,500
that it's not sort of like go go go from

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,570
one talk to another we have a couple

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,850
talks and then lunch a couple talks and

00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,530
thinks we can be people talk with them

00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,390
find out what everybody is doing here I

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,369
like the whole package I would stay and

00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,869
I like the style of the conference that

00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:04,610
you don't know what will happen to look

00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:06,789
around it's just basically a bunch of

00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,619
nice people helping each other and

00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:11,540
sharing knowledge it was interesting

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:14,150
that you get a surprise you're coming

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,250
here then some people randomly say hey I

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,280
want to speak about this and then we all

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,230
both about what we want to say so I like

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,970
the spontaneous way of this the

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,280
community is growing it's so interesting

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,319
and conferences like this is a great

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,630
place to learn new things and I don't

00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,099
see the distinction between the people

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,500
who have the knowledge and the people

00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:35,600
who don't so everyone knows something

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,680
and just shared and so it's great all

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,570
the connections that you can do in the

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,579
just in the toes but also outside you

00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,730
know and the main room and meet the

00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:49,250
people talk about their feelings know a

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,019
little bit what they are doing you know

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,480
and it's very informal everything and

00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:57,250
that's what makes gsm conference maybe

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,250
the best conference in europe

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,970
