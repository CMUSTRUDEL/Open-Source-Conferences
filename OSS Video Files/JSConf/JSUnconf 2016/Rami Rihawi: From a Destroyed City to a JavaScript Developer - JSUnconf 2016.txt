00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,740
that you've shown in my my my proposal I

00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,450
didn't think that today I will be

00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:34,170
presenting and but here am i and I just

00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,010
did the I am sorry for the crappy

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:42,250
presentation because I just did it in

00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:45,130
the last hour and okay so I am from I

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:50,320
just came to Germany like before five

00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:52,840
years five five months ago and and I

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,460
came exactly from the city of Aleppo

00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,890
which is the heart of the world that's

00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:01,840
going on right now as you as you know

00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:04,360
and this is my city it's a lovely City

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,160
before the war I don't know why I told

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:12,820
you it's presentation okay

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:18,040
and this is our like awesome great

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:23,970
castle of Aleppo and this is my city

00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:30,240
right now after the war as you see it

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:34,240
it's totally destroyed also here again

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,549
but I'm not showing you those photos -

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,600
like - because every time I read an

00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:43,630
article regarding refugees the the guys

00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,729
that make our write those articles they

00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,500
are like really like most of the time

00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:50,369
they are really sweet and awesome but

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,479
they tend to tell stories that are

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,920
emotional and sentimental just to make

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,750
the people you know feel sorry this is

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,909
not my intention at all and to be

00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,460
bluntly honest I really don't like it

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:03,250
when somebody comes at me and just and

00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:08,350
just speaks in a like his feels like

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:14,110
really sorry so I don't want you to feel

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:17,380
sorry but I actually my intention was

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,090
maybe and hopefully to change the way

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,740
you look and see refugees here in

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,129
Germany as you may there is a lot of as

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,650
you may have known

00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:26,569
there's a lot of controversy regarding

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,769
the refugees that the huge amount of

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:33,430
images that are coming to Germany and I

00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:37,249
just hope by giving this representation

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:40,250
to make make you maybe feel like the

00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:42,590
refugees can be a can be a huge

00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,950
opportunity for Germany and if they are

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,319
put in the right use and they can really

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,359
help push the economic wheel of this

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,090
really awesome country that I literally

00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:55,909
fallen in love with over the last five

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,959
months and I really like consider it as

00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,959
my second home right now

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:12,139
well so you saw the the the photos of my

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:15,099
city Aleppo so I you may think like here

00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:19,430
you know the it's not a five star living

00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:20,629
there is no electricity so if you are a

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,819
programmer I guess you need some

00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:25,069
electricity too but there is no

00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:26,750
electricity at all and you can't Google

00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,810
anything and most of the work that I do

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,310
is always googling stuff because that's

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,069
the way how I work and I think most of

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,169
you guys also work the same so there is

00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:38,689
no electricity there is no water and you

00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:41,870
have to do like every I I used to hate

00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:44,750
this like every morning I have to go and

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,099
just bring water from a place where

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,509
there is so many people but I have to

00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:50,000
find a way to come where there is not so

00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:53,900
many people and just bring water for

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,889
this day and mmm I told you so I mean

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,959
there is no if you see there's no

00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:57,769
internet and there is no water but what

00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,840
was I doing there

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,669
I stayed there actually I was there in

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,290
Aleppo when the war actually started

00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:08,750
when I was 17 years old I was there we

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,129
have you know like this at the last year

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,310
of high school where you have to be do

00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:14,870
this big exam in Syria and you have to

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,159
study really really hard for like one

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,400
year so if you want to get into a good

00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:22,669
faculty so at this time when I was

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,509
preparing for this because I want you to

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,219
you know to study informatics

00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:26,570
engineering and you have to bring very

00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:29,780
high marks so you can get into this

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:32,630
faculty in Syria and just so you know

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:35,250
actually many people in Syria many

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,490
attendees of the informatics faculty are

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,830
our woman here in Berlin I'm right now

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,900
guest student in Berlin and it's the

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:47,550
opposite most of them are guys so I

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,340
don't expect that so what was I doing I

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,500
was playing games most of the time like

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:57,180
those two just switching between the

00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:00,030
richer and the GTA and so this and I was

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,370
learning at the University C++ object

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,890
oriented programming and Java and some

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,130
algorithms but we were learning so many

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,740
theoretical stuff like dirt math linear

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:14,400
algebra probabilities all of those crazy

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,560
stuff and I really as you may think I

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,410
didn't enjoy them very well because you

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,840
see nothing you just abstract so Unreal

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,580
Engine came out at the same time I was

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,710
studying those things in Syria where we

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,900
had internet for life I guess I was

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,380
lucky at the summer we had internet it

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:35,010
was really slow but it was okay so the

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,410
Unreal Engine 4 was introduced and I had

00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,800
I was reading I wanted to apply the C++

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:43,050
so I read about 3d stuff like maybe

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,370
using unity or Unreal Engine but then

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,710
Unreal Engine 1 because he is using a C+

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:52,050
so I try to make games that I thought I

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:56,100
can make a triple a game maybe like Mass

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:59,180
Effect alone and in three months well I

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,580
guess that didn't work very well and

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,340
yeah so I made a little game do you like

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,390
the zombies took out our our University

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,310
and you're gonna have to try to kick

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,670
them out the the characters didn't have

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:17,040
really a good look because but it was ok

00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:18,720
it worked fine and yeah I was just at

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,460
that time of the world people outside

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,770
are fighting I was playing GTA was funny

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,090
because the voices are mixed some voices

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,400
you hear from outside and some voices

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:30,030
from GTA and its really good quite quite

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,480
sounds good sound effects and like I

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,520
didn't have those 3d like speed

00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,440
supporters but it was really cool like

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,850
when you hear the blue it's really like

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,680
a huge boom so that was the way I was

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,430
spending my time and like going to

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,169
learning math learning some Java and

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,910
staying at home watching The Walking

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:51,980
Dead Game of Thrones and playing those

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,790
games and developing Unreal Engine so

00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:58,100
that's what I was doing then one day I

00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,990
was there at university we always used

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,229
to go to the architecture faculty

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,699
because there most of the hot girls and

00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:06,770
hot guys they go all there and they

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:11,870
would try to meet each other and you

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:13,669
know do whatever they want to do and so

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,229
one of my friends we were there sitting

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:16,970
like just checking this girl out and

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:18,770
then he tells me well you know actually

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,290
I have this crazy idea we should get out

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,880
of here like we weren't doing nothing in

00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,530
Aleppo I don't know what do you mean

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,630
what do what we are doing some stuff he

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,720
told me well well we can do something

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:32,840
better here in Europe and he is like

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,610
that that time no no no refugees like

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,990
this huge amount of people were coming

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,330
and nobody knew about this idea so I

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,370
thought he was stupid like I'm in Syria

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,020
I'm gonna go and just go what I'm gonna

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,750
make take a visa or just what I'm gonna

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,060
I'm gonna fly take a rocket I can't come

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,130
here this is impossible he is crazy yeah

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,860
I didn't give give him much attention

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,510
and then after two months he comes to me

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,950
and tells me I'm gonna say goodbye to

00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,020
you right now I'm gonna try my luck and

00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,780
I'm gonna go to Germany but tell him

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,639
really and I I took it as a laughs I

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,760
think he's gonna come back maybe in one

00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:09,940
week and he'll have spent so much money

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:14,510
on nothing and he'll lately later regret

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:17,300
but in 30 days he is in Germany he is

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,520
taking photos in Berlin so that was

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,250
really like a huge shock to me that was

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,260
as you may have mentioned that was

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,789
before all of those crazy people were

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,110
coming and millions and millions of I

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:28,760
don't know if refugees were coming and

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:34,430
it's all over the news that was all

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:36,229
before that so I started like he put

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:40,099
this idea in my mind and I started

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,599
asking my parents as you know I was when

00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:46,010
I started asking them I was 20 right now

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,620
in 21 so I like I need I can you I want

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:52,700
to go to Germany you know what are you

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:55,160
talking about just just yeah just get

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,060
past the eyeliner algebra and then we'll

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:03,250
talk about it and then

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:05,410
and then summer car came and so many

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,180
people were the news everybody we're

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,670
talking about how all of those people

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,730
are all of those refugees are coming to

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,140
Europe and they were like so awesome

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,590
here like as you see our Europe is

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:21,340
without borders and then this refugees

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:25,150
welcome stuff so the idea wasn't really

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:28,060
that crazy then my father started you

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:30,730
know thinking about it one of you huge

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,850
one of the huge barriers also was the

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,330
money because you needed my father is a

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,670
lawyer

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:40,170
but you know right now there is no law

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:45,160
in Syria I guess and a lawyer wouldn't

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:47,230
work as well as before you know this

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,550
destruction I wasn't living there I was

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,130
living here in the same city but it is

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,980
you know separated so I was I was lucky

00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,960
and to be living in a another part of

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,560
the city that is more fortunate that it

00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:03,910
is a bit more safe so to say like only

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:08,410
one rocket today and then then he

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:12,070
actually agreed I don't know how like as

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm okay you need maybe two thousand

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:19,240
dollars to to make the trip and then he

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:22,330
agreed and then I told him can I take my

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,710
brother because my brother with me he

00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,930
told me now if you want to try this you

00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,880
will try this on your own and before he

00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,160
changed my mind I just did I took

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,170
everything I packed my stuff and I was

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:37,780
out and I didn't believe it I thought

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:39,400
like Oh God really then I took the the I

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,290
got out of Syria which was really the

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,030
hardest part the sea was nothing I also

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,850
I told my father actually one of the way

00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,440
that I I convinced him I told him if you

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,940
don't let me go I'm gonna go just

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,710
because you know the most money was

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:56,020
gonna go to the guys that put you in

00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:57,190
this boat like 1200 for them so if you

00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,390
don't want to give me the money just

00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,740
give me less I will go swimming I'm a

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,200
really good swimmer eyes in five guys

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,300
five five hours a day I can go swimming

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,560
you can see I mean the island it's just

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,050
over there and I guess he

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,970
and then after you get to Greece you

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,819
start you know sneaking across the

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:19,620
borders and just getting a country of

00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:20,579
three country and then after 15 16 days

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,220
I'm here in Berlin

00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:25,170
well I didn't come to Berlin at first I

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,329
didn't think I'd come to Germany I was

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,699

00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,149
well thank God I know I watched Game of

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,350
Thrones and Walking Dead and I learned

00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:45,860
some English instead of argument and so

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:49,640
I had to do the obvious thing and try to

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:52,970
learn German and well this is just a

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:55,370
joke yes yet if I steal guns good

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:58,310
Deutsche ba exists all finished

00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,730
zu good Wow her Science Nouveau for to

00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,730
Oberlin

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,230
well thank you but it is really hope

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,660
it's it's not good okay

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:18,450
my you can ask my teacher she will tell

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:22,620
you and then well learning German German

00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:25,080
would take much of your time but my my

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,310
passion I didn't come to Germany just to

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,490
learn German I want to continue

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:32,010
programming so but I didn't have I had a

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,650
really cool rig back in Syria I got a

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:37,110
computer like with GPU GTX I don't know

00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,400
what I forgot 560 it was really good rig

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,920
but here I don't have a laptop and I

00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,930
don't have a PC I'm not gonna take my

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:49,890
rig with me in the boat and just come

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:52,110
over here so I thought about it I

00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:56,550
thought about it it's a really good

00:14:52,110 --> 00:15:00,780
drink but they would take much money to

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:05,790
bring it it would be a person so a good

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:07,740
friend of mine that that I got to know

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,770
orange and Berlin just two weeks after

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,210
three weeks and I'm in Berlin she sends

00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,120
me a message or sends my friend a

00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,070
message and then he sends me the message

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,650
there she says that there is this new

00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:22,710
school it's called ready school which

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:27,050
will give laptops for for you guys and

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:29,340
for everybody not only mostly refugees

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,170
it will give you laptops they're not the

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:35,910
best laptops this is their laptop that

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:38,580
they give me that they gave me and they

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,990
will teach you programming if you are if

00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,880
you already know some programming there

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,680
is an advanced course and if you are

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,010
total beginner there is a beginner

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,330
course so I say well I don't think that

00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,520
they're gonna give me a laptop but I

00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:53,370
will go I have only German I will go

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,460
there and try my luck so I go and after

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:59,940
two months they opened the school it was

00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,890
really just the beginning they were just

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,680
far they are trying to figure the idea

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:09,680
that school is going to work and they

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,680
decided to teach us Ruby on Rails

00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:13,910
and they made a good argument about it

00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:17,600
and I said well you're going to teach us

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,459
to be on wheels it's okay and we go we

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,689
start learning Ruby on Rails and they

00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:23,089
bring mentors you know the mentors

00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:26,889
they're gonna they are volunteers that

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:31,939
just wanna spread the knowledge and then

00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:33,529
there is this - guys the what - every

00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:34,999
time there is a mentor every like there

00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:41,179
is different mentor we have three

00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:43,429
classes a week and this mentor thinks

00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:48,129
meteor is better and thinks JavaScript

00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:51,169
is better and his name is Peter and he

00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:52,910
instead he he tells the people at the

00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:55,850
school we are learning Ruby on Rails but

00:16:52,910 --> 00:17:03,619
in the in the session we are learning

00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:06,620
JavaScript I mean I mean when I when she

00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:08,089
asked they asked me the like hey so how

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,480
is it going with you guys with the Ruby

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,630
on Rails

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,549
well I we are learning JavaScript well

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,850
really well we have to talk with this

00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:22,279
guy and then I got him fired no no no

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:24,260
I'm just kidding and yeah so I liked

00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,389
JavaScript actually more than Ruby on

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,549
Rails and I really enjoyed meteor

00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:31,480
because you can make stuff very fast and

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:35,630
see the results in front of you and the

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:39,169
my first project or no not now I will

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:44,179
talk about later so as I became a member

00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:46,519
of this school I we had a lot of fun we

00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:50,090
did really amazing stuff we talked at

00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:52,250
Cisco live and this is an we presented

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,880
together at Cisco live Berlin this year

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:59,779
2016 and we talked about what we've done

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,159
at the at the course and how is like the

00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:06,549
school working and stuff and it was

00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:10,630
really an amazing presentation but then

00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:12,559
mr. Mark Zuckerberg was at Berlin and

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,929
before the day before it

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,700
I was sleeping late like I don't sleep

00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:20,240
late but I was sleeping late till 3:00

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,160
p.m. like really really late and then I

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,200
wake up and I check my

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,860
phone and I see like it's exploding with

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,080
messages and like many people are

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:33,170
calling me and I don't get those kind of

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,470
messages and calls on normal day and

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:38,870
then I like I I am really sleepy I just

00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,610
yeah what do you want guys what is wrong

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,500
everybody is just calling me well you're

00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,880

00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,260
not gonna tell you who is I didn't know

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,940
really like influential and stuff and I

00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:59,060
thought I'm gonna be meeting miracle or

00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:01,160
somebody I don't know and then but so I

00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,230
go and I asked a friend of mine in there

00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,030

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,490
told them like tell me Who am I gonna

00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:13,070
you tell you that it will not happen so

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:16,160
I asked a friend of mine who is also in

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,690
the and the school and she knows and she

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,040
told me yeah I don't tell anybody but

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:26,120
it's gonna be Mark Zuckerberg and then

00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:28,820
III tell everybody and I didn't even met

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,290
him and it may not work but like I have

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,780
been calling everybody even in Syria

00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,860
like people in new yellow man I think

00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,170
I'm gonna be meeting Mark Zuckerberg

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,030
tomorrow well they told me not to see

00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,850
anybody so please don't tell anybody so

00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:43,280
and then he's telling other people so on

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,970
the next day actually all of this talk

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,580
they didn't get this and I met him and

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,190
we had a good talk about virtual reality

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,900
and about like if I asked him the normal

00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,030
question that everybody asks him should

00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,540
I continue college and stuff like

00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:02,570
regarding that he didn't and yeah it was

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:05,990
a good half an hour and we discussed

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,850
many stuff like JavaScript a thing that

00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:11,330
I'm the stuff and that I'm learning and

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:14,180
Unreal Engine and he yes and he actually

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,770
told me to use it's a good idea to use

00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:22,030
Unreal Engine to develop stuff for the

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:25,670
VR and then this is a crazy photo of me

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,470
well I thought I was then working on

00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,680
meteor to make a site for the already

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:34,640
school it's not deployed or saw anything

00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,420
I just was doing at trying to you like

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,300
better

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:41,150
my knowledge using the JavaScript and

00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,820
meteor and I I don't know why I did I

00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:46,100
think that one laptop wasn't enough and

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,350
I don't know and actually my friend also

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,000
the one who is helping me thought the

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:54,800
same thing that one laptop ain't enough

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,610
and so we actually made a media website

00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:02,120
that has you know like registration and

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:03,980
user interface and like a profile pages

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,320
for everybody is like a mini Facebook

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:14,390
and in use feed and stuff using MongoDB

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:18,560
and Ruby JavaScript and meat here and it

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:22,760
was actually good for like I did it in

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:24,830
actually three weeks just refreshing my

00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,110
memories about the pay basics and then

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,640
learning the meteor and JavaScript and

00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:32,840
MongoDB because I have no idea about

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,950
databases and we made the side the

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:42,440
source is not is not pretty but it works

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:45,710
and then before two days ago

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,590
we were having a discussion with well 20

00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:51,230
and 24 we were going to also make a

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:54,380
webpage on their side like not whole

00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,960
page menus many web pages like it's a

00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:00,350
mini site in their site

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:05,260
- yeah using javascript and using meat

00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:08,540
here and I will be also continuing

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:11,030
studying at tio Berlin and trying to

00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,680
learn I'm not studying like I am right

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:17,030
now you know trying to learn the

00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,470
language I understand many like 60% e %

00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:22,250
of the what's the professor is saying

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:24,710
but I still need more and I will not be

00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,080
official until I have a certain level so

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:33,310

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:35,540
and thank you guys very much for your

chance to present this this story and I

hope that you liked it and if you have

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,940
any I don't know

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:50,880
we have yeah we still have time I guess

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:53,429
I thought it would take more yeah if you

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,340
have any questions or anything I'd be

00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:58,549
happy to answer them or try to answer

00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,549
them

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,750
like

00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:20,070
well this is actually the first time I

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,080
hear is that human because I wouldn't be

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:25,289
given a visa or anybody I mean I'm not a

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,650
super techy guy but maybe I will earn

00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:31,830
fast I guess but regarding the second

00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:34,950
question I know that there is like

00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,450
43,000 job opportunities for programmers

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,690
here in Germany that are not fulfilled

00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:42,120
and they need anybody who who can do

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:45,750
this any job and I so like many people

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,460
came to our many companies came to our

00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,929
school and they asked us and we are

00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:54,350
still learning and the ask has just come

00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:57,240
you will learn on the job well it's not

00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,130
well what do you think so many the

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,320
system is not working I guess very well

00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:04,380
when because I think there is many

00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,679
refugees that are coming but I mean I

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:11,070
did I don't have a residency until now

00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,659
nobody like many people who don't know

00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,580
don't can't can't speak English can't

00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,409
program anything can't do anything

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,640
they got the residency they are just

00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,890
like me also from Syria or other

00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,870
countries I think they are refugees they

00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,780
got the residency and now they can go to

00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,940
the do any place to work or anything but

00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:31,440
I'm I can work actually do actual work

00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:33,960
but I I'm not allowed to work so this is

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,700
the the problem like I'm not allowed to

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:41,540
work and I am NOT also given any

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:44,720
residency and what was the first

00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,910
yeah so many people is there many guys

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,980
just like me yes there is many guys but

00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,080
they're in the shadows because many

00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,640
doctors are living in camps I saw many

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,150
doctors that are ready just to work with

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,010
it many engineers the mechanical

00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,350
engineers many many many people with

00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:01,850
educated they are already finished there

00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:07,820
they have their degree with them they

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:12,200
are ready as our school and but they

00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:14,750
didn't like they didn't get any help or

00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,190
any or any like nobody helped them they

00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,730
they were helped but they didn't get the

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:22,730
residency to help Germany to help the

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,470
economic wheel that's the problem and

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:27,470
there is many people yes there is a I'm

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,910
not gonna I want to be very honest I'm

00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,470
not going to tell you all those all the

00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:35,420
refugees that came they are really

00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:38,570
educated they are like no no not all of

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:42,410
them and the majority are not I want to

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:44,180
be honest but not everybody not

00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:46,340
everybody that came here needs to be a

00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:50,810
tech guy or needs to be a doctor or

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:53,660
needs to they can work any other job to

00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:55,250
just to not be a burden on Germany to

00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,690
not keep on taking money I don't like

00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:59,710
taking money from the government but

00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:03,110
they will not let me work and other

00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:05,420
people would like to work but they are

00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,670
by they didn't learn the language this

00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,700
is their fault and they didn't get

00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:13,270
offered to learn a language that's all

00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:16,280
so I think maybe the government is full

00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:18,400
if there is any I hope I answered your

00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,400
