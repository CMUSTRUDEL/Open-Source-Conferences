yeah hello everybody didn't expect that

00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,679
many people to my first days unconscious

00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:20,060
talk

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,759
over here yeah hacking games and why

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,560
should you do it

00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:28,039
most of us started learning programming

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,960
by ourselves at home reading books or

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,660
magazines and then the internet came and

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,400
we learned everything there and but I

00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,080
think we can agree on that we actually

00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,480
learn the most while we are debugging

00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,339
and searching from box and browsing the

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,470
code and really try to understand what

00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:44,030
we actually did there because while

00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,620
we're coding we kind of know what we're

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,089
doing and we just type it down in the

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,470
end everything works we're happy and

00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:54,320
never see the file again and yeah and I

00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,780
also really like games and what I do in

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,600
my free time is except fun apart from

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,330
programming games I check out games

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,220
online and try to see their code and how

00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,030
they solve the problems they had and how

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:10,640
I can manipulate that to my advantage so

00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:12,350
what do you see here this is a game I

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,560
actually made myself kind of a

00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:19,280
proof-of-concept thing I made this back

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,470
when this candy box thing went why were

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,180
probably you know that game where you

00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,320
get candy and you can eat all the candy

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,270
and then you get a sword and you get

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,970
quests and the Frog comes and you can

00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,320
answer all the questions and so what do

00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,510
you have to do here it's a very simple

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,700
game the goal is to become a millionaire

00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:37,940
and you have 20 gold and you can mine

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
gold so it's a classic clicker game and

00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,560
it's also an idol game because you can

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,540
use your goal gold to buy a miner

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,960
so here's Pete he's just working in the

00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,900
mind and every 5 gold or so he puts his

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,729
gold into my pocket and he's working and

00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,710
he has an efficiency and I can use my

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:55,070
goal to upgrade Pete or I can use my

00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,590
gold

00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,020
- hi another miner so if I don't want to

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,720
wait and so Peter is has mined all the

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,570
gold I just click here very rapidly and

00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,460
now I buy a second miner and click again

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,530
again ok that's a hundred that takes too

00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,140
much time now I'm already bored and I

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,530
want the game to progress faster so what

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,010
do I do

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,290
first thing is I check the sources so

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,260
there's a JavaScript folder and there's

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,079
an index.html that's the easiest way to

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,569
start just go there and check for any

00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:28,540
scripts so there's one script check

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:30,939
loading required yes

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:40,120
and data - loading the edges so I might

00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:46,030
want to check out the fjs not to game.js

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:49,150
where's the FJ jeaious asd there's no HS

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,549
so maybe it's the game J's maybe I don't

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,709
know my code as well so I checked the

00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:55,629
code in a browser code and I can set

00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:59,650
some breakpoints of course that would be

00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:01,900
the easiest approach or I can check if

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,400
there's something like access to the

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,450
window object when a game object to

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,799
store this is obviously on purpose yeah

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,239
but the much more easier approaches I

00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,209
know I can click this button to get some

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,190
gold so why don't I just inspect it and

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,879
see if it has an ID or it has an ID and

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:22,720
just take that and hopefully jQuery is

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,819
installed and looks like it is I have to

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,599
code with one hand now that's a little

00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:33,430
bit difficult like that okay I get it

00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:33,970
and I can run the click function did it

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,480
work

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:41,889
and it looks like it works okay now the

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:45,780
tricky stuff set interval and then I

00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:50,410
pass in a function and then I take the

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,480
button like that and and I do click and

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:59,440
because I don't want to wait that long

00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:01,389
ah there's the syntax error I just don't

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,220
pass any value into the set interval

00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,959
function with Mason on really fast and

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,799
now I get all the goals I want and I can

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:13,180
buy all the - I need and now I just have

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,889
to wait okay I actually came depending

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,600
on my memory on my local machine I can

00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:20,940
run this couple times more

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,980
and those increases Madchester and now

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,660
apparently I got all the minor so now I

00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,600
can work on the efficiency so they are

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,850
better at mining but still now we would

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,890
wait like ten minutes to get all them 1

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,660
million and actually tested it when you

00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,370
only have the - and you don't cheat and

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,310
you have all the - and no efficiency

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,050
upgrade it takes like 24 hours for them

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,800
to mine all the 1 million but that's

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:46,290
obviously too much time so what can we

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,740
do we know we have to become a

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,560
millionaire

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,330
and we already check the source and so

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,990
that oh there's the PETA object in the

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,910
window so you might want to inspect that

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,970
Pete so it looks like a backbone view

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,620
because it obviously is and what do I

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,300
have you have an event lock I don't care

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,890
for that I have improvements or whatever

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,870
I never saw that actually that's a

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,840
feature I put in and then put it out

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,240
again so we don't care for that I have

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,620
miners which is an area where all my -

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,720
restored but I don't care for them

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,810
because they're too slow and their stats

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,910
Oh instead looks very nice so I have a

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,830
back size probably the size of the

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,200
miners and when they put their gold into

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,870
my storage don't care much for that and

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,810
I have the state of my current gold this

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,600
is very nice so let me quickly reload

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,390
that to make it more obvious what

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,540
happens now I can use Pete and then

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:41,070
stats this is the third subject I could

00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,700
easily try to say oh there's a one

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,390
property I put it to true and what

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,460
happens next

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,890
hmm seems like nothing happened except

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,320
that I can't really do anything

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:55,320
so probably the games check that I win

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,900
that didn't make a proper response what

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,520
else can I do

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:05,580
there's gold ah that sounds nice so Pete

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,450
dot stats dot gold equals nine nine nine

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,480
nine nine zero okay that worked

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,310
obviously and now I try to click it for

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,940
ten times I have the patience for that

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,200
actually nice I won the game very good I

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,000
don't have to play it anymore I know all

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,410
the features but that's something I

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,700
programmed myself that was pretty easy

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:30,690
to hack now try a real example I already

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,490
talked about candy box there's when you

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,590
first load the page you only see

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,849
and is increasing over time and suddenly

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,009
there appears a baton where I can eat

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,139
all the candy and nothing happened

00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:43,470
except for a text that I ate nine

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,330
candies and on my first try of this game

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,770
I just clicked it over and over again in

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,990
the hope that something would change but

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,039
actually nothing changed you have to

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,789
wait until they're like a hundred

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,259
candies and the next button appears and

00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:56,970
the game kinda explode from there you

00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,910
get more and more features or I can

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,919
throw pennies on the ground I can do

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,650
that much more often and sometimes there

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,020
will be a unhappy smiley face there and

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,340
it changes depending on how many candy

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,919
you can throw on the ground you throw on

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,050
the ground so but I don't want to wait

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,449
here and I want to improve that as well

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,240
so I check the sources again and see

00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:22,440
there's a scripts folder and there's

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,449
lots of streets so many scripts so when

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,720
I come to a situation where I have that

00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:30,750
many scripts I try something else first

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,909
because most game developers to be able

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,349
to debug their game while it's running

00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:36,030
and to manipulator to test if

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:38,520
everything's working they expose the

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,919
game object like I did with Pete so I

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,270
check for game what's the first thing I

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,949
do

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,750
there's no game unfortunately maybe

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:50,460
they've got clever and had the capital G

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:52,830
but that nah doesn't seem to work as

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:58,500
well so I'm screwed and I have to check

00:07:52,830 --> 00:08:00,690
the source again and check for something

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,280
candies candy sounds very good because I

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,650
get candies and I would assume that

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,039
something happening where the candies is

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,780
in the candies J s and here in the

00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,030
script I see that the bar statement for

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,860
the candies object is directly in the

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,580
file so I know it's on the global scope

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,469
and I try that out and let's see if

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,650
there's actually a candy and there is a

00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:26,039
candies object so what do I got here and

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,810
that console suck I got candies per

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,310
second oh that sounds very interesting

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:35,219
let's try that

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:40,740
candies dot candies per second equals 2

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:43,409
1 3 3 7 marvelous so I don't want to

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,350
wait that long so try to explore that a

00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,910
little bit and make the game progress

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,650
first there's the merchants you have to

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,050
wait until you got Hoonah candies so in

00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,520
that 100 I can buy the wooden sword now

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,840
and the couple sword and the iron sword

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,510
and the service hole in the diamond

00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,840
sword I can use 101 candies to encrust

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:03,390
it and now in my inventory I have the

00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,340
candy diamond sword usually for the

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,850
first quest peaceful forest I only have

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:11,250
to kill trees the wooden sword would be

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,930
enough but it is much more faster with

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,060
them and so because they immediately die

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,210
and I can progress through the quests

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,790
the extra goal is to beat all the quests

00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,230
there's like 14 quest I think and

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,620
there's even one quest where the end

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,620
pose is the developer I only beat that

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,810
level by putting a breakpoint into the

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:38,340
game and setting the HP of the developer

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:41,100
to zero but it worked and since the coat

00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,440
is so nice and clean and not mini fight

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,980
and it obfuscated it's very easy to to

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,540
heck obviously the developer of that

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,910
game realized that and made some

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,940
improvements and candy box too so this

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:57,180
is the sequel to candy box and it's

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,860
basically the same game there's lots of

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,380
more features and some changes in the

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:09,090
game and if we check these sources again

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:12,300
we find the candy box to J's so oh

00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:15,810
that will take more time to heck

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,270
actually but on chrome there's this nice

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:22,280
button in the left here called pretty

00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:24,570
print and pretty print pretty prints

00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,330
obfuscated code so it's better readable

00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,910
it doesn't change the variable names

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,930
unless you get access to the net file

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,870
unfortunately I don't have access to the

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,430
nab file because the deployed version of

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,500
the JavaScript doesn't include the death

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,780
map tech which is very good for him

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,370
obviously he realized that something or

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,570
she that players hacked the game and

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,070
yeah and now I can start putting

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,110
breakpoints on here and beat the game as

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,300
well but I don't want to export the

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,960
second candy box I just want to actually

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,390
want to show you another game cookie

00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,080
clicker probably many of you know the

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,080
game cookie clicker

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:10,810
come on obviously this is some safe game

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:20,130
no I don't want to can i reset the game

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:24,640
somewhere settings options options wipe

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:26,370
very good do it okay cuca click has a

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,779
very nice game

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,230
there's the cookie you click it you get

00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:32,500
the cookie

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,900
and when you have 15 cookies to get a

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,270
cursor which means now I get zero point

00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,279
one cookie per second and I can click

00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,980
over and open open open oval again and I

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,010
can buy a second cursor when I have 100

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:48,450
cookies I get the grandma and then I get

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,250
the factory and the cookie farm and some

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,720
quantum physics operating machine who

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,420
does like a trillion cookies a second

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,100
but you know me I'm not very patient

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,700
when it comes to games I want to see

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,710
everything right away and I tried the

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,050
first thing again which I did with the

00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,780
Pete game yeah I check out the button

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:10,839
and then for fortunately this is a just

00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:13,450
plain hot email HTML and JavaScript

00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,970
flash games are not that easy to hack

00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,010
you would need to like use some kind of

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,220
tool for that but I don't like that

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:25,420
and yeah this is a button again with the

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:29,080
IDE and I think we can try out if I am

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:35,430
able to do the same trick I did with

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:44,130
Pete so I have the jQuery here right yes

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:47,730
and then now we get the big cookie and

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:52,030
that works as well and I can click it I

00:12:47,730 --> 00:13:00,660
can click it so the rest is easy set

00:12:52,030 --> 00:13:00,660
interval German keyboards

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:12,080
boom nice so that is very good but yeah

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,540
the achievements are popping all over

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,430
this place I'm so good I get all the

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,620
achievements and now I can buy a time

00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:23,360
directly without having to have a

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:26,029
grandma but you can imagine there's

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,500
quite some objects here and the list

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:33,020
grows and grows it only shows you the

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:37,339
next two so I'm patient as I am let's

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:40,660
check the source code if we can speed

00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:45,320
this process up there's some main.js and

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:48,970
the main J s is quite some fire lots of

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,930
lines were your markup game code

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:54,550
interesting game girls and they all

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:57,770
explain very nice thank you very much

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,339
cookies earn cookies cookies PS is

00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:03,490
probably cookies per second cookie

00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:06,230
frenzy frenzy max power clique frenzy

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,240
golden cliques sometimes there appears

00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,680
like a golden thingy here and I can

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,230
click it and I get some extra cookies

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,170
but what I'm actually interested in is

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,029
if there's the possibility to manipulate

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,150
the buildings directly instead of you

00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:21,890
know clicking the button automatically

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:26,480
so let's check out the console if we

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:28,250
have some kind of game object again okay

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,680
that's a diff container don't care for

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,529
that oh and there is a game object is it

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:38,360
the right one let's see oh that looks

00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:40,959
very nice so what do we got here we got

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,190
big cookie sighs we got can click

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,650
interesting so there's obviously some

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,990
kind of cheat prevention maybe this gets

00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:50,450
set to zero when you click so that it's

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,700
preventing you from clicking thousands

00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,730
of times per second but obviously it

00:14:52,700 --> 00:15:04,930
doesn't do the job very good

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:04,930
and let's see objects by ID what's that

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:10,760
how to clicks once every 10 seconds

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:14,990
cursor so that's obviously the buildings

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:17,210
and there's 14 of them so the best

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:21,170
podium probably is the last one

00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:25,040
and the array and the numbers look quite

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:27,830
nice they're in very many zeroes the

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,130
prism converts light itself into cookies

00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:33,500
yeah that's what I'm going for but to

00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,050
make sure what are the values I can set

00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,830
so there is an amount and there is

00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:42,380
bought and attract us once if you only

00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,900
update one of those values it does

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:48,710
nothing because the game internally

00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:51,950
checks and match see if those numbers

00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,990
match to see if the user cheated so what

00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,950
we have to do is we have to increase

00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:03,410
both of them okay let's try that so it

00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:08,390
was game object by ID then we got 14 so

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:14,120
I need 13 and then amount equals some

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:28,370
crazy biggest number and then the same

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:29,920
number for game object 13.4 and I think

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:35,170
I broke it

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:38,980
yeah happens from time to time oh snap

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:43,070
if you get too crazy with the numbers

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:48,770
the game's kind of crash so maybe we try

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:52,310
a thousand that works much better and

00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:54,890
the achievements are rolling in again so

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,000
let's quickly just close it see if

00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,900
everything's correct

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,610
I get the prism a thousand times great

00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,500
and I get two point nine trillion

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:07,990
cookies per second

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:11,110
that's something I can work with for my

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:17,049
next game anyone here working at game

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:21,100
porch no great anyone working at big

00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:25,829
point you would like that no okay I used

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:28,860
to work at both the next game is Oh game

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:32,770
this is a very classic browser game

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:34,600
which actually works with PHP which

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,970
means most of the clicks you do trigger

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,650
a refresh of the page which is very

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,330
unfortunate because I cannot run myself

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,100
interval stuff or anything like that

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,960
because if I actually do an interaction

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:49,720
with the game the page gets reloaded my

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:51,250
script is gone and to of course when the

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,020
page is reloaded this request to the

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:57,250
server they validate stuff you do so

00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:59,950
there's not much to actually sheet to

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,419
progress in the game and that's good

00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,919
because that's a multiplayer game and

00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:04,659
singer player games developers users

00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:06,940
don't care about preventing players to

00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:08,890
cheat because why should they there is

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,530
no competition with other players and

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,210
you don't necessarily need to prevent

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,669
the cheating thing unless you have

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,919
something like a competition which is

00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:19,960
where you collect the stats and you see

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,850
okay the best player of my game actually

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,860
wins something then you want to prevent

00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,169
cheating but unless you don't have that

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,590
don't care about it people will do it

00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:28,390
anyway

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,940
there's the cheat engine where you can

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,500
read the memory stats and it's a waste

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,130
of time if you just do a single player

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,840
game and for this game I had to actually

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,679
play it a little bit I played the back

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,150
in 2000 I don't know 4 or something

00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,650
because there's one thing in the game

00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,220
which gets really annoying this is a

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,990
game and the

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,330
in a universe where you have planets and

00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,310
you can build on the planets and minds

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,170
and chips and then you can take your

00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:57,230
fleet and attack other players and

00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,750
there's one thing you do very often you

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,120
get those planets here and they also

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:04,670
produce resources but usually you build

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,100
your fleet on your main planet so what

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,260
you do is you click on the planet page

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,780
goods reloaded you click on the fleet

00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,460
button page gets reloaded you select the

00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,030
ships you want to send and click on next

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,730
page gets reloaded you check a short

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:22,160
link for the planet and back in the days

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,590
those didn't exist it you have to type

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:30,890
the coordinates manually pain in the ass

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:33,380
and then you click again Paige gets

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,230
reloaded and you are no right I have to

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,850
choose the nation so transport select

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,160
all the resources and then I can click

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:43,220
flutter to then sending my fleet to the

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:48,110
extra planet so what about what I did

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:50,360
here I know that I cannot use the other

00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,980
script and just paste it in and it will

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,110
do the magic because there the page

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:59,450
reloads but I know that I can manipulate

00:19:54,110 --> 00:20:02,720
bookmarks if you have a bookmark and you

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:05,360
just type JavaScript and then you can

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,910
add JavaScript code there I use this

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,470
very often to prevent Google from when

00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,450
you search on Google sometimes they

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,340
notice you that they have new TOS or

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,250
something with the overlay and you have

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,920
to agree to them unless you don't want

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,960
to use Google anymore and I have the

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,730
bookmark which actually removes the

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,980
entire div and I can just continue

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,410
search without ever agreeing so the new

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,960
terms of service which is very nice I

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:33,170
think I'm on the TOS from melon or four

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,910
years ago and I did the same here so I

00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,340
have three bookmarks the first is fleet

00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:40,310
one fleet one just selects all my

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,590
transport ships and clicks Next and it

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,780
doesn't actually just click Next there

00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:47,060
is a function they expose the globe

00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:49,190
scope because the game is mostly written

00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,990
in PHP but they have some JavaScript

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,280
functions there to help them make it a

00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,080
little bit more dynamic like to the

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,610
accounts and stuff and they also have to

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,160
try submit function the global scope

00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,320
which is used on the fleets screen to

00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,370
actually

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:05,740
try to submit their javascript form and

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:08,230
you can use that so I just click send

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,180
all and then call the function try

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,700
separate and that work I'm on the next

00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,950
screen next step is the fleet to

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,060
bookmark and can you read through that

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,050
Yeah right

00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:24,040
so I select the span from the planets

00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:25,870
with the anchor and then click it which

00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:31,900
actually does this little short thing

00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:35,800
here then the selection pops out and I

00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:37,630
select after that the ul initialized L

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,850
II which is the first element of the

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:43,870
list you have to do the inspecting for

00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:46,510
that and then again try the try sublet

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:50,140
button and it works and then for the

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:52,360
last screen I do the set selected

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,780
function this is another public function

00:21:52,360 --> 00:22:00,430
for the mission select then the next

00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:05,500
thing is the update mission one thing

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:08,770
the first first part in here the set

00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,350
selected just renders around an orange

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:14,200
box around the transport and the next

00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,910
one actually clicks it and then usually

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,080
when you click it this opens and you can

00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,570
fill the bellies and there's buttons

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,910
here for automatically setting all the

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:25,240
resources and if you're very good at

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:26,560
looking you can see the change oh and if

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,440
I'm good at clicking you can actually

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,880
see the change you see the numbers get

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,890
filled in and my fleet is underway

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,290
usually if you do all this process by

00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:37,690
hand it takes up to five minutes sending

00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,010
all your ships from all your sub planets

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,500
to your main planet and you can have up

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,940
to twelve planets so it will take up a

00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,380
significant amount of time while you

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,990
play and I don't want to wait especially

00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,880
if I get attacked to get attacked I want

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:51,400
to save all my fleets immediately and

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,980
what I just do is I select the planet

00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:57,730
and then I just click fleet one fleet

00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:01,600
two three three and select plate three

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:03,100
and select the next planet and why

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,500
should you do that why should you heck

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:10,150
the games because you learn a lot on how

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:12,220
other other game developers or

00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,999
developers in general solve their

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,069
problems how

00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:17,139
try to prevent cheating and there's a

00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:18,879
nice example in drips that that's

00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:23,589
another Idol game the last one I show

00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:26,349
you today any one of you writes Java you

00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:28,869
will like that maybe a lot so this is a

00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:31,839
memory leak Idol game now you create new

00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:33,189
objects to leak memory and once you have

00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,649
leaked enough you can drop the memory

00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:39,219
and there's actually multiplayer

00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:41,109
involved where people are compared to

00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:43,959
each other depending on how much memory

00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:45,399
they have leaked and what the game

00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:48,549
actually supports I don't know if we

00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:51,129
will be able to see this is that you can

00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:53,139
connect a virtual machine to that game

00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:57,159
which does all the heavy lifting for you

00:23:53,139 --> 00:24:01,089
like clicking and stuff so quickly try

00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:08,259
to do the little heck with a click event

00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:10,149
button at memory console and again what

00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:17,949
was it

00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:26,499
bitten at something BTN - admin button -

00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:29,709
add you here yes can I click you as a

00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:34,599
perk is there another thing in there

00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:39,249
No Oh doesn't work anymore I used to

00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:41,199
work that's it okay you could now

00:24:39,249 --> 00:24:42,759
technically inspector JavaScript and

00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:46,449
find the button there's also a Chrome

00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:49,359
extension which cheats for you it

00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:52,329
because you can also buy the upgrades

00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:54,099
here for the cursors and everything

00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:55,959
which clicks automatically and there's

00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:57,909
like the perfect path you can go

00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:59,799
depending on when do you spend your

00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:02,469
memory on upgrades and when you just

00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:04,389
drip it and everything and this thing

00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:06,249
does everything for you and if you are

00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:09,369
too crazy about the sheeting and I think

00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:11,229
I had like 25 set intervals running on

00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:13,929
the click button sometime and then

00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:15,639
suddenly the page showed me hey it looks

00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,219
like you're cheating please reload the

00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:20,799
page once you reload the page you're

00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:24,669
back to the beginning and have to click

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:26,440
again yeah so I think this was

00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:28,179
everything I wanted to show you

00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,159
and I want to encourage you to hack the

00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:34,539
games police is not here yet that's very

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,690
good so we have time for questions thank

00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:36,690
you

00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:45,940
this ability to set the coordinates

00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:47,880
where you have to click or different

00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,740
technically you could read the

00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,900
coordinates from the page and then just

00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,720
menu it trigger a click event there

00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:58,630
which is not that easy because to

00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,080
actually trigger manually manual click

00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:05,350
events you have to dispatch them to a

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,510
element and then the element itself is

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,870
clicked not just a spot in the element

00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:14,140
so it is quite tricky without extensions

00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,700
to click in flash games but there is a

00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,650
thing called the cheat engine you have

00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,690
to deactivate your antivirus software

00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,500
for that because of kind of acts like a

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,270
Trojan horse

00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,890
and this lets you reach memory from

00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:29,050
tasks used from processes you select and

00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,170
what you do is you go on the game you

00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:33,850
take a number for example your gold and

00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,230
you put that number like you have 500

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,240
gold you put that into the cheat engine

00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:39,250
and then it lists you all the

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,810
information cut where the number 500 us

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,840
and you go back in the game again and

00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:46,450
spend some of your gold and then you put

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,220
that number you have left like 250 back

00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,160
in the memory and then you get a

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,290
filtered list from your previous memory

00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,150
addresses and the next memory addresses

00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:57,220
and then you compare those and then you

00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,510
find a memory entry where the gold is

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,730
actually stored and then you can

00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,940
manipulate it and go back in the game

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:07,990
and well last see that there's the

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:09,880
different amount but in flash games like

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:13,990
I said it's much mahalo and usually they

00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,480
have something like cached game stats

00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,880
which they compare on each tick to see

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,210
if the user is cheating because you can

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,460
easily calculate how many gold you can

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,800
get per tick or something like that and

00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,230
but it works for most of the games on

00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,620
Kongregate and armor games and stuff

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,620
like that

00:28:45,820 --> 00:29:09,170
I was thinking about how to find the

00:28:50,570 --> 00:29:11,210
velvet ice and constantly yeah it

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,220
depends again if it is single-player

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,590
multiplayer if it does multiplayer you

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,060
have to do some serious stuff to prevent

00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,940
this and there is back-end checks of

00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:22,070
course to do that you can also do like

00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,900
hashes of your game stats which you

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:26,240
store somewhere deep in your game and

00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,880
then compare those for single-player

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,410
games I wouldn't really care if you

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,660
really want to care there's multiple

00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:34,670
ways you can use the local storage you

00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:37,250
can if you run on the in Chrome they

00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:40,100
have an open database where you can have

00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,560
a little SQL database but the problem

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,480
the browser is that the user always has

00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,730
access to everything you cannot hide

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,970
something from the user only in the

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,970
browser

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,400
right and that's something you don't

00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:04,230
want to you don't want to use us to have

00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,000
kind of experience reloading the page

00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:10,710
every time you click like in the old

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,660
game yeah but still they take time and

00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,660
in those idle games usually very fast

00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,500
yeah

00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:24,690
and then you risk getting a decent and

00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,130
you have two states one of the front end

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,780
a different from the back end and that

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:30,330
kind of feels like cheating to the back

00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:32,940
end because the user was too fast and

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:35,160
have to be very careful with that to not

00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,230
ruin the user experience because and

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,419
when when your website breaks people

00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,490
usually reload the page if you game

00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:54,929
breaks people usually throw it away and

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:57,419
take the next game yeah sure feel free

00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:59,790
to talk to me and add me on Twitter if

00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:02,640
you want to know more about that stuff

00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:04,640

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:10,530
and you can see the name

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:14,850
