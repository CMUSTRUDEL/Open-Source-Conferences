Did you ever want to achieve super simple test cycles, deployments and serving for front- and backend projects? In this talk I'm gonna show you how this can work with tools like Docker, a CI Server and Kubernetes - and how this works out in a production/staging environment integration.

Experiences, tips, ideas, discussion. Hopefully, we can share a bit of knowledge of everyone!
