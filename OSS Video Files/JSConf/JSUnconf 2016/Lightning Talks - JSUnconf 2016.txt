	00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,490
good afternoon everybody

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,439
so this is nothing new we all have

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,170
encountered this some point in our

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,939
JavaScript coding so let me shed some

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,710
quick light on a good bad at the tricky

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,919
parts it's more to do with the tricky

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,910
parts don't go with the description

00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:33,239
Brendan Eich thanks for giving us

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,550
JavaScript and from annoying pop-ups the

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,030
JavaScript has evolved come along a long

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,739
way all these two tickets it's easy to

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,769
understand so anybody new to programming

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,640
JavaScript is appealing because it has a

00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:50,010
very broad appeal but none of us go put

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,089
our deeper dive into understanding and

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,149
that's why when we encounter we got

00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:59,339
issues we start blaming JavaScript

00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:01,350
instead let's try to understand more

00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:05,040
about it let's embrace JavaScript with

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,940
love so quickly what we learn today it's

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,250
types and questions just two seconds to

00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,979
go to this and let me know if you all

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,530
know the answers to this yes or no so

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,300
the second one is influenced by a talk

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,880
from last year's JS gone for you by

00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:24,800
Demetrius the sin of JavaScript so

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,170
trying to shed light on how it works

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,810
quick the JavaScript types seven of

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,170
these symbol is a new one newly added in

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,720
es6 the good thing is typeof null is an

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,370
object all the others type of undefined

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,810
is undefined type of boolean is boolean

00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,330
type of number is number type of string

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,670
a string type of object is object I have

00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,980
a question

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:51,630
anybody which is the seven string value

00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:55,140
that type of can return other than these

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,360
so our type of null is an object so

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,200
which means we have like seven return

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,770
values from type of which is the seventh

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,440
type of can return it's a function so

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,940
type of function is a function even

00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,739
that's not our separate type type of

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,450
function gives a function what is type

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:18,319
of array it's an object yes next type of

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,319
type of 42

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,160
it's a string why because first type of

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,260
42 is a number number is a string and

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,890
type of number that string number is a

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,450
string so answer to this is strain yes

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,210
okay so quickly undefined versus

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,800
undeclared we have a which is undefined

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,330
which means it is declared but it's not

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,050
given a value which is undefined right

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,390
next be the second one B is not declared

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,730
at all but the message JavaScript Rose

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,910
is B is not defined but actually it is

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:52,050
undeclared not undefined quick one what

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,490
is the output of this undefined yes

00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,140
because the return value is not defined

00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,140
so functions without explicit return

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,930
value returns always undefined then we

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,940
have this numbers it's not only with

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,490
JavaScript it's with any language which

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,180
adopts the I Triple E 754 specification

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:14,970
quick one one of these is true

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:17,010
which one one is false one is true the

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,520
second one is true the first one is

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,800
false because it's because of the binary

00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,800
floating-point calculation the first one

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,600
0.1 it's hard to we don't have a finite

00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,940
representation of binary in

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,730
floating-point whereas it's easier

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,380
whichever fraction is approximately

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,900
power of two it's easier to represent

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,790
them in binary in finite floating space

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,600
so that is my second one is true now the

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,459
first one next what is nan nan means I

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,800
try to perform a mathematical operation

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,739
but failed and here is the failed number

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,540
result instead and nan is the only value

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,870
in JavaScript which isn't equal to

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,670
itself okay some more numbers in

00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,090
JavaScript we have the infinity and the

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:05,160
minus infinity as well yes what is

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:06,780
infinity divided by infinity Matz don't

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,970
blame javascript for all this this is

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,459
because of I Triple E 754 specification

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,030
infinity divided by infinity can be

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,669
performed by max its nan not a number

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:21,390
some more numbers yes we have 0 + 0 + -

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:22,260
0 in JavaScript yes but + 0 + - 0 are

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,650
equal to each other

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,780
it's only nan which is not equal to none

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,310
yes we still need negative 0 if we sum

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,260
if you are doing some game programming

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,390
if you have two direction

00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,620
left to right center point yes we need

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,720
to know which direction we are moving

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,990
some theory go and read about it but yes

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,580
that is plus 0 and minus 0 next we all

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,990
which we all hate to avoid it's

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,430
questions right something to know before

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,630
we do questions there's something called

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,790
two string yes

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,090
sometimes you might have got a JSON

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,860
object and then we when we try say a

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,750
promise returns a JSON and then we try

00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,850
to output it sometimes we get the object

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,860
string and then we wonder why because

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,240
the object gets convert converted to its

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,940
two string and then that's why we got

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,310
the object to string here we have the

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,130
array a door to string is 1 2 3 and a

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,160
string then comes the number few things

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,960
about number two boolean yes in

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,060
JavaScript will do thing to know about

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,060
us there are like these faulty values

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:26,290
okay so these are the faulty values all

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,290
right okay just one quick

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,879
I said it right

00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:52,560
okay oh right this is gonna be really

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,630
quick I want you to stop using react Jes

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,960
and being a developer is a bit like

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,910
being a lawyer if how are we going to

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,060
get these big books if we do stuff that

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:06,090
everybody can understand if you take six

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,310
days instead of six months to get to

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,160
grips with the codebase and that means

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,889
your firm can replace you it gets even

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,960
worse with immutable state and once you

00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:20,099
have an object nothing can change it

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,110
what if if you don't have 37 different

00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:24,389
things that can randomly change state

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,910
firing events when it rains on Tuesdays

00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,820
except in Firefox your manager can

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:41,069
understand it your manager can do your

00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:44,370
job testing without a browser if not

00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:46,380
leaving a multi virtual machine selenium

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,229
test rig that takes three days to set up

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,500
and four days to run is not good if you

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:55,229
are paid by the hour and if you don't

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,120
believe me let's look at history there

00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:58,949
are four people approximately in the

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,530
worlds that can write a send mail config

00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:08,250
from scratch it looks like this these

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:10,199
people worked three days they had happy

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,680
lives they were rich and then people

00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,750
came and invented axiom and postfix and

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,340
of those four people three an hour on

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,340
employees and two homeless

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,140
pause for a moment just read the slide

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,860
is important and so to help stop this

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:34,920
phenomenon um I helped organize the

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:39,330
Hamburg react self-help group which we

00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,070
have about three sharings a month you're

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,710
all very welcome to come and join us um

00:07:41,070 --> 00:08:04,350
and let's rid the world of this horrible

00:07:43,710 --> 00:08:07,310
framework okay I just is a style crawler

00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,660
it's an automatic CSS crawler that'll

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,730
download like it'll download styles and

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,700
show you the like the main styles that a

00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,990
site uses and it takes screenshots and

00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,900
takes like the navigation in the main

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,670
like the main everything it's it's quite

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,410
easy to use the other awesome thing is

00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,960
that everybody how everybody hates on

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,910
Phantom jeaious this does not use it and

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,520
I wanted to make sure people knew about

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,980
like our about nightmare because it's

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,370
amazing I'm not affiliated with it but

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,370
it's great

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:47,340
okay so nightmare example very simply

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:51,900
like it's a lot of this head up is the

00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:55,800
same as phantom we can show the style

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:59,130
and that's going to open the page

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,010
pulling all these CSS analyze

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,300
screenshots okay good works I think

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,420
that's the first live demo I've seen

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,610
today that worked yeah so this is the

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,880
size it makes there's just pulling it in

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,740
from the site this is the main like the

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,260
CSS of the footer the header of the

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,880
background etc and then we have the main

00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,880
colors that are all based on

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:32,040
they're all off-screen yeah somebody

00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:34,170
pulls in these and it bases the colors

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:39,000
off these with a nifty little NPM

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:42,269
library and yeah that's pretty much

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,629
about it actually we're actually using

00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:47,579
it for and where I work for embedding

00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:48,930
magazines because we embed them in other

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:51,509
people's sites and so we need to know

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,370
exactly what their what their page looks

00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,899
like and so we can take that and

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,069
automatically pull in their styles to

00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:01,589
apply them to our to our embedded things

00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:02,069
and yeah it's cool check it out it's a 9

00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:04,379
p.m.

00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:06,990
also check out check out nightmare cuz

00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:09,980
it's way way way better than phantom Jas

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:20,730
and it's based on electron I believe

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:24,089
yeah okay hello my name is Michelle with

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:27,689
one L and I wanted to know why aren't

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,279
you giving talks yet it's because you

00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:31,259
have a whole bunch of excuses so we're

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,230
going to go through and knock them all

00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,569
out so you don't have any more excuse

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,660
number one you think oh I don't have

00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,459
anywhere to speak that's not true there

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,050
are tons of speaking opportunities for

00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,990
you I'm sure whatever city you live in

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,149
there's tons of meetups you can find

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,449
coding workshops where usually they have

00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:53,879
beginners and that's a really good low

00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:55,470
low pressure place to get started you

00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,540
can go to conferences you can go to

00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,430
unconferences and there's a range of

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,680
lengths from lightning talks to 20

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,350
minutes 30 minutes hour long there's

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,759
something for everybody

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,279
maybe you think oh people are gonna

00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,680
judge me

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,540
no actually brains are really forgiving

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,899
of speak people make mistakes all the

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:18,120
time when you're talking and our brains

00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:20,459
just correct them and additionally

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,890
people don't care as much as you think

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,930
they care you're

00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,310
it's true you're judging yourself a lot

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,760
more harshly than everyone else is

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:32,220
judging you maybe you think oh people

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,370
are just natural born speakers speaking

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,860
well just comes naturally to some people

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:41,640
false it's just like any other skill you

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,410
practice it may be some people have some

00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,000
more natural talent than others it

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,580
doesn't matter anybody can practice and

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,770
get better when I first started giving

00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,900
talks I actually practiced my talk at

00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,280
home to myself in the shower and then in

00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,810
front of the mirror so I could see what

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,440
I looked like and what weird things I do

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,120
with my hands you just practice maybe

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,790
you think oh I'm not an expert in

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,390
anything I can't give a talk that's not

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:09,350
true you are qualified to give a talk on

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:11,580
many topics right now exactly as you are

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,770
additionally even if you are an expert

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,720
in something a talk is really not the

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,250
best format to showcase that you

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,350
probably want to do some kind of longer

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:23,610
in-depth article or book or something

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,570
maybe you think you have to be a people

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,610
person to be a good speaker guess what

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,450
introverts can make great speakers

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,220
additionally it makes it really easy

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,870
when you go to a conference or any kind

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,610
of social event if you're not really

00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,410
great at going up to people and starting

00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,360
conversations yourself if you give a

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,130
talk it gives people a reason to come

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,150
over to you and then if you're tired of

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:49,200
interacting you just go hide it's fine

00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:51,630
maybe you're too scared guess what there

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,630
are two types of speakers those that are

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,850
nervous and those that are liars

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:59,760
said by Mark Twain if you can

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:03,210
comfortably hold a conversation you can

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,430
give a talk furthermore the body's

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,130
reaction to fear and excitement is the

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:11,250
same so it becomes a mental decision am

00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:14,550
i afraid or am i excited it's just in

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,620
your head okay now we're past all that

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,510
maybe you think oh I don't have anything

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,420
to talk about

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:23,730
well the average person says 15,000

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,850
words a day you have something to talk

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,770
about I'll give you some ideas maybe you

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,510
want to talk about a problem you solved

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,940
that's always interesting for people to

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:35,220
hear anything that makes you feel

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,120
feelings if you're passionate about

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,589
something

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,680
well like listening to you talk about it

00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:43,020
you can compare to unlike things that

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,210
you enjoy maybe you have a background in

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,380
something non-traditional and you can

00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,480
find a way to compare that to

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:52,140
programming for example or some specific

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,600
thing you can tell a story people read

00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:58,230
books they play games they like to hear

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,540
stories a topic that you want to learn

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,880
more about maybe you decide you want to

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,060
learn more about a topic so you can give

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,820
a talk about it and also the topic

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,230
doesn't have to be unique you can put

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,060
your own individual spin on something

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,670
okay you don't know how to write a

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,380
proposal it's just your elevator pitch

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,000
it's exactly what everybody did in the

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,540
morning here just make it really short

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,650
why do people want to listen to it maybe

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,450
you think you must have the entire

00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,060
presentation ready before submitting the

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,680
proposal no you can propose a talk

00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,060
before even thinking about how you would

00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,500
present there's always a bit of time

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,529
you'll have time to prepare from the

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,420
time it gets accepted maybe you think oh

00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:39,320
I don't know any other speaker tricks

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:42,000
guess what just fake it till you make it

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,550
let yourself make mistakes you'll get

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,800
better as you go also you can ask other

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,420
speakers for help and now you're

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,430
thinking oh it doesn't matter it would

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,020
just be a waste of time no you get to

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,300
share your knowledge gain deeper

00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,060
understanding of a topic go cool places

00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,089
meet new people get a new hobby

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,550
inspire someone challenge and surprise

00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,230
yourself and finally I want to say I

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,640
helped organize Berlin jeaious it's

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,170
every third Thursday of the month please

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,970
come speak there you can find all your

00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,750
stuff here and I will tweet this out to

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,750
you thank you

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,990
you

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,730
okay so my presentation is based on my

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,980
last nine months or so working as a

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,660
junior developer so it's basically how

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,770
to help juniors especially those who are

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,130
not coming with a computer science

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:42,910
background so first of all hire them I

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:45,880
am on so many slack channels email

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:47,790
groups Facebook groups for juniors like

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,900
juniors are awesome women in tech and

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,970
it's great when you get a story like

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,850
yeah I forgot my first junior developer

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,190
job but it is actually very rare in

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,870
these groups but before you decide to

00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,820
hire them you have to ask yourself some

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,250
questions you have to figure out am I

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:06,280
prepared to support a junior so that

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:09,130
they're successful at my company so

00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,170
first I would ask myself in your

00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,210
position in addition to having the money

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,950
to pay a junior developer do I have the

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,520
human resources and capabilities to

00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:22,690
support them so how many hours per week

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:25,270
can my team support the dream developer

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,970
am i able to actually have this

00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:30,100
structured in place an issue that I've

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,930
experienced and other junior developers

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,910
that I know have experienced is that

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:37,240
they're offered help but it's not built

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:39,430
into the bi-weekly sprints or the

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,670
workload so it ends up being you have a

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,290
question and it can be or you have

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,300
something that you to learn it'll be

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,890
addressed when there's time or when this

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,690
projects done and before the next

00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,610
project and that's not a great

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,220
environment to learn in the other

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,320
question to ask yourself is are you

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,790
willing to require teaching is part of a

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,460
developer role when you're hiring mid

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:03,550
and senior develop level developers I

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:07,690
often see ads that say like must like

00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:10,390
ping pong must be willing to go on fun

00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,830
trips I think that if you're able to put

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,170
that in a job description you should

00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:17,760
also be willing to ask for teaching as a

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:21,460
skill from your senior level developers

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,780
you should also ask yourself how do your

00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,480
current does your current team

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,070
communicate are they doing pair

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,380
programming are they doing code reviews

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,330
are they talking every morning about

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,420
things they work on if you don't already

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,680
have a culture of open communication

00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,940
it's going to be really hard for your

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,640
junior developer if you'll come

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,100
able to ask questions and ask for help

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,260
also when you're usually in a when

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,570
you're in a open communication culture

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:51,070
you usually have the language to explain

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:52,660
things as much as I've I've experienced

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,460
also senior developers who have a really

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,840
good intent in teaching me at workshops

00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,790
and other things but it becomes very

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,110
clear to me when they do not have the

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,970
experience to put the training in

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:07,270
because they do not use words that I

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:09,340
understand and yes so why should you put

00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,720
all this in place like what it sounds

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,820
like a lot of work why am I gonna do

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,010
this to higher juniors well first I want

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,020
to ask do any of you have like a super

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,700
easy time filling open positions at your

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:23,350
company if you do raise your hand okay

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,810
so basically everyone won't senior

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,060
developers you know people have mastered

00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:30,850
their craft well they don't come out of

00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,920
nowhere they have to learn and lots of

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,930
times they say well you know we're just

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,580
starting we want it to be really good at

00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:39,010
first have money and then we'll hire

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,680
juniors but you're putting it off often

00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:43,030
like on teams when they say this isn't

00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,410
the ideal way that we want to build this

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,270
project but we'll just refractor it

00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:49,030
later the costs are gonna be much higher

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:51,580
if you keep putting it off the others is

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:54,100
the other benefits hiring juniors is

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,770
that if you yeah if you make your

00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,390
developers teach what they know they'll

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,160
have to do a lot of self-reflection

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,440
they'll have to think about what do i do

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,290
how do I do it and that would be really

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,440
beneficial for your work going forward

00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:09,850
the other is that I've I've met

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,820
mid-level and senior level developers

00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:16,750
who do lots of daily tasks that they

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,910
think pulls them away from work that

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,040
could make the product better so think

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:24,310
about how you can delegate these kind of

00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:27,790
more simple tasks and Delic and hire

00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:30,850
junior to do them the other is you won't

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,860
have as hard of a time thinking about

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,470
your tech stack if you're hiring a

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,810
junior and you can tell that they are

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,220
interested in learning and our have a

00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,560
way of thinking that works with your

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,760
team your tech stack will be their text

00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:48,910
deck and you won't have to worry about

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,830
that no yep so that's basically best way

00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,720
to hire held

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,679
yours is hire them and support them

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,679
thank you

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:07,630
yes oh no my voted for my talk I

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:09,160
proposed so I dig into it and force you

00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:22,510
to see it because I think this is

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:26,020
important and this wasn't the first

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:28,120
slide as I start here so commit messages

00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:32,320
please stop writing commit messages

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:34,600
please I want to give you a brief

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,520
introduction commit message formats at

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,560
the example of the angular can one

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,140
commit message format but you can apply

00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,430
all what I'm saying - any other commit

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,180
message format it doesn't really matter

00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:47,220
so yeah - TX bla bla I work at gym no

00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:52,600
please

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:54,760
yeah we have we're hiring um so this is

00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,460
the commit lock you can see it but you

00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,920
will get inside this is commitment lock

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:03,240
of a project that had been founded by 25

00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:06,040
million past year we have something like

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,720
update test and I wondering what are the

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,360
unit tests was it an a/b test

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,640
why hasn't been updated was it broken

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,170
before or is it even better now I don't

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,910
know

00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:18,070
yeah good commit review what has been

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,230
reviewed what was the outcome of the

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,120
review and why has it been reviewed I

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:25,470
don't know

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:28,600
use proper domain well it's this domain

00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:31,960
want to you do we want to use this why

00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,060
does it affect me I don't know

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,730
we have commits like change the extra

00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:40,000
the lower dimensions and I wanna - what

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:42,540
where they changed why and do we have an

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,350
extra level dimensions I don't know

00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,380
compress it hard but stay sexy

00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,620
compressed what why and is compressing

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,150
unsexy we don't know that

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,480
yeah so adding more classes you you get

00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,040
the idea and we can do better than that

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,010
like we're the angular angular commit

00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,320
message format so the idea is to have

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:05,380
this as your subject line you have a

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,400
type a scope and a subject for example a

00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:13,190
commit message like feature JSON Kampf

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:16,610
2016 set up an epic conference so we can

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:20,060
see yeah let me dig into that so the

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:22,490
type is about what am i doing I can do a

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,110
back fix I can add a new feature I can

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,470
write documentation and there are more

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:31,850
types you can read that up if you want

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:34,730
to the scope is about where I'm on doing

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:37,100
it so I can fix the image editor or the

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:40,040
profile picture okay I can update the

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,910
dogs and the readme and then we have a

00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:46,850
subject and that's about how am i doing

00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:49,760
it so basically that's your formal

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:52,160
commit message what you used to what you

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:57,560
used to write and now it is in the

00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:59,720
context of a type in the scope yeah so

00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,290
the benefits of this there are there is

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,570
more to it

00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:04,700
YUM there are guidelines about how to

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,320
write proper body to a commit message

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:13,250
and what's how to write a future where

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:15,890
you where you fix your issues or maybe

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,330
write something about how that would how

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,820
the commit has been reviewed or

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,610
something I won't go into that so the

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,950
benefits of these one line is your

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:28,400
commit logs are much more easy to browse

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:30,260
and me personally for me it helps to

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,470
write smaller commits and single purpose

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:40,810
commits and the big feature of it is

00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:40,810
it's machine readable I will go to this

00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:48,930
I think there's not readable and you can

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:53,640
see the angular for exemplary angular

00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:55,830
good luck to see examples and this is

00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,040
good for something like automatic change

00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,690
lock creation and there is a project

00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,460
named conventional change lock and

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,930
basically what it does it takes a commit

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:09,960
lock and positive and to MD file into a

00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:13,620
human readable format so I don't have to

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,570
write any commit locks changelogs myself

00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:20,100
they are just auto-generated out of my

00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:24,590
commit message looks like this so

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:27,510
basically this is just a commit like fix

00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:30,300
the commit of the type fix at the pass

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:32,910
and then the message or we have a commit

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:36,660
of the type feature with a scope cue and

00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:38,910
then the message or we have a commit

00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:44,550
message like performance at the compile

00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:46,890
and you get it so there is something

00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:51,270
like automatic version releases the

00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:54,060
project yeah our ten seconds you

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:56,190
basically can do really cool stuff you

00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,040
can automatically determine which

00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:01,350
version you need to update based on your

00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,730
commit message you there are choose that

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,250
can help you write better commit

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:08,610
messages like committed sin and it's not

00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:13,970
that hard if you just invest some time

00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:13,970
and my time is expired thank you

00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:26,029
you see what happened there I just

00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:28,580
plugged it in a network it's because I'm

00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:32,230
using a proper operating system and I'm

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,230
probably the first guy not using a mixer

00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:37,460
for everyone who is my talk des moines

00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:39,320
in this morning I have to talk about

00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,840
hacking games and I actually missed one

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,799
game by Google yeah you all know this

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,289
little page here

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,730
oh no we're offline maybe not all of you

00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:49,489
know that this actually is a game you

00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:52,669
can click it and then the still t-rex

00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:54,440
starts running and there's obstacles and

00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:56,419
you have to jump them and if you fail

00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,480
you have to try again it this actually

00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:02,629
will sound like a peep every time you

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,649
reach more than the score of 100 so what

00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:05,649
can you do here

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:15,559
Google was very clever about it actually

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,940
and if you just open the so you don't

00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,389
see any scripts in - every batch you

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:28,429
just see this data thing and that's not

00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:31,999
the right one sources that is not the

00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:35,889
right file and if you have to reload

00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:35,889
alright because sometimes it's not

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,900
what do then is alright alright it's not

00:26:49,850 --> 00:27:00,500
the game yeah

00:26:50,900 --> 00:27:02,060
and now what okay that I didn't expect

00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:07,630
but I have three minutes to fix it since

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:07,630
I have more time alright

00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:23,720
maybe they fixed it because they knew

00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,310
about me so I just explained you what's

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,040
happening here usually you have the

00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,420
index.html and you see nothing like I

00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,120
see here but actually there's only one

00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:35,000
line but and they hurt him HTML file I

00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:38,120
tried it with you had to scroll down for

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,460
like 1500 lines they were all empty and

00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,170
then the code started to appear and then

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,730
you scroll a little bit further and you

00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,050
suddenly find the update function in the

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,360
update function there's actually a

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:49,190
little check if there's a collision if

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,540
you just comment that block out you'd

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,160
have to do you don't have to do anything

00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,990
at all just keep them running all the

00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,340
way all the time and get the points and

00:27:53,990 --> 00:28:00,130
be happy and share the screenshots with

00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,130
your friends and yeah use Ubuntu

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,420
you

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:33,090
you recognize that hopefully so yes

00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:35,639
that's an Arduino basically and my dear

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:39,179
friend here has talked about how to hack

00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:41,970
the krob Dino on the Chrome browser I

00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:44,220
don't like you I will try to show you in

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:48,269
four minutes and 46 seconds how do you

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,889
hack the chrome Dino in Arduino little

00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:53,370
web browser of course because this is a

00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:55,350
J as conference after all so this is a

00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,429
project I've been working on know

00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:02,549
TweetDeck but it's called cloudy boy

00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:07,049
which is basically an older boy compiler

00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:10,320
for for for the cloud all the boy is

00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:12,990
basically an Arduino microcontroller

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,970
built with a screen a little screen and

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,039
some buttons so you can play games with

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:20,990
it and you could code your own games in

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:24,990
like C or C++ so we have this website

00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:28,260
that packs all that up into a simple web

00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:30,419
browser session and what it also has so

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,990
you might see that I have this ruff

00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:37,139
puppy maker this is my session ID which

00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:41,159
I won't be able to use because I don't

00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:47,029
see my screen here okay that might be a

00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:47,029
problem let's try it this way

00:29:50,390 --> 00:30:06,630
and let's try this okay it worked which

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:10,230
is a good thing so I'm gonna hook this

00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:13,020
up this is an electronic Legation that

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:15,300
basically only does one thing it flashes

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:19,620
your Arduino compiled code you don't you

00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:23,400
onto the Arduino this is a basic web

00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:26,510
connected stuff so I say my key code is

00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:31,680
rough papi

00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:36,030
maker hopefully this will work okay it

00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:47,510
connected let me see if I can flush this

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:47,510
stuff on the device if okay

00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:27,210
okay this demo bakes our brakes every

00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:32,310
five minutes Oh Oh Shh okay I just hack

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:34,740
it so we get the D no I think I know

00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:46,380
what the problem is let's make it a

00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:49,590
dragon yeah I like dragons better so

00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:52,290
they're just dead it did update the code

00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:55,200
for it so if you ever seen something

00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:58,970
like that the code looks like that when

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:04,200
you compile it for the Arduino so now

00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:04,970
hopefully and we'll see if I can get it

00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,050
to work

00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,050
yeah it's the USB

00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,059
on

00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,149
oh and you don't know don't see it

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:55,629
because it's not connected to the camera

00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:58,259
oh yeah so okay actually now this time

00:32:55,629 --> 00:32:58,259
is going to work

00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:08,470
twenty seconds let's see if I can make

00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:10,080
it in time things whatever flame because

00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:16,059
I still have ten seconds

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:19,870
yes save let's see if it compiles it

00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:26,320
compiled let's see if I can flash it it

00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:29,740
can flash it it downloads and you don't

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:33,090
see it why I don't see it I don't know

00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,090
why I don't see it but it's on there

00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:48,129
okay okay I want to give you a short

00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:51,820
talk about rlea a new SPI framework

00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:54,269
comparable to angular in sorts and let's

00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:57,450
start right off I hope you can see it

00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:59,769
this is the github page for irelia and

00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,409
specifically for the skeleton navigation

00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:05,049
that is a startup project that already

00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:09,819
billed us you how we hope you can see it

00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:13,480
a skeleton in different versions we for

00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:16,569
es2016 and three for typescript and you

00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:20,109
just set up to work with normal text

00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:24,099
editor asp.net 5 or with web pack

00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:26,020
included for bundling and let's jump

00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:28,629
right into the skeleton and I can show

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:32,200
you a bit how or relay is built oh

00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:33,710
really it's a modular framework that

00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,869
means it's not

00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,419
monolith but you have many small

00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:40,069
packages you can pretty much compared to

00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:44,230
the net phone book if you're familiar

00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:47,419
with it and all these packages have

00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:50,629
mostly one responsibility and they are

00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:52,550
meant for maximum reusability so you can

00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:54,379
combine different aspects of the

00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:56,089
framework to get really a full framework

00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:59,089
out of it but you don't need to use

00:34:56,089 --> 00:35:01,910
everything you can use what you want out

00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:04,339
of that framework this starter project

00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:08,720
delivers many things you'd expect from

00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:10,760
it you have a test site that has some

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,250
basic features you have guard tasks

00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,339
built into it to watch it for example

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:19,130
and that's exactly what I do know the

00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:21,920
type guard watch it starts a build

00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:25,460
process what a whole thing which is

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,930
built in the skeleton navigation and it

00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:35,119
starts a web server where you can

00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:37,849
inspect it takes a little yes and if I

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,569
go to localhost port 9000 then we see

00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:42,829
this sample application where you can

00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:57,020
take a look at the data binding engine

00:35:42,829 --> 00:36:01,069
already offers you can you can take a

00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:11,109
look at a router which also can do that

00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:14,540
infinitely in itself and ok no problem

00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:16,069
let's look here because here happens the

00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,720
magic mostly is convention over

00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:21,049
configuration which means you have a

00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:23,359
mvvm sort of pattern you have a

00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:27,410
JavaScript file which is really plain

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,880
JavaScript in year 6 and some part 7 and

00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:33,960
you have a template that is a HD

00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:37,350
file and they both repair a module and

00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,780
you have really strictly separated the

00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:42,510
market from the cold that and the logic

00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,520
that belongs to the market they are

00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:46,740
coupled by data binding and that binding

00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,620
is a really flexible way to decouple

00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:55,050
your your code because you can

00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:58,080
declaratively display all your values

00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:59,850
from a view model or you can also give

00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:09,030
values from your inputs to the view

00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:10,440
model to to do stuff with it and as long

00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:14,730
as I hoped

00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,500
okay the data binding engine the cool

00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:19,050
thing about this is it's really simple

00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,330
you don't need to know very much you

00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,310
couldn't basically take every HTML

00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:26,010
attribute that we can find anywhere in

00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:29,880
your code and if you typed up bind

00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:32,730
that's enough that takes already a semi

00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:37,590
binding it can be two-way one way or one

00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:40,320
time for inputs it's to two-way so in

00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:43,050
both values in both directions the value

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,920
can flow for every other thing it's one

00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:49,560
way because you have no input and with

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:54,870
that in mind I want to show you a really

00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:56,670
cool example to finish this off its how

00:37:54,870 --> 00:38:01,200
powerful the data binding engine really

00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:04,920
is I have another project here and it

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,740
has not only disturb bind but it also

00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,510
has another syntax because you can swap

00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:12,060
the syntax you can teach the framework

00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:14,130
to use another binding syntax to do what

00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,740
you already wanted to do and in this

00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:19,380
example here I have the angular syntax

00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:23,970
you can see that in the double brackets

00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:26,580
here below and enclose in it I also have

00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:31,560
to knock out syntax a bit older maybe

00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:44,640
some of you know it and if I go to

00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:48,180
example already have it running that's

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:52,770
this one it is past the code and it

00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:58,500
performs the data binding you don't need

00:38:52,770 --> 00:39:07,200
to believe me blindly I started another

00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:20,850
time just to show you that's really the

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:31,890
part I was visiting so that's it thank

00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:34,140
you yeah hello I'm sorry from the last

00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,210
funny you all tired but I just want to

00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,080
talk about about the game The Binding of

00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:40,320
Isaac

00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:42,330
if you it's not about that actually but

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,200
okay so if you don't know this game you

00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,170
should check it out it's really awesome

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,300
and I just spend some time like on my

00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,010
free time to kind of make you a small

00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,520
replica in JavaScript because it's

00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,980
awesome

00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,650
and so that guy called the issue like

00:39:52,980 --> 00:40:01,080
shamelessly The Binding of Isaac

00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:02,700
oh I'm I'm gonna wait anyway and so

00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,810
like you just be we canvases and images

00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:08,280
and like venue JavaScript for fun and so

00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:11,490
like he doesn't have any like procedural

00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,870
it dungeon mechanism or anything yet but

00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,400
it just I just wanted to share and uh

00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:18,630
and play around in front of people

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,290
because it's funny and so you can shoot

00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,290
right

00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,099
