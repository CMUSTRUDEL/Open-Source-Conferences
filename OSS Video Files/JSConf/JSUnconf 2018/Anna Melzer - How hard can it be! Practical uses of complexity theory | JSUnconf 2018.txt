00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:18,600
yeah hello I'm glad you're interested in

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:20,400
that weird topic my name is Anna I like

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,350
to talk about computer games

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,170
role-playing games and theoretical

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,090
computer science so just one topic was

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,400
fitting for the conference so I went

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,980
with theoretical computer science I'm

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,930
here today to talk to you about one of

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,630
my secret passions which is complexity

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,670
theory and I'm going to give you a short

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,160
introduction to computational complexity

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,200
so I'm not going to talk about time or

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,230
space complexity if you already have an

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,660
idea what this is I will use a very

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,950
made-up real-world example to help you

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,270
understand what I'm talking about

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,250
so let's go picture this for a moment

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,579
you are volunteering at an animal

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:03,899
shelter the shelter has cats dogs

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:07,020
turtles you and your weird manager the

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,049
manager is weird because she sets up

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:15,479
arbitrary rules for you and other people

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:17,640
to follow you are in charge of the

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,439
petting process over viewing the petting

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,259
process so visitors come to your shelter

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,640
and want to have pet animals and you

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,820
have to make sure they follow the

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,119
petting rules

00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:35,100
each rule is different every day so on

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:38,189
your first day the rule is the visitors

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,290
cannot pet two cats or two dogs in a row

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,320
they're not allowed to touch the turtles

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,140
just for completion but this is through

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,479
so visitors come in may go pet the

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,780
animals they come to you and say well I

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,939
pet it a cat a dog a cat and a cat and

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,860
you have to decide for example if there

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,840
was a valid petting sequence or not if

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,899
they're good visitors or bad visitors

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,070
you know stuff you have to do you're an

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,810
engineering you're just volunteering

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,750
there so after 20 visitors you think

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,530
like ah a machine could do this and so

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,430
you build one you start thinking about

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,920
the process so

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,469
the visitor comes in and wants to pet an

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,010
animal and they can either decide to pet

00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:23,569
a cat or a dog

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,359
if after petting a cat

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,769
they pet another kid there are the bad

00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:29,840
visitors and I'm not allowed to come

00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:34,459
back same with the dog petting a dog

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:38,870
after dog but they're good if they pet

00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:41,299
another animal this is a very simple

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,840
machine that can handle your daily tasks

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:49,639
to see if the visitors alternate in

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,439
petting animals this machine has a name

00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,599
in theoretical computer science at the

00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:58,760
computer science it's called finite

00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,980
state automaton so the pictures were the

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,620
hand and the animals are so-called

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,030
States the arrows between them are

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:11,120
so-called transitions between those

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:13,310
states this is a very simplified version

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,040
of what that is so if you never seen

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,780
anything like this because you don't

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,190
have a computer science education that's

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,099
basically the rough idea that you just

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,840
need to follow so you think you're good

00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,709
and you're good for a couple of days but

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,849
then your manager changes the rule and

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:34,040
they say well the visitors first must

00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:35,650
pet a specific number of cats and then

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,010
the same number of dogs

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:42,259
thank you again you sit there you want

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,909
to work but also you want to have time

00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:46,310
to pet the animals yourself so you think

00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:49,400
well maybe I can just adjust my machine

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,430
to do that work of checking the petting

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,729
sequences for me and you think about

00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,870
that so you can start work petting

00:03:55,729 --> 00:04:00,049
something if you pet a dog in the

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:04,159
beginning you're out that visitor but if

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:07,340
you pet a cat you can pet a lot of cats

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,879
and then you can switch to a dog and pet

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:14,959
a lot of dogs and if you're in the dog

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,389
stays if you cannot pet a cat again and

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,780
you think yeah that's that's nice fish I

00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:22,820
mean I know now that I can only pet care

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,270
before dogs and not alternating between

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,090
them but it's not giving me a check for

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:32,660
whether I pet the same number of animals

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,610
and you think of it and think maybe the

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,760
machine I'm using is just not powerful

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:41,690
enough to handle this constraint that

00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,910
the manager gave me so we're introducing

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,120
a new part to our machine and it's

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:50,330
called the stack the stack is really

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,700
like a stack of books you can put stuff

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:56,180
on top of it and you can put you can

00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,010
take stuff from the top that's all it

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,380
can do so you cannot grab something from

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,020
the middle or from the bottom because it

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,870
will collapse and will not work I think

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,700
okay maybe that's already enough so we

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,780
go back to our machine which is not

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:14,270
working and we introduce the stack to it

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:17,479
so whenever we pet a cat we put a cat

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:19,910
token on the stack and whenever we put a

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:25,040
dog we remove a dog a cat token from the

00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:27,410
sec so if this the cats and the dogs are

00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,300
the same number the stack will be empty

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:33,350
in the end that we're good it was a good

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,990
visit or if there is a cat left it's bad

00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,270
visitor if we want to take away a cat

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,550
and there's no cat there although we

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,530
have pet at a talk and it's also an

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,610
envelop petting sequence and the visitor

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:51,350
is a bad visitor this machine is called

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:53,750
a pushdown automaton so the push down is

00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,490
just pushing stuff on the stack and the

00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,510
stack is endless is like it's a deep

00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:01,430
cellar with no end that doesn't matter

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,470
to you how deep it is it's just you can

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:10,010
use as much assist of you want if you as

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:11,570
much of it as you want remember that

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,130
this is just a theoretical models are

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:17,300
like no computers having infinite space

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:21,229
and again you're good for a couple of

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,870
days but then there's another rule the

00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:25,760
rule change again changes again so again

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,729
we have to pet the same number of cats

00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,450
as dogs but now introducing the Turtles

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,830
we weren't allowed to touch before and

00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,660
then thinking again well how are we

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,470
going to

00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,630
this with our stick you know it's now

00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,000
not just two types of animals but three

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,700
so it just cannot take stuff from the

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,180
top and put stuff on the top we somehow

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,880
have to take into account the turtles

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,490
now so we need a new formalism a new

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:59,440
mechanism so we did just the stack and

00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:02,320
introduced the tape a tape is the number

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,630
of cells and every cell can be accessed

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,220
and modified so in the beginning we have

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:09,280
the stack and we couldn't take stuff out

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,490
of the middle we can do this now we can

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,590
read each cell we can modify itself

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:19,930
the only restriction we have now saying

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:22,620
okay the lengths of the tape is just the

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,380
number of animals petted nothing more

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,960
that's it about these are the bounds

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,950
let's see if we can work with that

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:36,670
this tape is a so-called restricted tape

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:38,650
so our our input will again be in number

00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:42,580
of family Mel's two cats two dogs two

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,640
turtles I spare you the state transition

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,830
diagram because it will get confusing

00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,860
starting with this machine but the idea

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:54,970
is the following so whenever you see a

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:57,640
cat you walk on the tape until to the

00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:00,400
right until you find a dog and then

00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,950
until you find the turtle and then you

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,020
stop again go back to the beginning of

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:10,750
the tape and look for the first kid and

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:14,620
go on so if at the end of the cat's

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,630
their only access on the tape it's a

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,669
good visit or if there are any moles

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,750
left then it's not a good visitor

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:26,020
they're out this machine is called a

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:29,020
linear restricted Turing machine a

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,510
Turing machine is a linear restricted

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,039
Turing machine is the closest we can get

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,940
to a real computer because we have some

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,320
restrictions but a lot of power already

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,229
the Turing machine is named after Alan

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,419
Turing was a British meta machine met

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,419
the message math guy

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,209
he helped solve a crack the Enigma was

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,540
treated really bad by his government

00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:59,510
unfortunately but he laid the basis for

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,880
the modern computer all this so that's

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,320
also white formal models are named after

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:10,790
him because they were basically his

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:13,970
ideas so now you'd a new rule and the

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,580
manager is not happy about the process

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,770
of retrospectively approving the padding

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,149
process she tells you know you have to

00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:23,420
check beforehand now if they're going to

00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:24,860
put nice on it but the rules simple you

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,990
know like you know what as long as they

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:31,220
stop petting after petting 2,000 animals

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:33,470
we're good you know okay weird manager

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,550
let's see yes but you know you have to

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,930
check beforehand if they're going to

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,230
stop at 2,000 animals so your day starts

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,800
like this

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:45,890
welcome to the animal shelter how are

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,070
you going to pet today the first visitor

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,829
says like I'm going to pay at 9999 cats

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,750
and one dog and you think about what you

00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:56,839
do yes that sounds about right

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,899
just petting under 2,000 animals you're

00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:04,220
good the next one comes like I'll pit

00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:06,230
twice as many pets in this step then in

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,839
the step before and I'll start with one

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,940
cat and you're already thinking about

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,640
autumn izing this but now you cannot

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,579
just check sequences of petting but you

00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,120
have to check you know descriptions of

00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:25,399
petting processes and that can can get

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:27,230
really complicated and the programs are

00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,120
not just like the the descriptions are

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,880
not limited in any way they can be

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,010
everything if you think well you have to

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,490
believe me that restrictor tape won't do

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,709
anymore

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,120
I might need more space I don't need I

00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:41,060
don't know how many space I want it

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,610
maybe it's twice as much maybe it's a

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:47,209
lot of orders of magnitude higher than

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:50,209
that so we now go to infinity and beyond

00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:52,670
and we introduce an unrestricted tape

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:55,310
and this is the point where it's really

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,950
just a mental model anymore

00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,740
again we have a tape we have

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:04,250
read/write head where we can access and

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,740
modify every cell but our tape is

00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,140
infinite has an infinite amount of sales

00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:14,750
to both sides and we can do a lot with

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:17,180
it like really a lot there's beyond that

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,120
there's basically basically just I

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:26,510
cannot solve this problem anymore

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:28,190
type of problems some fur does a now

00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,200
what's the German word it's like a big

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,750
hammer to solve your problems even if

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,020
you just have a tiny tiny nail and it's

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:38,780
called an unrestricted Turing machine

00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:41,570
the description how you access the cells

00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,430
is it's not super complicated but a bit

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,920
too much for that talk but you can ask

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,100
me about it later if you want so that

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,330
was the basic introduction of

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,170
computational complexity so let's recap

00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,530
a bit during our process at the animal

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,500
shelter

00:11:54,530 --> 00:12:00,470
I work there we build four machines in

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,960
our head mostly the first one was was

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:06,860
the finit stayed at someone won the

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,120
pushdown automaton the linear restricted

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,410
Turing machine and the unrestricted

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,780
Turing machine these types of machines

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,330
helped so-called help to solve so-called

00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,860
decision problems for languages so what

00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,260
is a decision problem in English it

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,150
would be decide whether an input is

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,360
valid against the given set of rules or

00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,710
not it's still in English but like a

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,690
little more computer science he is

00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:34,280
decide whether a word is part of a

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:36,680
language so if you if you don't have a

00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,600
formal computer science education you

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,040
might wonder like what we what do you

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,810
mean by what is the language what is the

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,780
language I mean it speak English like

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,940
French and these are languages but in

00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:50,990
computer science a language is just a

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:56,930
set of words the set can be fin it can

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:59,540
be infinite and some sets are described

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,880
by rules and some are not so some

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,680
languages would be for example every

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,360
sentence in the English language it's a

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,770
set of strings it's a set of words

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,000
others would be the set of all valid

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:16,010
phone numbers

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,870
the set of all polynomial in tin hello

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:23,960
world so you can see that some of the

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,730
sets are no they are all infinite as a

00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,680
matter of fact but just you know the set

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:31,640
with the word hello is already a

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:35,200
language in a way and these machines

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,160
help us to classify those languages

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:42,140
there are formalisms

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,520
to help us understand how you know how

00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,030
complex the language is in the

00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,130
computational sense there are some names

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:53,000
for those languages for example the

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:55,070
first type of language we we set with a

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,810
finite state automaton it's called a

00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,760
regular language so you might have heard

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,330
of regular expressions and they're like

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,760
really really deeply connected to that

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,730
the pushdown automata describe

00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,410
context-free languages most of the human

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:13,310
languages are context-free languages and

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:15,650
can be computed with those machines the

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,540
next type of languages would be context

00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,800
sensitive languages they are human

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,070
languages who fall into that category

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,050
and another one which you're probably

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:28,610
not going to touch anytime soon are

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:30,140
recursively enumerable languages there

00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,080
are a lot of other words for those

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:36,410
groups but this is these are some of

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,490
them and if you want to look close into

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:44,030
that you just google for Chomsky

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:46,040
hierarchy Noam Chomsky was or is he used

00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,980
to work as a linguist at least and he

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,450
laid the basis for a lot of formal

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,790
formal syntax and formal grammar and

00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,230
it's a really interesting read because

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,020
it was one of the first people to look

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,480
at languages in a mathematical way and

00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:03,080
they also laid the basis for this type

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,640
of theoretical computer science so now

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,320
you're wondering like why would I need

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:12,770
to know that and maybe you don't you

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,020
know if your job is just increasing

00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,130
conversion by coloring buttons that's

00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,980
totally fine and you're probably not

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,740
going to touch this part of of computer

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,329
science but it can be useful for

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,189
validation purposes

00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:28,230
as I told you like a decision problem is

00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:31,649
to see whether an input follows a

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,629
specific set of rules and phone number

00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:36,329
validation or address validation you

00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:39,449
might have touched this and now present

00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:41,910
you would like to groups of problems at

00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:43,529
this point so we have the set of valid

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:47,040
phone numbers and the valid street

00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:49,649
addresses and in this second group we

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,939
has correctly matched parentheses and

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:56,309
valid SPG so why would you check for

00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:59,129
correctly matched parentheses you

00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:01,639
probably wouldn't but if you write a

00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:03,839
text editor for programmers for example

00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:05,879
that's an interesting thing to know like

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:11,850
do you inform your user that they're

00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:14,249
missing prevent parenthesis and I told

00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:17,309
you how regular languages are deeply

00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:20,339
tied to regular expressions and for a

00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:22,739
lot of problems and sets we have regular

00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:25,939
expressions are totally fine but for the

00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:28,230
second group they're not for example

00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:29,629
because the second group the language is

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,309
in the second group are more complex

00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:33,779
than the one in the first group and they

00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:35,879
need a different type of machine a

00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,759
different type of formalism to be

00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:41,369
evaluated and checked against so you

00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,919
can't really write any regular

00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:46,049
expressions for SVG or HTML for example

00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,209
because you have the opening and closing

00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:50,819
parentheses now I know that there are

00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:53,790
people here will probably say yeah but

00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:58,199
there are regular expressions that you

00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:59,279
can use to do that and in a way that

00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:02,519
their implementations that make it

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:07,139
possible on a strictly theoretical base

00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:10,439
it's not another thing that you might

00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:11,699
leverage but that another knowledge that

00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,220
you might leverage is the so-called

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,659
expressive power

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:20,699
so all formulations or machines have a

00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:23,899
power of what they can describe and one

00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:27,329
thing this hierarchy has is that the

00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:29,760
machine in order higher can always be

00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:34,530
used to describe and solve problems that

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:37,920
are lower than it and a lot of machines

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:40,400
formalisms actually do the same so we

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,200
have many tools for one job available I

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,760
mentioned that if unit state automata

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,370
regular expressions and regular grammars

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,750
are basically the same they're not just

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,190
very very that's not just a very strong

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,070
connections they're so called Aquila

00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:59,370
equivalent so you can always transform

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,200
such an automaton into a grandma or red

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,920
X and the other way around that's the

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,300
important thing

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:08,580
so if at one point you think well array

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,740
X would not help me here it would be

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,930
very hard to write we very hard to

00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,820
maintain you can up for in other

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:19,430
implementation of the same formalism and

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:24,240
still have the same power attached to it

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:26,730
and there are other other tools that are

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,850
basically formalisms for formal language

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:35,690
just like XML schema or JSON schema or

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:38,010
tree automata that you might find useful

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:41,370
so for example you wouldn't you know

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:43,890
implement a finite state automaton by

00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,860
hand but but knowing like well JSON

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:50,430
schema is is more expressive than that

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:52,350
and I like working with JSON schema you

00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:57,680
can use JSON schema to to handle the

00:18:52,350 --> 00:19:00,000
task of the finished state automaton

00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:05,310
some people say well you should always

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,990
use the machine the most easiest the

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:13,290
easiest machine for the job but it's not

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:15,660
really worth losing sleep over how to

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,640
implement the most the best machine if

00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:21,740
your curl machine is doing the job so

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,740
you're not really using losing too much

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:27,480
performance or anything if you do it

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,710
right and another thing that's really

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,320
really helpful if you know that is

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:38,850
avoiding pork so I'll show you again the

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:41,790
rule our manager put last pairing stops

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,130
after 2000 animals and other rules now

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:48,140
you know what as long as they stop

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,140
petting at any point we're good

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,990
and remember you have to decide

00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,810
beforehand or not if they're going to

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,790
stop or not and we have the example that

00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,740
they're just going to increase the

00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,200
number of pet animals every step and

00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,330
just imagining that humans can pet for

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,800
infinite amount of time it would be

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,590
really hard to check if they were going

00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,020
to step to stop at any point or not and

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:14,520
that's what the machine says well like

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:19,320
that's not compute I can you know I can

00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:21,120
decide I can say so if the petting stops

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,920
at any point if it does but if it does

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,410
not I'm not sure because it could step

00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,320
stop in the next step or in the step

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:31,640
after that so if you're able to

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,860
correctly identify which is the problems

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,720
if they're solvable or not it can help

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,990
you avoid some work you know and then

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,550
you can just say no ie I couldn't find

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,520
an efficient algorithm or an algorithm

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:50,310
at all that solves that problem but I

00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:53,010
could those famous people in my yeah in

00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:55,320
my surroundings or in history at all so

00:20:53,010 --> 00:21:00,260
this is what's computational complexity

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:03,060
about there are different formalisms

00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:05,310
that describe different sets of

00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,180
languages and some formalisms are more

00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,580
powerful than others

00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,650
and knowing how they connect and how

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,000
they relate to each other can help you

00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,950
make your life a bit easier as a

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,390
developer so thank you very much that

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:23,640
was it

00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:23,640
[Applause]

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,420
