[Music]

00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:49,610
it's amazing how many people you get to

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,790
know over the years and this is kind of

00:00:49,610 --> 00:01:02,839
like a family reunion where you get to

00:00:52,790 --> 00:01:05,059
see everyone I didn't know that there

00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:07,850
were so many enthusiastic JavaScript

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:10,100
developers in Hamburg and this group is

00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,690
like so diverse I never imagined we had

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,890
such a passionate and terrific community

00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:26,280
that was pretty eye-opening

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:26,280

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:46,500
I like this conference a lot I was in

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,689
this conference last year and I came

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,549
this year again even it's a very good

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,369
conference that people are very friendly

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,560
it's also very interesting thanks to

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,720
everyone who participated in this

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,860
conference organizers making food

00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:22,040
amazing

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:26,209
[Music]

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,410
I like this kind of style that everyone

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:29,500
seems to like I have a voice

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,980
[Music]

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,850
love the JSON con finding organizer and

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,220
former days

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,630
I love the new venue actually I want to

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,130
keep it I don't want to go back to the

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,080
old one I think it's something very

00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,080
special in Hamburg

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,009
[Music]

00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:00,780
I am actually not a JavaScript developer

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,659
but I go to a lot of JavaScript maybe

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,720
just to where the ones know see you next

00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:05,720
