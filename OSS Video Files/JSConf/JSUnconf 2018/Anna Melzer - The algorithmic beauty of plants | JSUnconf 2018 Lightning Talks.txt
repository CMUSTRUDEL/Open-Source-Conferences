00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,940
hi it's me again

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,650
so yesterday noticed I'm into pretty

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,369
formal computer science II stuff and I

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,820
wanted to show you what you can do with

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:26,099
theoretical computer science and plants

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,160
so I'm not going to dive too deep into

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,019
it but you can describe plant growth the

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,460
way you describe human language with a

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:38,160
grammar a plant is basically just a seed

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,570
that grows and we start with the seed we

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,469
have one leaf then we have a couple of

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,510
leaves and the end we might have a tree

00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:49,920
every step of that growth is a legit

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:53,579
plant so we can describe that with so

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,210
called generative grammars generative

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,010
grammars are grass that generate

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,050
sentences or other structures that can

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,359
be interpreted into sentences or plants

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,159
if you want to google that later you

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,060
should search fall into Maya systems or

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,670
else systems how does our grammar look

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,040
like we've got one thing that's called

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,290
the axiom that's the initial word or the

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,840
seed of the plant in our case and we

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,840
have replacement rules they describe how

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,090
the plant grows this is a replacement

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,299
rule you replace every occurrence of the

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,860
symbol on the left hand side with the

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,180
symbols on the right hand side not like

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,590
it's written here but the other way

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,229
around

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,409
I'll show you so on the left side we

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,380
have rules for SLR

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,890
our first word is the s in the next

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,320
iteration we replace the s with LS then

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,720
we replace the s and the new word and

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,540
the L in the new world and so on so the

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,820
board or it gets longer every step this

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,950
is not really a word yet and that's not

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,049
a word that we can understand but we can

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,909
apply a transformation function that

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,500
translate it into something that we

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,110
understand that might be actually human

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,060
words but also can be plants so you

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,480
could write a function that draws this

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,610
word onto canvas into a frame or WebGL

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,810
so the theoretical foundation for that

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:22,299
is the same and the cool part would be

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,459
how to translate it into a tree and I

00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:26,769
want to show you one way to do it with

00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,930
canvas and so called charter graphics

00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,090
how they work if you never heard of

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,989
title graphics before just imagine a

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,239
turtle with a pen and the turtle with

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:39,010
the pen is following directions so for

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,290
example an S would mean draw straight

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,950
line and L would mean turn left and then

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:47,230
R would mean turn right so for that word

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,599
we have here first would be drawing a

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,940
straight line that we turn left draw

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,450
sight line again turn right turn right

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,500
trust right line turn left again and

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:02,140
draw a line I had started graphics and

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,980
I'll show you how this is actually used

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,799
by someone this there's a repository by

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,620
John Bravo for Lindenmayer systems in

00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,959
JavaScript that has some nice code

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,790
prints you can play around with and also

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:21,010
it's super accessible and super well

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:24,040
documented this is the first iteration

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,389
the first part of a tree the grammar is

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,739
here on the side it's not super

00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,319
important how it looks like it's a bit

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,730
complicated if you've never looked at

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,090
this before but just to show you what

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:37,480
you can do you see that shape that goes

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,900
to lines up and one to the side and from

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,730
this shape the whole tree will grow and

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,280
I'll just show you by increasing the

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,440
iterations that we're going or we can

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,459
actually draw the tree with it and

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:56,010
that's Lindenmayer systems that's a way

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,010
to describe plant growth with grammar

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,000
