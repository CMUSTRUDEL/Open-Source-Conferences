00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:14,730
hello let's break here

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,780
I think if you're investing time in an

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,699
open-source project

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,430
you shouldn't be obliged to also invest

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,100
money in showcasing it so I want to show

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,720
you some services you can use to yeah

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,429
going live to go live on a budget and

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,009
I'm also on a mission here I want you to

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:36,180
consider stop using github pages because

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,829
the feature set isn't that great and you

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,690
check in artifacts in your version

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,239
control system which is kind of strange

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,510
and there are better services out there

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,770
and in my opinion the best one is net if

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:52,260
I calm it gives you yeah a custom domain

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,559
for free or you can have a custom domain

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,120
with certificate for free you have

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,539
really good continuous deployment

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:07,890
integration even worse like Thomas 5 for

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:09,510
configuration for CDN and it's really

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,420
nice you have a preview for every

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,369
request you have you do it offers also

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,250
cloud functions and user management with

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,540
a free tier and yeah if you have a

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,780
node.js project

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,310
I recommend leech calm it's a little bit

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,040
like code pants so it has a nice

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,110
community around it and yeah I can have

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,119
a full-blown node.js application in the

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,479
browser on a glitch comm sub domain

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,619
which is really nice and yeah it also

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,409
has a editor if you have some difference

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,090
of a side project for example go I can

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,320
highly recommend our sides by this

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:51,000
company called site but to mix with the

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,770
newspaper it's great also for hosting a

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,200
static site you can have an author as

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,020
product there too and if you provided

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,130
akka fire they will start the docker

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,530
container whatever is inside and PS even

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,610
on glitch comm you can start a go server

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,550
when you define the NPM start in the

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,370
package Jason to like go whatever your

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:17,099
main go faster

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,989
so yeah if you have a open source

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,150
project shock hazard

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,010
they are great towards out there they

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,099
deserve your money and if you want to

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,500
pay you're invited to do so but if you

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,900
don't want to if you don't can I think

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,330
you don't you shouldn't be obliged to do

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,330
so yeah please

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,699
