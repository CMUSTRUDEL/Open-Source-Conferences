00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:17,400
my name is Deanna and I want to talk

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,550
today about Hell meant to tell and

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,710
whatnot but I will not tell you

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,880
something that you don't know already

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:32,820
but I just wanted to more share my story

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:35,010
because I figure maybe if I share my

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,989
story maybe I can help somebody before

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,700
they come to the point that I was so I

00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:44,309
wanted to speak mostly about health

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,570
because about two years ago I started to

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:53,239
have pain in my arm and I ignore it for

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,949
like about a year and then a year after

00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,829
suddenly like there were like days that

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,930
I have this freakin pain in my arm even

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,789
when I was in coding like over the

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,400
weekend doing other stuff and I was like

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,710
what's wrong what I guess I never even

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,710
heard from other people or even myself

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:14,220
even when I work in the industry now

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,310
almost for 10 years never read so much

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,080
about it now and I went to a doctor on a

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,600
Saturday to the emergency because it was

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,909
really terrible and then they told me I

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,869
think you have to donate is probably you

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:33,659
need to go on Monday - I know specialist

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:35,610
just to give you the accurate analysis

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,799
of that but the doctor in the emergency

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,759
room told me that then I wonder and they

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,030
told me yes

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,090
you actually have tennis elbow

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,130
I believe it's calling Yurman and then

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,630
they told me I was in a point where they

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,140
told me you need to take a break at

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,840
least for a month and do Frankham

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,009
gymnastic which is the therapy and

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:03,329
massage for the arm and I did that and I

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:05,729
remember I was very shocked because I

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,910
never thought this kind of stuff would

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,440
happen to me

00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:13,709
as well because I'm very passionate

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,010
about the stuff that I do and I do spend

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:19,050
time in the computer even outside work

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,060
experimenting with stuff so for me to

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,220
tell me for a month to sit in the

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,380
computer or even use the telephone

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,819
because they told me that as well not

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,950
only the computer but the fact that you

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,310
spend time probably in your telephone so

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,130
I pin the tendons get tired of that and

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,769
everybody's different now - every person

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,870
can happen and anyway after that

00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:43,230
happened to me I started to take care of

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:47,640
myself I got myself birdy called Mouse

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:52,709
and I started to take more breaks and

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,690
watch out in my free time not spending

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:59,310
too much time in the computer doing

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:03,510
stuff more active and it came it became

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,000
better after a year actually taking care

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:10,069
of that I stopped having the pain of my

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,620
arm but I guess when it got better I

00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:16,290
again thought okay now I'm good so it

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,109
doesn't matter I can still like push it

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,000
again and then half a year later earlier

00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:24,450
this year I started to have really

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,829
really a lot of pain now in my back so

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:32,609
then I am back to the doctor and they

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:34,440
told me out let's go onto an MRI so to

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,630
see if there's actually something

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,760
particular in there and then it turns

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,630
out that actually yes I started to

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,180
off one of my discs in my lower back now

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,280
it the gel that we have in our spine in

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,019
the lower back if somebody had ever had

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:56,160
this it starting to get out of or expand

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:58,709
it's cold and I'm really lucky the

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,380
doctor told me that it's not so much

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,389
that is going out at the moment that he

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,810
told me I don't need any medicine or

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:10,549
surgery because some people if this gel

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,989
that we have in our spine gets out

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,180
usually you might need surgery or

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:19,590
cortisone and

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,510
yeah more therapy but he just

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,100
recommended me to do more exercise and

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,100
to what more heat on me if you don't

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,620
like to do sports just go out and don't

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,470
fit too long if you go back home as well

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,530
sometimes sitting in the sofa is way too

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,410
much so I started to do that again and

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,870
taking care of myself going out trying

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,760
to take a walk in the winter I find it

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,550
always very hard in here in this country

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,949
I'm from Mexico so then every time I

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,080
have to go out I'm like please no so

00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,450
that probably why I develop the problem

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,340
during the winter and and that's it I

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,550
just wanted to share my story because

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,780
before you get into this point always

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,010
listen to the signals so that's it

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:05,040
[Applause]

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,040
