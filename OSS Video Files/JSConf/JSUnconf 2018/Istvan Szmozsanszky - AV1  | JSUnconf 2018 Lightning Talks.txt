00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:17,279
hi I'm flaky I'm I'm a missile attack

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,230
speaker and I'm JavaScript developer and

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,930
do a bunch of other stuff and do a lot

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,090
open source stuff and some of the open

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,890
source stuff on different missile in

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,859
most developments

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,960
I do not develop anything that aren't

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,780
gonna be talking about bad but I think

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,980
it's super important to talk about this

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,120
so who is Mozilla right missile is this

00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,340
cooperation that everybody knows about

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,920
their foxes and browsers maybe like

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,170
Mozilla Firefox but it's actually a

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,890
champion of the open Internet and you

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,800
know there is a thing about the Internet

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,160
80% of probably all Internet traffic is

00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,660
video and the problem with video is that

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,170
it needs a lot of data to transfer

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,290
moving pictures of kittens over if you

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:12,930
don't want to do it over compiling those

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:14,760
two gifs or gifts shoot me so Mozilla

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,369
figured that they they wanted to make

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:22,799
sure that there's image compilations

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:26,070
work out faster than usual and work with

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,659
a better compression ratio so the digit

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,600
started videos they actually started

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,939
with audio has anybody heard of opus

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,759
here there I go

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,740
yeah exactly so you probably had an mp3

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,650
player and now we are super happy

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,200
because MPV is the patient's and mp3

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,020
codecs which is an audio codec has

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,479
already expired but that wasn't the case

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,060
so you couldn't really use the mp3

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,229
encoding and decoding freely and so

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,329
missile have figured out hey we are

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,700
gonna do like an audio codec that you

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,310
can just use freely and it kind of

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,170
worked so they were like hey why don't

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,390
we just do this for video as well so

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,180
they started working on dala which is

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,670
the super amazing video technology but

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,340
they couldn't pull it off alone so what

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,380
they did is actually onboard and a bunch

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,040
of other vendors

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,770
created a vivan a v1 is actually by

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,930
alliance of open media and it's a

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,430
shortening of alliance of open media

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:29,760
video 1 and it's a open and royalty free

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:33,510
open-source codec for video and coding

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:37,110
and video transfer so the good things

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:41,220
about its royalty-free inverse you know

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,830
for hav C or h.264 or all the other

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,530
videos that are currently dominating and

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:50,370
the internet vendors have to pay like

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,739
hundreds of million dollars to be able

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,860
to use that this is completely free to

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,350
use and it actually achieves better

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,950
compression ratio that state-of-the-art

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,190
codecs can if you have been watching the

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,739
news

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,690
Apple has just announced that they're

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,310
going to be supporting HEV C which is

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:13,049
like the newest generation of video

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:17,489
encoding this AV one actually has a

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:21,600
potential to go 30% below this size of

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:23,850
the equivalent HEV C codec it has a

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,209
bunch of other things to it it also has

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,340
a bunch of drawbacks so the one of the

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,840
reasons that you have probably not heard

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,010
of it it's because it has been a

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,049
research project for a long time and

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,280
this the bit same has just finalized

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,120
that means you're going to be seeing

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,989
this pop up in browsers and other places

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,239
more and more

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,579
what are these places in the first place

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,250
Wow there's a lot that's that's a lot of

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:54,120
that's a big vendor list the big thing

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,400
about this is video and your internet to

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,620
pull this off actually you need adoption

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,989
actually a lot of the browser vendors

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,870
that you consider important including

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:07,500
Apple are onboard in this actually

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,950
Google has contributed their vp9 codec

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,350
and they merged it into the code base so

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:16,919
Google is also in there Netflix is

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:20,750
planning to push video content out as we

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:24,080
speak so you expect

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:28,160
do you have it in content providers as

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,560
well and Mozilla already has this in

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,270
Firefox nightly you can try this out

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,120
missile also built a bunch of open

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,580
source tools to work on this project and

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,190
to pull this huge project off so if you

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:46,070
want to learn more you should probably

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:48,160
figure it out and search for a b-1 and a

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,410
om thank you

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,439
[Applause]

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,439
