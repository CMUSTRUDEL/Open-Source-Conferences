00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,619
hi hello so hi I'm Ramon and I'm gonna

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,490
talk to you a little bit about something

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,840
that happens to me very often and I just

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,180
want to first a quick show of hands

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,560
anybody either got stuck while coding on

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:34,230
a problem now can all the liars put up

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,710
their hands so I'm just gonna tell you I

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,600
get stuck this is me trying to install a

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,540
ruby gem on my computer and I have no

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,640
idea why it's not installing I guess

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,350
suck a lot this is me trying to build a

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,660
Mac OS app this is how I originally

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,620
started my career and it's not just

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,660
encoding I also get stuck while blogging

00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,600
I you know sometimes it just takes a

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,370
while for inspiration to strike so I'm

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,199
just gonna tell you a short story about

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,680
getting stuck and how we can all relate

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,580
with that and do better for ourselves

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,500
it's the stories

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,710
sorry it's a drawing a hand-drawn story

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,990
but please note my drawing skills stop

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,960
developing by the time I hit seven so

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:20,369
please bear with me so these are our two

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:24,119
main characters let's call them Joanne -

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,700
and it is a lovely day the Sun is out

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,030
the birds those are birds the birds are

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,799
singing and Joe's inside they're working

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,600
on their computer and they're kind of

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,329
annoyed because they encountered a bug

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,610
and they're just like I'm like I'm least

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,829
close to fixing it and Joanne - comes in

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,130
and said hey here's an idea let's go on

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,450
a walk

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,650
those are footsteps yeah

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,630
let's go on a walk I'm sure you can

00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,150
clear head or whatever and she was like

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,300
hold on hold on I'm this close to fixing

00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:57,600
it now what happened is that many many

00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:01,140
hours later one thing I forgot to

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,360
mention ash wanted to take Joe on a walk

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,460
with their two lovely dogs right and

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,820
what happened is that many hours later

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,830
Joe was still at the computer ash was

00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,170
not feeling that wild about it and came

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,870
over and said Joe I'm very very sad I

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,310
wish we'd gone on that walk and

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,600
unfortunately the poor dogs did not get

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:25,470
walked so I'm gonna tell you right off

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,920
the bat small spoiler that was me and

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,930
this happens to me all the time and it's

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,720
it's terrible because you know I get

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,550
stressed I get annoyed and the dogs

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,970
they're so sweet peace of my parents two

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,100
dogs they didn't get walked and but what

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,440
happens is one search wise I'll just be

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,140
like you know what I'll do it let's

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,790
let's go on that walk and being a person

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,470
who has a hard time getting bugs out of

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,870
their head I'm just like thinking of a

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,940
million ways you know I with Mac OS Ives

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,010
there's lots of memory leaks going on

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,750
and you know I struggle with it and then

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,090
all of a sudden the bang that's a

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,730
lightbulb but bang it gets the idea

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,450
comes into my head I hurry home and I

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:12,900
try and what do you know I fixed it now

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:15,510
I really short hair so now that for me

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,790
was a walk and of course to everybody it

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,709
doesn't have to be a walk it can be you

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,110
know going for a cup of coffee lately

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,780
I've been calling the public pool close

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,150
to my house my best debugging tool

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,650
because it you know you just go there

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,600
for half an hour and then you just

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,430
figure stuff out it doesn't have to be

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,769
pool it can be a cup of tea it can be

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,440
chatting to a friend it can be going for

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,450
a run maybe painting a picture playing

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,709
some video games taking a nap playing

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:45,750
with puppies or traveling what is

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,130
important is I find that you step away

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,260
from your environment for a little bit

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,650
and just let let the background in your

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,180
mind just just mull things over so what

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,400
I've learned over the years is that you

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,360
know it does happen you are going to get

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,210
stuck

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,980
and I have to remember I eventually will

00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,630
fix the problem and if I don't fix the

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,050
problems I will get the help I need to

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,520
fix the problem and you know my most

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,380
important point is one below if I'm

00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,440
gonna be stuck and unproductive I might

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,830
as well enjoy that time so that's it

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,830
