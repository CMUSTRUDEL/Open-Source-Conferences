00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:20,039
the noches meetup in Hamburg and me and

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,900
my co-organizer are very passionate

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,840
about building a community around this

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,189
topic and as it happens to be the

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:35,780
community leased by the people right so

00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:40,500
our main our main problem I would say to

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:42,960
provide to the community a good time at

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,690
our meetups is to find people to who are

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,950
willing to stay here and talk to the

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,570
others and they have usually all the all

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,489
the time the same concerns about like I

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,030
don't know what I'm talking about

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:59,850
or unscared maybe somebody who me out

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:05,880
and something like that and I just want

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:08,880

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,830

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,390

00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:31,710
