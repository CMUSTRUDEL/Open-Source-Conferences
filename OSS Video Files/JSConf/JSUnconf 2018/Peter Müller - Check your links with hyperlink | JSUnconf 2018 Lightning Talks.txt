00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,980
hello everyone do you know that feeling

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,220
where you spent months handcrafting a

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,140
webpage and then you test it and then

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,140
you deploy it and as soon as somebody

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,019
visited some link is broken something is

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,519
missing I know that feeling and if you

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,390
do as well then I have a tool for you

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,560
which I built

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:36,600
it's called hyperlink so I can show you

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:39,210
how I would test my own blog here and do

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,719
it recursively I need to type in the URL

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,610
correctly this will go on and crawl my

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,950
entire website and tell me all about

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,870
whatever what errors I might have which

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,750
links might be broken which links might

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,579
be leading to permanent redirect and I

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,770
should probably update it it will check

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,250
fragment identifiers if they're correct

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,079
and everything it's outputting tap which

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,090
is supposed to be machine readable not

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,439
human readable so you can take the

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:10,490
output and pipe it into a reporter for

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,350
example tap spot and it'll tell you that

00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:17,009
you have these errors you're linking to

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,930
LinkedIn which is responding HTTP 9 9 9

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,380
this is basically because LinkedIn does

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,590
not like to be scraped I'm linking to a

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,200
meetup page which has a broken 404 and

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,420
I'm linking to something on Jenkins

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,420
which has a 403 because they don't like

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,180
to be scraped either you can run this on

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,720
local files you can run it on remote

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,090
HTTP URLs and get this output and it

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,770
fails correctly on the command line so

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,950
if you want to tie this into your CI

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,649
integration system you can do that and

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,560
it's available on NPM NPM install hyper

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,020
link and the command line help is

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,340
hopefully useful otherwise there is a

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,340
readme thank you

00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:04,340
[Applause]

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,340
