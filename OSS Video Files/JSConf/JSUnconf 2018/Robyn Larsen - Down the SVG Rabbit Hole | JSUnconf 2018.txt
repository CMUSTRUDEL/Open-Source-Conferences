00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:14,250
everyone coming out to my talk very nice

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,230
to see all of you I feel like we cut

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,750
attendance by half from the party last

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:23,220
night so you guys are all troopers so

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,529
this talk is normally called down the

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,449
SVG rabbit hole there's a lot of things

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:33,870
that we go through this is going to be

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:37,380
what we're gonna end up with this is all

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,559
inline SVG is the only piece that is

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,610
external on here is a CSS fill with a

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,230
hex code value it's one of my it's it's

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,420
one of the coolest things ever and

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,890
nobody uses it and it blows my mind that

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,559
nobody uses it

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,059
these were graphics from a project

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,160
called pro gaming League they're now

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,800
called millennial eSports they build

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,170
they service like online gaming

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,420
companies I'm not a gamer like Halo and

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,729
League of Legends and all that fun stuff

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,970
so for all the gaming nerds we built

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,770
these really fun animations for it so

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,780
I'm a former nuclear engineer turned

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,340
front-end developer I have a really

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,250
crazy story to tell you about that you

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,740
can ask me later I work on the

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,600
international growth team with a company

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,360
called Shopify we are coming to Germany

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,640
so shameless plug if any back-end devs

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,259
are looking for e-commerce stuff come

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,150
and talk to me after or one of the

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,729
recruiters Julia she's here she gave a

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,829
talk yesterday I also run a business

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,659
called zona Fitness Academy it's an

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,450
online e-learning platform for fitness

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,560
trainers I live in a tiny mountain town

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,909
in the middle of nowhere called

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,829
Revelstoke it's about an eight hour

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,579
drive from Vancouver but none of you

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,759
know where that is

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:51,240
so I just stay Vancouver it's better and

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,430
I am a Sports adrenaline junkie and this

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,990
was our pet bear that lived in our yard

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,790
for about seven days in in a tree fun

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,500
fact

00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,149
okay so today we're gonna be going I'm

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,369
just gonna start at baseline so that

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,750
everybody here kind of has an

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,610
understanding of where we're getting

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,940
started with SVG's how many of you use

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,950
SVG's in production right now how many

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,890
of you have like you feel like you

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:21,720
stand each of the attributes that are in

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:24,090
an SVG element okay so this is why we

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,410
started a baseline from there we're

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,540
gonna talk a little bit about the bones

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,430
of our SVG and just talk a little bit

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,769
about collaborating with designers so

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,360
that you can make this less painful

00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,099
because this process can be generally

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,510
quite painful for developers if they

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,950
haven't if they're not working with a

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,420
designer that really understands what

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,580
they're doing and exporting stuff from

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,470
sketch or illustrator I'm gonna talk a

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,060
little bit about my fed SVG workflow and

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,920
then we're gonna get into the guts of

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,840
the actual talk which is the super cool

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,250
SVG animations that you saw at the

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,470
beginning so when you're working with a

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,579
design team you want to make sure the at

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,840
the beginning of the project you

00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:00,630
determine what your goals are actually

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,819
gonna be so if you want stagnant or

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,470
animated SVG's because this will totally

00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,269
change your fed workflow and it'll

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,519
change the amount of time that you want

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:11,970
your designers spending in in their

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,380
sketch files so for this reason you want

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,299
to communicate really early on in the

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,180
projects what your primary goals are

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,910
gonna be so today I'm gonna talk a

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,310
little bit about exporting from sketch

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,359
just so that we have a baseline of that

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,560
so when you guys go back to your design

00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,569
team you're like hey you're doing this

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,579
wrong so you should probably do it the

00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,400
right way make my life a little bit

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,510
easier I am NOT gonna be talking about

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,459
exporting from illustrator because

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,739
there's a lot of really awesome online

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,079
tutorials and there are great resources

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,540
for that I am however gonna talk about

00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:47,040
what it looks like when a designer will

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,299
send you an SVG and sketch so I realized

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,739
this is illustrator there's a screenshot

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,680
of illustrator but I wanted to kind of

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,200
just elaborate on the point that is a

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,299
really ugly piece of code this is by

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,519
default what it looks like from your

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,099
designer it's totally unnecessary okay

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,980
all of those nested files so for every

00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,900
single layer that goes in here this is

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,280
this is exactly what the like default

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,500
exports gonna be when you come out of

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:16,289
sketch so there is this great command

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,180
line that you can put in and restart

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,639
your computer for your design team and

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,750
it will take out a large portion of

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,130
those ugly guts that you just saw you

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,900
can write that down but the slides are

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,759
tweeted out so if you want that you can

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,979
take a look at it there's a company out

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,810
of New York called thoughtbot this is

00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,310
what they use for all of it but it

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,669
essentially just creates a compact form

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:41,130
of the SVG it's a little bit nicer so

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:44,550
let's talk about exporting SVG's from

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:47,250
sketch so within sketch we have this

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,500
infinite canvas and so what happens is

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,190
the SVG element itself will have

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,009
transforms and translates attributes

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:59,370
attached to the actual SVG and so for

00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:01,169
that reason doing really advanced

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,639
effects can be difficult because you

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,930
also have to take into account the

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,760
already existing transforms and

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,190
translate so if you have this infinite

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,710
canvas and you have this like small SVG

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,800
on one specific point within that canvas

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,270
that generally is not very helpful and

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,389
so what you want to be doing is actually

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,539
creating in your own art board for the

00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:24,349
SVG itself then you're gonna take and

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,430
select the layers within the the panel

00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:28,500
from there you're gonna take and flatten

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,620
everything flattening just takes and

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,190
merges the pathways that you saw so each

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,010
of these small elements on here will

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:42,180
have specific paths or an extra element

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,979
in indented into the SVG and so what we

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,080
want to do is make sure that when we're

00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:50,070
using the fill on it that it's all

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,260
within one single element and so doing

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,520
that process takes what you saw on the

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,750
left to what you saw on the right and

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,220
that's a pretty nice piece of code to

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,340
work with it's kind of more readable

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:07,199
HTML you know I I like it it's easier

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,750
and so this SVG is literally just the

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,250
clothes

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,159
imagine that X that you have on every

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,840
single modal every single like form

00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:18,889
element whatever you want to call it

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,320
this that's like that's a really simple

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:25,260
icon it shouldn't be that complex and so

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,710
what happens is now we have one folder

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:31,440
with two elements so we have two paths

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:37,770
which are respectively each side of the

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:41,220
X so I'm gonna skip that so let's talk a

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,920
little bit about SVG's for beginners

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,460
generally this is how the the SVG's are

00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,790
defined you have something called a

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:53,010
grouping you have your IDs your strokes

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:56,840
and so for every single group orgy

00:06:53,010 --> 00:07:00,900
element within an SVG that is a folder

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,270
respective to illustrator or sketch and

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,010
so we want to remove a lot of that

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,110
nesting the other thing that you'll see

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,540
in here which is like kind of messy is

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,730
this transform and translate piece that

00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,130
I had talked about previously this is

00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,200
literally sketch taking and moving that

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,030
element where it is within the infinite

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,090
canvas on the page and we don't really

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,070
want that because that will that adds a

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,450
lot of variable or variations when we're

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,750
taking and doing a lot of these crazy

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:30,170
animations and then you have each of

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,490
your actual elements or pathways now

00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,900
these numbers and letters they all mean

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,500
something I'm totally happy to have a

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,390
discussion about what they mean but it's

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,500
kind of just how the browser will read

00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:46,830
read the elements so what we want to end

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:50,250
up with is a really succinct form of the

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,890
SVG so we have the view box which is

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,360
essentially the artboard of the element

00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,580
so wherever the element lives on that

00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,990
actual page so imagine you have a canvas

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:03,060
that's 33 by 33 and the starting point

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,540
is at 0 0 which is the top left hand

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:10,260
corner and from there it goes across the

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,660
canvas and so by definition we have a

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,220
grouping take which is the folder that

00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,800
contains everything and then we have two

00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,830
pathways so this first pathway is that

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,360
first cross of the stroke and the second

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,590
pathway is the second cross of the

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,490
stroke and that's it that's like a

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,960
simple X icon it's a little this is

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,880
literally just so that you guys have a

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,770
baseline to understand like how our

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:37,380
SVG's set up so let's talk a little bit

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,860
about SVG optimization so there's this

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,169
awesome tool called SVG oh I'm sure that

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,880
most of you use it if you're doing crazy

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,150
animations I wouldn't really recommend

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,750
it they have done a significant amount

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,220
of work I'll explain so unless you took

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,960
the time to go through all those steps

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,200
that I talked about within sketch

00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,540
SVG Oh actually will prevent you from

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,000
being able to modify the SVG in the way

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:06,450
that you need to later on so you can use

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,700
SVG oh and do these animations and

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,830
effects later on but you want to make

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,090
sure that it's within its own artboard

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,770
or within its own canvas because

00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,410
otherwise you have these transforms and

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,350
translates attributes attached to the

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,300
SVG pathways or to the SVG elements and

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,190
this will cause a discrepancy within the

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,530
animations and it will actually prevent

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,320
you from having it accessed on multiple

00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:31,020
browsers so again

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,370
beware of SVG oh it's good for like

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,870
icons and like if you're doing really

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,240
simple stuff but if you're doing more

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,990
complex animations I still to this day

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,180
will edit SVG's in sublime or like in

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,490
your text editor because otherwise

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,330
there's there's too many variations and

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:50,010
you have to start back at the beginning

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:52,530
this is another fun little snippet of

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,900
code that I love so generally as a

00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:57,120
front-end developer you'll define a lot

00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,280
of your base lines just like you would

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,260
with the image iframe and video element

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,030
you also want to add SVG to the max with

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,290
a hundred percent as your defaults and

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,940
the reason why you want to do this is

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,000
because you don't want the SVG to be

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,800
exploded outside of its parent container

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,390
this is just one of those things that I

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,460
always add to my base files okay so I'm

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,220
gonna talk a little bit about some like

00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,960
cool how to's that you can actually have

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,340
so the beautiful thing about SPG's is

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,380
you can define it once within the DOM

00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:30,330
and you can utilize it across the entire

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:32,400
project okay so imagine you have social

00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,770
icons or you have logos this is like a

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:39,240
very standard example of how you can use

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:42,600
SVG's and so we had a project not that

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,040
long ago where we had social icons

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,070
defined in the footer we had social

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,990
icons to find in our profiles and then

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,630
we had multiple versions of our logo

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,730
depending on where it was and so each of

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,890
those items are only defined once on the

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,420
page and so you have that pathway of

00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:05,370
letters and numbers that defines the

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:07,980
actual shape of the element yeah so you

00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,480
can utilize this awesome element called

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,670
you

00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,100
within your SVG where you define the

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,790
pathway once and you can target which

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:24,330
element or icons you want to utilize

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:26,370
with an ID and the use tag and so that

00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,710
allows you to define the SVG once and

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,470
use it everywhere and so what ends up

00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,990
happening is you have a really long

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:37,200
piece of text or like a really long

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,240
piece of like SVG code that will allow

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:45,360
you to take and target each of those

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:48,000
items so in this case like you can see

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,000
in the top left hand corner the little

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,920
like lightning bolt icon you can see

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,720
that it's used in like quite a few

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,380
places and so what happens is I have

00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,260
that pathway to find once and I can take

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:04,200
it target it just by calling an x-linked

00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,720
href and so that correlates to an ID

00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,930
that's attached to the pathway or the

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,560
group within the SVG and you can use

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,270
both then you can take an out of fill

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,120
color you can add like width and height

00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,510
attributes if you want the same thing

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,750
goes with how I'm utilizing all of these

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:26,610
SVG badges or like these skull badges

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,740
that you see across the entire site and

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,330
the other way to do this as Wally's with

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,750
a lot of these like social icons which

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,910
is also a pretty standard piece so I'm

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,850
gonna take and see if I can find this

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,410
lovely piece of code so I can show you a

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,620
react project that we did not too long

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,620
ago

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:03,329
okay so can you guys read that okay or

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:06,759
do you want me to increase the font size

00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:09,569
okay so in this in this file we're

00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:12,910
defining a component called social icons

00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:17,769
you can see within here we have like the

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:20,739
angellist icon we have a twitter icon

00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:23,379
with a grouping and we have a social

00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:25,299
Facebook icon durable etc etc and so

00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:28,509
these pathways are only defined once on

00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:30,069
on the actual page within the Dom and so

00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:31,179
I pulled that into the footer and I can

00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:34,540
take and Target it throughout the entire

00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:37,179
project on any given page so what

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,910
happens if I is like is I give it a

00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:42,009
width and a height of zero and it sits

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,600
it like lives on the end within the Dom

00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:49,029
but you don't actually see it unless you

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:51,879
call it with those pieces of with those

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:53,949
pieces of code using the the use element

00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,919
so I can take and target it the same way

00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:59,109
where it'd be like social - Twitter or

00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,519
social - Facebook and these are one of

00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:02,619
the ways that you can take and actually

00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,660
reduce the amount of code that you have

00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:06,009
within within the page and so that's

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:10,540
just one of the fun ways that you can

00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:12,970
utilize SVG's so let's get into the like

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:17,860
actual guts of the the talk the like fun

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:20,019
stuff I don't know about any of you I am

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,419
like a super math nerd so there are

00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:24,809
matrices in here there's cubic Bezier

00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:29,559
functions or standard deviations it's

00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:30,939
awesome so some of these filters and one

00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,350
of the cool things that you don't that

00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:34,299
you won't actually know on this this is

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,709
the exact same SVG element and the only

00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:37,480
thing that I'm plying that's different

00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,539
on here is I'm either adding a fill

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,179
color or I am not applying a fill color

00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:45,160
at all so by default SVG's are black

00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:47,289
within the within the Dom if you don't

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,029
apply a fill color of any kind you're

00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:53,039
gonna get that and so the reason why

00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:55,299
this like you can see on the top right -

00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,779
the reason why they're white is because

00:14:55,299 --> 00:15:01,689
I'm applying a white light effect to the

00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:03,489
SVG element itself and there's no 3d

00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:06,399
effects but it's literally the exact

00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:08,919
same piece of SVG code or pathway that's

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,310
defined once and then you can just take

00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:13,430
and apply these effects these ways

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,350
so if you want to jump into code pen

00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,029
there is a code pen so you can take and

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,740
play around with any of these there's

00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:21,440
two versions of each of them there's one

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,710
with G SAP that uses it and then there's

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,720
one that utilizes the inline animate if

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,480
you go some blur like all of the inline

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:35,720
SVG elements so you can use for these

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:39,500
elements so this is the baseline okay so

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,450
we have a class set we're applying an

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,940
inline style with a fill color you can

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,440
do this within the CSS as well we're

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,320
defining the view box which is really

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,970
important so on here you'll see some of

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,410
the effects that are created where the

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,089
view box needs to actually be a little

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,470
bit bigger because of the glow effects

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:56,060
that you have otherwise you'll hit the

00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,460
the corners of the box and you don't

00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,860
want that to happen and then what's

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:04,790
happening is I'm targeting that really

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:09,020
really large SVG pathway I'll show it to

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:10,850
you after if we have time so the same

00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,089
way that you would take and define your

00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:17,030
definitions within the SVG you would

00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:19,700
also take and apply the filter element

00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:22,250
within that in line so we're gonna go

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,190
into detail a little bit for this and so

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:28,130
this particular SVG doesn't have a fill

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,170
color on it okay it is by default no

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,800
fill there's no style applied to it all

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:36,830
it's just this code that's in here and

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,089
so what you can see within this is we

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,560
have a filter where we're defining the

00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:41,260
spotlight so the reason why I want to do

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,589
that is because I want to take and

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,720
utilize the user like the filter element

00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:49,910
that you need to apply to the SVG itself

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,140
so what happens in here is you take and

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:55,459
define the ID and you give it a name

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,980
with the filter effects that you can

00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:00,410
take and apply it across and so in here

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:04,579
you take a go son blur and so I'm taking

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:07,130
the original the original element and

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,620
I'm calling the result of the original

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,810
source graphic after you take and apply

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,839
this effect so I'm going to take and

00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:18,050
create a blur effect with a standard

00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:20,990
deviation of two okay from there I give

00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:23,959
it a result and call it blur one then I

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:27,049
take that initial blur one and I

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,700
put it within the the new lighting

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:30,620
effect that I want to apply as well and

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:34,730
so I'm creating a specular exponent

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:36,890
light so the specular lighting effect is

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:41,000
literally just this light that will take

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,740
and open or close as if you had a narrow

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,779
or really wide light that you want to

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,039
apply to anything across here so the

00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:47,809
same way that you would a spotlight in

00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:50,299
normal like think of it in that same

00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:53,510
context then I'm giving it a lighting

00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:56,690
color of just off-white because that's

00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:59,539
fun and then I need to tell the SVG

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,730
where in the box so imagine you have

00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:04,429
this 3d box and you have the SVG on this

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,279
one space I need to tell it where within

00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:08,720
the x y&z planes we actually want to put

00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,520
this light so I can put it really high

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,260
up I can put it right in front of it I

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,850
can put it really low and so you can

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,309
take and like imagine this 3d

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,320
dimensional box that you have and just

00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:21,320
take and apply that same filter effect

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,630
to it then what happens is I need to

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,580
take the original source graphic then I

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,020
need to take the all of the effects that

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,059
I had applied to this and I need to

00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:32,299
squash them together because otherwise

00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:34,850
you have this really blurred you have

00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:36,440
this really blurred SVG and by applying

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,299
both of those together and creating

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,919
these layers it's the same way that you

00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,470
would take and apply layers within like

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,049
Photoshop or illustrator you just take

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,659
and pile it on top of one another and so

00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:50,990
then I will take the original source

00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:54,950
graphic I put it in and then I take the

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:57,890
the result from from the specular

00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,840
lighting effect and I squish them

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,059
together there's Anna rhythmic equation

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,419
that's applied to this I'm also happy to

00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:10,640
talk about that a little bit later but

00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:13,610
for now we're gonna open up this item so

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:18,409
you guys can see it so one of the things

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:21,220
that I really like to do is remove this

00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:25,760
source graphic so that you guys can see

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:29,510
what happens so by removing the source

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,450
graphic you actually you have a much

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:36,110
more distinct piece but by adding it

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,970
back in you can see that there's like a

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,500
more defined line on here and so

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,020
the lighting effect will actually take

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:49,670
and apply it across the entire ecosystem

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:53,450
and then if you want to you can take in

00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:55,280
decrease the specular exponent you know

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,380
actually widen the light for you so as

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,290
you increase the specular exponent the

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:03,850
the more narrow the light gets and the

00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,850
difference of the fact that you'll see

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,740
[Music]

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:22,280
okay so I talked a little bit about the

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:24,890
FE exponent piece so that really big ass

00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:29,930
piece of code right there that's

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:31,550
defining the the skull it's massive it's

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,730
because of all of the points that are

00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:36,200
within the vector itself in order to be

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:40,100
able to squash this and just apply

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:45,500
everything to a single SVG that's the

00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:46,610
effect that comes from it okay so we

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,130
talked a little bit about the source

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,810
graphic now we're gonna talk a little

00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,070
bit about the glow effect so I don't

00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:56,060
know if you guys can see that it is

00:20:52,070 --> 00:21:02,510
glowing right now essentially what

00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:05,590
happens in this particular SVG is we'll

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,590
just create this a little bit bigger

00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:14,980
okay now you should be able to see it

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,980
going in and out a little bit quicker

00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:24,580
okay so this is you guys can see that

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,640
okay so this is a pretty complex example

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:31,940
what happens if I take away this

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,260
original source graphic is it just

00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,350
creates this like really blurry effect

00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,420
on it so you can see why you would want

00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:42,020
to have the two layers merge together in

00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:44,600
order to create create that actual

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:49,540
effect and so I'm just gonna go through

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,540
all of this code right now so we have a

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,110
we have an

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,850
called glow where we're defining the

00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:59,409
actual filter that we want to apply to

00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:04,130
the SVG then we are calling that same

00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:07,730
URL within the SVG parent element

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:25,789
I am also applying a color fill with

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:27,980
this like blue hex code okay so the

00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:30,019
actual element that we're creating here

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,909
is we're taking and applying that glow

00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:34,789
effect we're applying a standard

00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:40,399
deviation of 50 so that that 50 is just

00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:41,840
how far away or like how much of a how

00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:44,330
much we're actually going to be blurring

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,429
the the element itself and so the higher

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,549
that you go it's zero to a hundred that

00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:51,950
you can be using the higher you go the

00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:56,510
more blurry the image is gonna be we're

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:59,059
taking that initial result sorry I can't

00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:02,360
like see where my mouse is there we go

00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:03,950
so we're taking that initial result by

00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,440
applying that effect and we're calling

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:10,850
it spec one from there I want to take

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:13,100
and apply the animate the Elm animate

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,840
element and I want to animate the

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,000
standard deviation so I want the glow to

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,830
create this pulsing effect and so by

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,450
targeting the standard deviation I can

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,740
tell it to go from zero to fifty which

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,529
is the standard deviation that we

00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,389
defined in the original parent goes on

00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:28,850
bluer element then I'm gonna give it a

00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:30,860
duration of 0.1 seconds

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,630
and I want to repeat the count

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,809
indefinitely so that the glow starts to

00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:40,840
like create that pulse effect by going

00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:43,820
in and out now I'm gonna be taking oh

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,760
I'm gonna be taking the the values of

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:50,419
zero to 50/50 back to zero so I want

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,039
this to be a relatively smooth animation

00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:52,700
and so I want it to go up and then come

00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,080
back down

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,679
so in the same way that you would take

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,090
and define that within your CSS you can

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,909
take and define it within the element

00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,430
itself and now we have the key times and

00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:08,380
the key splines now those respect

00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:10,090
we are related to the keyframes and the

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,100
timing element that you want to be

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:15,280
applying within this CSS the key splines

00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:17,950
are the cubic Bezier function so instead

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,260
of having the cubic Bezier defined with

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,420
four different numbers you take and have

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,830
it within the matrix itself also happy

00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,960
to explain that math - a little bit

00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,790
later and then from there we want to

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,070
take and squish all of these effects

00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,540
together with the FE composit element

00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,130
itself and so you're gonna take the

00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,410
original source graphic you're gonna

00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:38,200
take the result which we had defined

00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:41,200
espect 1 and you're gonna merge them

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,110
together and from there that's how you

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,810
create these like awesome effects but

00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:49,450
again you want to be able to define that

00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:51,430
right at the beginning and so that's

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,960
kind of part of the part of the

00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,510
discussion so now we're gonna move on to

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,940
one of the other ones that I really like

00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:00,340
and so this is that same point light

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,310
you're applying but now I'm applying an

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,080
actual animate element to it and taking

00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:09,040
and moving the light across the plane

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,570
the X plane back and forth across the

00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,970
page and so one of the things that

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:16,180
you'll see within here is on the right

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:19,000
hand side the light actually goes off of

00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,610
the canvas itself so you're applying a

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,140
negative value to that whereas you want

00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,060
to be starting if you want to be

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:33,210
starting right at zero you'll see that

00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:35,740
it hits the limits of the actual box and

00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:40,900
so within here I've defined the filter

00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:48,010
of the spot light moving I will open

00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:49,630
this hopefully it works okay super so

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:54,310
again we're taking in applying the

00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:57,040
effect we're giving it an ID now what's

00:25:54,310 --> 00:26:00,400
happening in here is we were applying a

00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,050
blur effect to the to the original

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,300
source graphic itself we're calling that

00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:07,870
result by applying a standard deviation

00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:10,210
of to blur one from there we are taking

00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:14,350
and that end results and we're putting

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:15,850
it into the next filter that we want to

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,419
be creating and we're calling the

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:21,190
results of

00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:23,200
that SPECT 1 from there I'm taking and

00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,059
adding a special specular exponent so

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,919
remember in that first example that we

00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:29,259
had with the light where we had a really

00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:32,830
high or really low value of the light

00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:35,820
and so within this particular SVG the

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:38,850
light source is actually really narrow

00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:45,369
and I'm applying a lighting color of

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:48,460
just off-white okay um I'll wrap it up

00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:50,710
real quick then from there I'm taking

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,960
and defining where within this cube I

00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:57,220
actually want this light source to be

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,080
living okay from there I want to animate

00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:04,090
the point light itself so I want it to

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:06,419
be going across the X plane then from

00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:10,779
all of that I'm gonna take and merge

00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:14,320
everything together into one SVG and so

00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:16,450
this particular effect it takes the

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,759
original source graphic and it takes the

00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,440
results of the other three effects that

00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:23,999
we had applied and it merges it all into

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,999
one does that make sense

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,980
super okay so let's talk about browser

00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:39,509
support hahaha the fun part you know

00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:42,279
what I crushing all of our souls so

00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:44,649
there is this lovely lady called Sarah

00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:48,330
Dresner she says that smell is dead

00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:51,429
so smell is the EFI goes on blur the

00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:53,169
epic opposite the inline elements that

00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:54,549
you can utilize right now it still works

00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:58,389
in the browser it still works across

00:27:54,549 --> 00:28:03,539
chrome if you go to can I use it has

00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:05,950
pretty good support okay however and

00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:07,179
like a lot of the effects that I showed

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,869
you before they also have really good

00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:12,429
support but if you want to be using this

00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:14,769
across browsers there's a library called

00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:17,739
G SAP or green sock that you can utilize

00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:21,190
and you can take and apply those exact

00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:22,869
same effects using their library and

00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,179
it'll add a polyfill and you can utilize

00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:26,529
it across multiple browsers it is using

00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:29,470
Java scripts you wouldn't actually be

00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:30,909
using this with the inline

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:33,370
SVG elements that I was showing you

00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,720
earlier but again like all that's up on

00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,919
the code pen so if you guys want to play

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,580
around with it like you're more than

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,580
welcome to Oh

00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,730
for those of you that code Andrew

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,440
because I code in Ruby I found this Ruby

00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:48,130
helper a few years ago and I thought it

00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:50,740
was just epic and you can just take and

00:28:48,130 --> 00:29:03,159
call whatever the original SVG element

00:28:50,740 --> 00:29:04,450
it is and that's it thank you we got

00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:08,500
five minutes if anybody has any

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:12,730
questions guys can grill me yeah right

00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:15,490
so his question was is it better to have

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,440
the component rendered over and over and

00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:19,480
over again or is it better within like

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,909
the react or is it better to have it

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,549
defined once and just utilize the use

00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:27,220
element and so in that case that you're

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:28,870
talking about I usually will put that

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,600
component within the footer because the

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:34,720
footer is never going to disappear and

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,150
so from there I can take and call the

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,390
use element across the entire ecosystem

00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:43,510
of my react application and the icons

00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:46,150
will render the same does that answer

00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,340
your question kind of sort of we can

00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:53,289
talk more about it after if you want do

00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:54,250
I have any other questions no super see

00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:59,569
you guys later thank you

00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:59,569
