00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:14,280
all right hello everyone I'm Cassie I

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,949
work at Jimdo as a developer and today

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,250
we're going to talk about Houdini as I

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,900
realized yesterday especially is that a

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,109
lot of people don't actually know what

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,090
Houdini is and so first thing we want to

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,250
find out what it actually is and if you

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,279
google Houdini you find a lot of stuff

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,960
there's like a 3d animation software

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,149
that's used wide across the internet you

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,600
get to a sporting goods store where you

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,250
can buy running shoes and stuff you're

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:51,750
actually on the first page you find a

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:53,520
chair buy some some some company and of

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,989
course you find that guy that's really

00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:02,460
into chains called Harry Houdini who you

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:05,339
probably know was a magician and well

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,960
that's actually the best reference you

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:12,270
will get to the Houdini CSS thing that I

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,820
will be talking about because if you

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:20,759
look in the into what it actually is it

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:23,520
is an effort by the we w3c and first

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,100
explanation on the wiki page is the

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,460
objective of the CSS tag Houdini task

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,590
force CSS Houdini is jointly developed

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,380
features that explain the magic of

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:38,340
styling and layout on the web so just a

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,549
little bit general if you look a little

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,360
bit deeper you will find another

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:49,560
explanation by Mozilla which says CSS

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,320
Houdini is a w3c effort to define

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,299
lower-level CSS api's for authors to

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,600
understand recreate and extend

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:01,380
high-level CSS authoring features so

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,930
what we actually have here is something

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:08,069
where we can actually get into the inner

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,899
workings of CSS and work with that so

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,840
where is the use case for that if you

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,230
think about it if new CSS features are

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,390
coming

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,310
and you read about them you're like oh

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,319
yeah that sounds really interesting and

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,140
I really want to use that and then you

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,690
figure out what I go to can I use I look

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,220
at at what browser support my CSS

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,980
feature and I figured well

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,200
chrome is supporting it and nothing else

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:34,819
and then I wait for two years and then I

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,510
get to use actually my CSS feature so

00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:41,220
this sucks we all know this sucks so

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,980
what can we do if we have this problem

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,280
in JavaScript what we do is we pull it

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,239
in polyfill it so we figure a way out to

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,060
go with our existing technologies and go

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,200
around to stuff we don't have and build

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,660
it in some other way

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,129
the problem for CSS is if you look at

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:05,400
what X's we have in the technologies we

00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:10,920
have especially in JavaScript yes we can

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:13,200
work with the Dom obviously and we have

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,760
a little bit of access to the CSS object

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,230
model but not really nice access it's

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,299
hard to understand how to work with it

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,669
and it doesn't really support much and

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,739
all the other tasks that are happening

00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:30,750
if we are rendering stuff in the browser

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:32,639
with CSS where we parse the CSS we go

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,639
through the Cascade we go through the

00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,459
layouting we go to the paint process of

00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,709
the browser we composite all that we

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,919
have no access to there's no possibility

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:48,660
good to go into that and this is exactly

00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:51,569
where Houdini is coming in didn't - w3c

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:55,680
and pretty much all the big browser

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:57,780
vendors coming together and they try to

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:03,030
define different api's and in Houdini

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:06,180
dare api's for the paint layer of the

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,090
process of rendering CSS you can go to

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:14,180
properties and values they want to get

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:16,769
you into the actual OCS CSS object model

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,190
there's a way to access the layout

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,730
process the parser something for the

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,090
animation worklet some

00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:29,120
for funds and a bunch of other stuff

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:33,080
that's not really punched out yet and

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,300
this talk I will mainly work with the

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,550
paint API the properties and layout

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:42,070
properties and values API and the typed

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:46,730
object model and that is mainly because

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:48,710
Houdini is really new and like the

00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:52,790
support for adeney is very small as you

00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:55,430
can see here the part of the API doesn't

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,550
even have a spec the font metrics API

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:02,780
doesn't even have a spec animation

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,640
worklet it's just a proposal now it has

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,980
a first working draft and as you know

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,440
like those those kind of things tend to

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,480
change a lot and therefore you can see

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,950
not many browsers actually are

00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:18,320
implementing any of this yet but since

00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,840
chrome 65 we got a bunch of stuff that's

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,510
actually on the live chrome and that is

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,570
the paint API and the type object model

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:30,290
and as well as some other stuff that we

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:34,670
have in canary and I think that's pretty

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:49,040
nice so let's actually look into how we

00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:53,860
can use Houdini so what we actually have

00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:56,360
to use Houdini is we are using

00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,370
JavaScript to actually define what

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,790
should happen in a certain step what we

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,710
actually using here is the paint API and

00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,470
what we are doing is we are creating a

00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,720
worklet javascript worklet is something

00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,720
a little bit like a web worker but

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,510
smaller and not that heavy weight

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,060
because if you look into the into the

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,160
spec of a web worker you will read that

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,340
it's not supposed to run a lot of times

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,340
and it's very heavy and that's why

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,250
worklets were created so this stuff can

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,740
actually be used on every paint that is

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,500
happening in the browser for the thing

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,589
that you are actually styling so as you

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,559
can see

00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:43,389
it's pretty much just a Java JavaScript

00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:47,049
class that I'm creating here in this

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:49,539
JavaScript class we have a actually this

00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:55,079
this paint method that will get a

00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:58,629
context geometry and some props and

00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,459
maybe if you're familiar with canvas we

00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:04,809
will already see that it looks a little

00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:09,909
bit like that so the paint API this

00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:12,939
paint method is actually a subset of the

00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:16,569
canvas it's pretty much more or less

00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:20,439
it's the same only that it has no Dom it

00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:21,699
has no text possibility possibilities to

00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:26,759
work with text because we're only

00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:29,559
working with graphics and that thing and

00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,899
there's no possibility to access image

00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:34,929
data and stuff like that so it's just

00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:37,329
like boiled down to the essentials to

00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:41,139
work with stuff like backgrounds and

00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:44,559
borders and other similar things so what

00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:48,039
I'm actually doing here is I'm creating

00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:52,329
a paintwork plate that's just rendering

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:55,269
bars into a some some object in HTML so

00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:57,639
it's just gonna be a little bit like

00:07:55,269 --> 00:08:01,029
when you looking at audio files and

00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,279
they're dispensing bars and just some

00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:06,039
bars next to each other with you can see

00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:10,569
it's just they're getting just a random

00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:16,239
height up here should have mirrored my

00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:18,129
monitor so yeah it's just like random

00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:21,219
height every time the paint is called

00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:24,669
and then what you have to do is just you

00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:28,299
register there paint with your class and

00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:31,839
give it a name which is dancing Boris so

00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:35,259
next up what I will do is I go to the

00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,969
HTML and some it's just some small HTML

00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:41,259
file it's not really containing much

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:42,460
except for this little script file you

00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:45,070
can do it in an Excel

00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:48,510
but it's easier to do it here it's easy

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:53,200
to understand and what I do is I call

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:55,750
CSS the paint worklet and on this I add

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,120
the module worklet J's which is just my

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,700
worklet that I just showed you and

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,950
everything else I do is I add a text

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,170
area where the class are Dini and

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,370
another one which is sibling which is

00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,630
not that important yet

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:19,420
and now the CSS part is coming up and

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:24,460
all I have to do in CSS is actually sexy

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:26,260
just go to a background image or you

00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:31,860
could actually do it with a mask or with

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:35,410
a border and I had this paint method and

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:39,610
at the dancing bars name that I have

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:42,400
written in here so this this thing was

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,610
registered on the paint method and now I

00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:56,320
can call it in here in my CSS and what

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:57,490
this will turn out to is all right so

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,190
this is what actually is getting

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:03,240
rendered it's just the text area it gets

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:07,630
random bars but as you can see if I

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:10,990
change the size of my text area every

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:13,390
time a render is called it changes

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,810
because I have random random Heights for

00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:20,760
the bars and I just set the width of the

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:26,380
bars correlating to the width of my my

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:29,320
containing object so as you can see it's

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:32,920
always when I'm rendering if I go to my

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:39,190
text area and change let's say the color

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:42,400
of this of this it will not change

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:45,940
because this is not calling a paint only

00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,620
if I change something like the margin it

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,720
will actually change because the paint

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,560
is called so you can see really nicely

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,480
that it's just happening on paint and

00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,770
nowhere else so

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,200
but now this is kind of encapsulated you

00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:09,080
can't do much about it except for like

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:11,030
do some bars and if you look here the

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,250
color is hard-coded into it and I just

00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:16,700
don't want to do that so what I can

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:19,670
actually use is CSS variables or custom

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:24,260
properties and those custom properties I

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:27,500
can use in my CSS to send some data to

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:31,550
my paintwork let what I have to do for

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:47,270
that is actually I've got it here so I

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:51,980
don't have to write it I go up here so

00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:55,940
what I have to do is actually I get the

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:58,520
input properties and I return something

00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,390
some variable that I call bar color and

00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:04,510
now Houdini

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:07,070
will be smart enough to actually get

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,620
variables from the baccarat and put it

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:12,080
into props because I put it into into

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:25,180
properties and now I can actually just

00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:29,720
use it by calling props get with the

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:31,730
name of the proper I want to call so now

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,460
I'm calling bar colors another thing we

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,770
have to do so

00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:40,720
so Houdini is able to understand this is

00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:43,940
actually add a little bit of registry

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,610
register paint in here it has to be

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,230
registered on the CSS so it can be read

00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:51,950
out but the nice thing about this this

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:54,230
is actually typed so you can see the

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:57,050
name is bar color I'm defining that the

00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:02,060
sin taxes colors work which gives me

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:03,980
some nice nice possibilities and I can

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,290
actually give it an initial value that

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,750
will be taken if I don't define this

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:12,740
property on my

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:17,960
CSS so as soon as I've done that I can

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:21,320
just go in here alright so next what I

00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:25,220
will do is actually just go in here and

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:38,540
define this color that I defined which

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:43,010
is part color and give it some some

00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:45,200
color and this should already change the

00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,360
color of the thing yes as you can see

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,900
it's now tomato and what you can do with

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,450
this is actually you can do whatever you

00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:57,140
normally do with your CSS and so you can

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,390
actually animate that thing so if I add

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:11,450
this keyframe animation which just

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:13,610
rotates the bar color and so if I had

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:17,450
this color rotation animation I give it

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:20,240
two seconds of animation I give it some

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:25,670
steps so it doesn't like go crazy on me

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:30,610
because it's going to often and I run it

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:33,470
all the time you would see that actually

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:37,420
nothing happens what did I do wrong

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,420
oh yeah I said it to you I think

00:14:41,150 --> 00:15:04,130
I don't know what oh yeah thank you

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:06,380
no anyway yes as you can see so I can

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:10,250
actually use all the capabilities of CSS

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:16,730
like animations to actually work with

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:19,310
this and make it better all right yeah

00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:23,930
so far for that so back to the

00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:26,420
presentation let's do some real magic

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,910
this was just a demo about what you

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:32,200
could do which is just make some bars

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:37,250
dance around which is not really useful

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:40,100
but what if we want to take a tomato and

00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:42,680
turn it into a badass or better said

00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,800
what if we want to make a gradient that

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,830
goes from tomato to badass and even

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,440
better what if we want to make it a

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:54,050
conical gradient and CSS has a conical

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,110
gradient feature but the conical

00:15:54,050 --> 00:16:03,830
gradient feature as you can see is not

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:05,690
supported very nicely so now you saw

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,220
Houdini is not supported that nicely

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,440
there but imagine Houdini would be

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,810
supported like fully on all browsers now

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,680
we sit here and we see our conical

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:18,320
gradients and we can't use it because

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,290
it's not supported anywhere it's behind

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:27,080
a black and chrome and nowhere else so

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:33,920
what would we do we go back to our demos

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:40,610
and here so we just created like a

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:44,510
circle in our CSS and we give it a conic

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:47,600
gradient just so you can see how it

00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:52,310
works in the real CSS I got to flag

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,690
enabled and in my Chrome Canary so it

00:16:52,310 --> 00:17:04,070
shouldn't be a problem

00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:11,090
we want to go from tomato to obviously

00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:15,020
and yeah so I'm just rendering this here

00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:20,960
in a conic class and if I go to my

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:23,840
browser we can see yeah there we have it

00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,360
that's the standard CSS way that we

00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,760
would go but as you saw it's not

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:35,960
supported anywhere so next up we want to

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:41,120
go for for the Houdini way and the

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:44,780
Houdini way would be actually to go to

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:50,330
JavaScript and at a paint were clad with

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:52,430
our worklet in it and some properties

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:56,210
which will be gradient started gradient

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:58,940
stuff they are colors they I just

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:04,880
defaulted to white and black so we have

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:08,330
something here and yeah we just you said

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:13,280
it's a little bit complicated I stole

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:15,280
some canonical gradient stuff from the

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,170
internet and I tweaked it a little bit

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:23,020
but mainly what we are doing is we

00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:27,170
reduce our connect gradient class class

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:31,610
we get our properties into it

00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:35,180
we start our paint and then we register

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:38,810
that paint as conic gradient what's

00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:44,060
happening here is just pretty much I'm

00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:46,460
taking the colors as RGB values and I

00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,200
read them out I figure out what the

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,150
values are and I just transition them

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,830
from one to another because I didn't

00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,080
figure out a better way to do it and

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,540
it's just for the sake of like seeing

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,450
how a gradient from one value to the

00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,280
other would work I think there are

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,140
better ways are just this morning I saw

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,830
today some implementation

00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:09,740
connect gradient that is using Houdini

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,780
in some kind of way but it actually is

00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,700
broken right now so it's not working in

00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:18,140
the canary with all this stuff enabled

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,850
so I'm not sure but the link to it still

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,680
is in the presentation and you will get

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:28,280
it later

00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:30,200
so yeah I reduced it that I added the

00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,110
properties in the HTML I added my

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:43,880
worklet and now in the CSS I will just

00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:46,340
go here I will take it typing and then

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,730
you see I just added my start and stop

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:53,290
values for my gradient I have to use RGB

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:58,940
because my polyfill is not that good but

00:19:53,290 --> 00:20:02,150
in later versions you probably can put

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,790
in like the word tomato and hex code for

00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:07,790
the color and it will work and then I

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:11,870
just paint my conic gradient and as soon

00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:15,680
as I save this you would see you nothing

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:21,620
changed this is good because actually

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:24,200
now if I inspect this you will see down

00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,360
here in the developer tools that now I'm

00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,200
using background pain conic gradient

00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:33,200
instead of the old or the they actually

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:38,510
conic gradient method that would be used

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:41,570
in CSS otherwise so what we actually did

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:44,480
is we just polyfill that feature it's a

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:48,650
small subset of it and it's just like a

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:52,490
proof of concept but it's working and we

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:55,670
can use it and this is what polyfills in

00:20:52,490 --> 00:21:00,560
CSS could look like as soon as Houdini

00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:03,350
is usable across all browsers and you

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:08,720
can see it it's not too difficult it's

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:12,800
not too much code in the in the

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,640
JavaScript as you can imagine all of

00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,370
this is kind of similar to the canvas or

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,490
on a canvas experiment experiments that

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:25,059
you find a good part of them could

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:28,390
probably be usable in there and what I

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:32,140
actually saw is that there are there are

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:34,420
efforts to actually put those properties

00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,370
that I'm now defining as custom

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,790
properties and CSS actually put them

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:42,850
into the paint method so I could just

00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:44,559
put them in here but right now it's not

00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:47,919
working or at least I didn't find a way

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,350
to make it work but that's something

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,280
that could happen actually and the good

00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:57,540
thing about this is actually that if I

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,429
put the custom properties in here and

00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:04,780
[Music]

00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:19,960
duplicate that and change the properties

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:23,980
around in this context they are scoped

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,530
so you can actually make it work a lot

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,320
like in actual function only thing you

00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:31,720
have to do is not write the properties

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:38,080
that you need into your method but

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:44,049
rather next to it okay so much for the

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:47,919
demos I'm pretty much done this actually

00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:50,260
just some helpful links yes

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,290
it's very small you figure it out when

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:56,290
you get the presentation

00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:58,270
there's the CSS Houdini working group

00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,429
wiki which is really nice where they're

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,320
just showing of what they're working on

00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:03,940
there's a lot of stuff that's actually

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,370
not Specht out and they're just thinking

00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,160
about coding in there because so there's

00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,780
a lot happening and it's really

00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,820
interesting to look at there's a really

00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,860
nice article by Smashing Magazine which

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,559
is actually already 2 years old where I

00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,480
heard about it the first time we're just

00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:24,370
laying out what you could do with

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:26,080
Houdini and what it's useful for then

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,020
there is a really nice article by coda

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,920
block which shows

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,290
how to use the paint API and this page

00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,090
were actually a lot of experiments and

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:41,430
stuff are shown with Houdini and with

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:43,650
some like Houdini polyfills so you can

00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,080
use them more features than actually are

00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:49,350
supported in the browser and you can try

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,050
out what to Dean you would be helpful to

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,370
do with so I really recommend looking at

00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:56,100
all this stuff

00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:58,920
and keeping an eye on or Deenie because

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,800
it will change a lot of things it could

00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,810
become dangerous but you never know in

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,710
the internet what people use this stuff

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:10,320
for but I think it's a nice thing to be

00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:14,220
able to polyfill CSS and don't wait for
