I think we should think more outside of

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,580
the box

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,199
my name is Phillip in racing on Twitter

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,949
you found me a spikey on github you

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,369
found yes poltergeist yeah we think we

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,560
use our technologies like each day the

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:29,340
same way like totally the same way we

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,489
should reconsider basically like do it

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,250
differently let's take for example

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:38,640
we right get commit messages like each

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,579
day this could be a journal basically

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,850
how we write them right so like a blog

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,360
isn't it so wait this is actually pretty

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,870
awesome so let's say I prepared

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,719
something which I call like good luck or

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,300
good journal basically so I have

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,010
different commit messages basically the

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,370
ones which I don't want to show my blog

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,290
is basically that's - - exclude and this

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,939
is how I recognize them so you see

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,189
basically good luck has basically

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,189
already two different styles like short

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,640
here like one is the very big version

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,460
the other one is very condensed so I've

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,560
had like a little or a couple of NPM

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:26,009
scripts which basically do create like a

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,310
different were which creates a custom

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:33,320
format for get locks and I write the

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,939
this to like in index markdown file and

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,799
yeah this is basically to add a nice

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,590
seam on github and then I deploy this to

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,320
get her pages so let's create a message

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,470
so basically let's make a bookmark so

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,470
JSON Kampf is there's an awesome

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,140
conference you know and this might be

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,299
the link for the next awesome.js

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,799
uncomf-- which might mean next year so

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:01,350
let's put this like yeah right then we

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,070
credit commit or credit to commit and

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,680
then yeah we basically just run em run

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,289
build and this pushes to you well

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,880
basically this builds our spirit then it

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:21,750
pushes it to my

00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:29,630
posit re and let's see this my screen

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:32,130
okay yeah oh let's see awesome there's

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,920
already what I've created out of my

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:38,010
divots that were out of my commit

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,050
messages so how far how far is this for

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,200
me blogging I don't know but it

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,140
definitely helps me was my get work flow

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,480
since I use crazy but where I have like

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,580
a similar get alias was a different

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,890
format which I usually run against

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,290
origin/master when before I created PR

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,600
and then I commit a copy this and paste

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,050
this at my commitment whereas my PR

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,850
message since I'm usually very verbal

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,640
and microwaved messages about how to how

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:09,690
you can test it and what I changed

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,420
actually so I push this onto my PRS and

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,130
nobody a because sometimes people don't

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,170
look at your commit messages like in

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,780
detail so this helps me in my daily

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,390
workflow and I just made it up then

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,110
where I just found this out by doing

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,410
something crazy

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:28,530
so sometimes we should come out of our

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,420
silos and look at stuff which we don't

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,370
usually do or even look at our stuff

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,020
with with a different set of eyes by

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,020
thinking outside of the box thank you

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,840
[Applause]

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,840
