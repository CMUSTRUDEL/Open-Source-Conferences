# What if your brain were ~*literally*~ JavaScript

Computers and brains are often used as metaphors for one another, but how exactly does JavaScript stack up against the human mind? This talk will take three facets of human cognition: attention, knowledge representation, and language processing, and compare them to analogues in JavaScript: the event loop, the object and prototype system, and the parser.

reject thank you so much and thank you

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,400
for your patience you know everyone

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,470
loves computers right uh so again my

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,439
name is Jenna zeigen and i'll be talking

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:26,220
to you about what would happen if your

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,500
brain or literally javascript i'm going

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,689
to keep the suspense a little bit while

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,450
i introduce myself a little bit more so

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:38,309
i'm an engineering manager at digital

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:41,030
ocean and the manager of the front-end

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,610
team and you might know me as

00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:47,700
eigenvector on twitter the Zygon puns

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,449
don't really go as far here but that's

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,309
cool and if you want to follow along on

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,750
your own computers or send these slice

00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:00,359
to someone else you can find them at

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:03,030
jenna is / reject jay s alright so admit

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:07,409
the title of my talk is a little click

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,450
baby baby so our adventure today is

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,400
really going to be comparing bits of

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,409
human cognition to bits of JavaScript

00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,240
the thing is humans know a lot more

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,080
about JavaScript than we know about

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,540
human cognition that's because humans

00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,280
made JavaScript but really listen all

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,829
the stuff we know about human cognition

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,470
about how the mind works we really know

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,630
from just poking at the human mind with

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,150
experiments therefore we only really

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,250
have theories about how the human mind

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,240
works we know really nothing for

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,610
absolute certain there's also a lot of

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,100
different subcategories within cognitive

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,930
science and trying to cover all of these

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,939
things and compare them also javascript

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,149
in 30 minutes would be a little bonkers

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,790
uh but also a lot of this is irrelevant

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,439
right javascript doesn't perceive it

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,630
doesn't make judgments on its own and

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,729
it's not conscious and let's hope

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,680
javascript never becomes conscious right

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:09,569
but there were a few of these ven I saw

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,760
that had potential to compare to

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,560
JavaScript so I chose three of them and

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,340
those are what we'll be covering

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,230
day so first and perhaps most obviously

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,940
we'll talk about human language as it

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,520
compares to programming languages

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,340
secondly we'll talk about human concepts

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,170
and categories of versus javascripts

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,540
prototypes and primitives and thirdly

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:34,470
human attention versus the JavaScript

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,470
event loop so the most obvious

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,620
comparison is comparing javascript to

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,269
human language so there's a pretty

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,400
obvious difference in here right which

00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:46,650
is that javascript is a programming

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,170
language it's synthetic and human

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,870
languages are mostly natural languages

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,459
so being that javascript is a

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,640
programming language and that is it is

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,410
since synthetic it has a lot more

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,959
regulation than natural languages so for

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,470
JavaScript we have tc39 this standards

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,209
body who passed specs hold discussions

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,849
on certain things I don't really know

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:13,349
what else they do to be honest but they

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:16,500
help JavaScript stay in line and keep

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:19,109
evolving so because of that JavaScript

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,420
also evolves a lot faster than human

00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,340
languages human languages evolve but

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,620
it's it's pretty slowly it happens over

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,870
hundreds of years and the evolution is

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,150
mainly you know we bring in words from

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,980
other languages and slaying gets like

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,350
kind of more officially in language you

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,400
know that moment when on fleek is going

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:42,000
to be in the dictionary um so yeah so

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,040
this happens of like slower then how

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,450
JavaScript of JavaScript evolves like

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,630
you might have felt like a taker took a

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,970
really long time to past es6 / 2015 spec

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,209
but that was pretty short as compared to

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,880
natural languages despite all of this

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,190
change though human languages are a lot

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,340
harder to learn than programming

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,500
languages so you know to become

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,260
proficient at a human language takes

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,690
years and years and years and it gets

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,400
harder and harder as you age after a

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,930
certain point when you're really little

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,090
called the critical period when you're

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,760
kind of like meant to be learning new

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,289
languages well with programming

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,450
languages i'm willing to bet that the

00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,890
vast majority of us learned her to

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,120
program or are learning how to program

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,120
as adults

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,490
so another big difference that I see

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,139
between programming languages and

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,270
natural languages that I think is really

00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,340
cool is that programming languages

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,289
create and manipulate the programming

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,810
environment rather than just describe it

00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:43,539
so its language itself that is making

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,870
these changes to the environment it's

00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:48,249
mutating state it's making new objects

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,879
but we don't really can't really do this

00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:53,710
with natural languages I can't say we're

00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,870
not like wizard Harry Potter I can't say

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,129
Akio chocolate bar when we'll fly up to

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,580
me on stage and then I could eat it

00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:02,289
right here in front of you but I have

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,360
heard a lot of people talk about how

00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:06,340
they feel like when their programming

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,779
feels like they're doing magic that is

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:12,490
because of the ability for language to

00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:16,719
manipulate change and have an effect on

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,370
the environment but it's not all pile of

00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:19,990
differences there are some similarities

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,610
between programming languages and

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,310
natural languages because they are both

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:27,610
languages so both classes of language

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,520
have both syntax and semantics so syntax

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,870
is you know what is like what's the

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,189
right way to put words together it's

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,969
kind of what you're studying when you're

00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:39,099
studying grammar so they both have that

00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:40,779
semantics is the study of meaning so

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:44,050
either on a word level or a sentence

00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:47,439
level so you know lines of code have

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:50,289
meaning you could say that but there are

00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,419
even still more differences so natural

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:54,879
languages have their own morphology and

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,949
phonology while programming languages

00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,310
don't because these are related to the

00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:02,139
natural evolution of languages so these

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,639
languages again are evolving naturally

00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:05,349
versus the evolution of programming

00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,169
languages which is more regulated and

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,419
synthetic Tom or follow G is the study

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,879
of the building blocks of words those

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:15,699
prefixes and suffixes the Lego like

00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,250
kernels of word meaning that may or may

00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:21,399
not come from other languages such as

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:23,169
Latin or Greek and phonology is the

00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,649
study of the way that we pronounce words

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:28,539
and the way that they sound and because

00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:30,399
a lot of the words that are that are

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,050
used in programming languages come from

00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,789
English if you're going to pronounce a

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,110
word if you're gonna pronounce the line

00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,139
of code out loud it's going to sound

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,620
like you're speaking English so

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,910
programming languages especially

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,810
JavaScript don't have

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:46,660
their own phonology another similarity

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,570
is that both programming languages and

00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,640
natural languages have pragmatics which

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,760
is you know what is socially acceptable

00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,530
or idiomatic within the language these

00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,390
violations aren't necessarily

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,760
ungrammatical per se but they're just

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:03,700
not quite right in programming languages

00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:07,360
you you see this in style guides so you

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,770
know got your yes Linton JS hint and

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,170
stuff so things that come up that aren't

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:16,060
necessarily syntax errors but you might

00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:18,670
get warned of by these tools so

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,270
something that really affects semantics

00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:25,320
and pragmatics is context so human

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,030
language is highly context-sensitive

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,000
while programming languages are less so

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:33,160
so while the equus crypt spec defines a

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,690
context-free grammar for its parser it

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,180
immediately goes on to say that this

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,010
grammar is not sufficiently powerful to

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:43,720
explain if something is valid equi

00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:47,020
script however human language really

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,940
depends on context and is cannot at all

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,450
be described by a context-free grammar

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,610
and human language relies on context so

00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:57,340
much because human language is filled

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,290
with ambiguity either semantics or

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,510
syntactic but we don't really ever

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,419
notice this and that's because our

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:06,940
brains are so good at using context to

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,530
what's called resolve the ambiguities to

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,660
find the right meaning the intended

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,840
meaning for the words or the syntax

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,990
which was used so in an example of a

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,780
syntactically ambiguous sentence is I

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:22,210
saw the unicorn with the binoculars so

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,030
this can have two interpretations can

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:29,080
either be that I was using a pair of

00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:31,270
binoculars to see a unicorn or that I

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,780
see a unicorn who owns her own pair of

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,880
binoculars so well I mean I think this

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,099
is pretty cool that human language can

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,099
do this it would be really dangerous for

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:43,960
JavaScript to have syntactic or any type

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,240
of ambiguity because you're really

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,339
counting on on the consistency and the

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,410
repeatability the deterministic of a

00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:52,000
line of code especially if you're going

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,500
to like call different functions in

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,150
certain areas you kind of wanted to

00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:01,090
have the same effect whenever you call

00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:03,610
it right so yeah not so great so its

00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:06,850
context that allows human language to be

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,670
rich it allows us to do cool things with

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,650
language it allows us to make puns which

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,950
i think is the favorite type of wordplay

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:17,050
in the JavaScript community you also get

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,370
meta meaning from context so the way

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,070
that you say something affects its

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:29,070
meaning for example sarcasm we know that

00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:32,290
everybody loves sarcasm right so uh

00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,690
human language is messy and it's great

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,690
most of the time and javascript is not

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:41,260
that messy and it's also a great most of

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:44,020
the time so one thing that we really

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,570
depend on context for is what's called

00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:49,690
reference so in human languages these

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:51,640
this comes up as pronouns it's like okay

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,500
well yeah it seems like variables could

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,080
kind of be a pronoun analog in

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,589
programming languages because variables

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,450
you define a thing and then you say what

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:03,430
it refers to and then you keep using

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:06,430
that thing that you defined well with

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:09,480
pronouns they refer to something like

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:13,560
otherwise mentioned within a context and

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:16,660
in human languages there's two types of

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,839
reference one is called an afro and the

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,610
other is called Khafre so in a nephron

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,860
seeeeee the thing that you're referring

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,510
to comes up before the pronouns so you

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:30,040
see Jenna and talk before she and it in

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,260
Katara the pronouns occur before the

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,720
things that they're referring to so you

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:39,300
have she and there before Jenna and

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,040
Berlin well this is fine for humans

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,190
javascript is not super cool with this

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,960
right so much so that there's valuable

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,750
hoisting that will theoretically fix the

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,130
Katara should it occur so it's not in me

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:58,089
and the final parse product or whatever

00:10:53,130 --> 00:11:01,360
I saw another form of reference in in

00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:03,910
JavaScript that was not really just like

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,900
distinguished in human language which

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,810
was JavaScript's this

00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,520
so for JavaScript the reference is kind

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,080
of implicit you never really officially

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,760
define what this is it's just part of

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,310
the way the JavaScript works and it's

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,320
based on the context and JavaScript

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,150
always has this down even if us as

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,650
humans reading a program might not have

00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,820
it completely down you might not know

00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,840
what this is all the time if you're

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,700
reading code um and then if all else

00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,890
fails JavaScript we'll just all else

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,050
fails JavaScript will just say it's in

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:36,020
the it's refers to the global scope

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,220
imagine if someone used to pronoun and

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,570
you didn't know what it was and you just

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,860
figured it referred to the whole world

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:44,030
that would be kind of weird um um

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,610
because we don't need this default

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:50,240
because we are capable of following up

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,820
and asking what things mean so um we're

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,190
much better at error handling so that's

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:59,000
I humans don't make syntax errors like

00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:03,920
there's dangling pronouns everywhere but

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,540
um it's you know we can say oh like who

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,070
did you mean by she and then they'll be

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,100
like oh i meant Janice or you didn't

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:13,460
catch that while if this happens

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:17,150
JavaScript would just throw a syntax

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:21,290
error and it wouldn't be that great so

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:23,360
moving on um because we as humans use

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,340
language to represent things and

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,890
javascript is a language it makes sense

00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,750
that both human language and JavaScript

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,970
deal in this field of concepts and

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,890
categories this is also known as

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,550
knowledge representation and it is

00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:39,530
essential for humans abilities to parse

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,380
but then deal with the world and

00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,750
interact with things if we were to have

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,730
a unique way of dealing with every

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,580
single object in the world we would fall

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:53,480
over kind of like JavaScript does

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:55,040
encounters a syntax error so we put

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,280
things into buckets so we know how to

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,960
deal with things generally and this is

00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,090
how we effectively and efficiently deal

00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:06,890
with the world so this is this is called

00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:08,720
cognitive economy so an example of what

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:11,210
we might use concepts and categories for

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,460
is identifying that this yorkie puppy is

00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:18,140
a dog and not a cat uh you know this it

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,940
could possibly be a cat right it has

00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,820
some cat-like

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,520
features pointy ears it's very kind of

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,080
the size of cat four legs and if it

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,000
never makes a sound you don't know that

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,830
it works but we know it's dog

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,400
automatically there's no problem with

00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,020
that so for humans a lot of this

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,750
concepts and categories stuff is about

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,480
object recognition so how do we

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,270
recognize and then deal with objects but

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,300
again javascript doesn't perceive

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,160
because it's a programming language so

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,580
like I was like there's got to be

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,140
something in here like let me just keep

00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,700
looking for him right notes so as I was

00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,630
looking through my cognitive science

00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,730
notes some words kind of stood out at me

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,860
so I was looking at the categorization

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,110
theories and there's classical and

00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,580
prototype theory and then like that

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,720
looks familiar as compared to

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:12,880
inheritance architectures um it might

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,040
actually be a coincidence these the

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,410
words themselves but what is not a

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,620
coincidence is that the overall theories

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:23,080
are actually similar this the classical

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,040
theory of categorization is very similar

00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,590
to object inheritance in JavaScript and

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,110
some other programming languages this is

00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,080
because one of the authors one of the

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:38,410
the theorists for this first

00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:40,030
categorization theory uh was before he

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:44,130
was working on this cognitive science

00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:46,300
stuff he was thinking about how to

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,070
organize information within computer

00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,780
programs he realized that it was most

00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,510
economical for computers to use

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,830
well-ordered hierarchies and then he was

00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,160
like huh yeah I wonder if this applies

00:14:53,830 --> 00:15:01,570
to humans too let's run some experiments

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:04,930
so he and his partner in science came up

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:07,839
with this semantic Network bat which two

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,430
test subjects so in this you see

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,930
categories are organized in a

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,990
hierarchical structure and there's

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,640
feature inheritance so to test this they

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,620
presented subjects with yes or no

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,600
questions and then measured their

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,200
reaction time to try and model this

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,960
chart in time so they asked those

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,200
questions about the pure hierarchy such

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,910
as is a canary-bird and is a canary and

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,880
animal they also asked questions

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:38,750
about future inheritance so is a canary

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,330
yellow and does a canary breathe they

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,610
found that true to the chart it took

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,280
longer to answer questions that involve

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,830
traversing this hierarchy more so it

00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,200
took longer to answer does a canary

00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:54,830
breathe versus is a canary yellow

00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:58,880
because yellow is a property on canary

00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:01,940
for breathing is a property on animal so

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,740
for the most part the subjects had

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,320
reaction times that pretty much modeled

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,870
this chart and I'm pretty sure that if

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,820
we ran JavaScript through the experiment

00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,750
it would perform like a human because

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,430
method dispatch kind of looks like this

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,940
but there's starts to break down a

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:22,270
little bit in humans so there's things

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:26,150
called typicality effects so for example

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:29,260
sharks aren't really typical fish so you

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:35,240
know sometimes this gets a little fishy

00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:38,110
pun call back so it might take longer

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,490
for you to verify that a shark is a fish

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,830
then it would be to verify that a shark

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:47,600
is an animal this doesn't really follow

00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:48,590
that hierarchy right so theorists are

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,480
like all right well we got to reevaluate

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:54,370
this and they came up with some new

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:58,460
theories these are more about similarity

00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,960
than about hierarchy but it's okay

00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,810
because we're talking about humans and

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,900
not about programming languages and so

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:07,160
this I couldn't really find many

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,430
similarities in here between this end

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,860
and JavaScript except that it seems like

00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,720
prototype theories kind of more like

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,910
classical inheritance an exempt our

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,520
theories kind of for like prototype will

00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,830
inheritance but that's cool whatever I

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,140
did learn and I did get out of this that

00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:27,110
maybe object orientation is in fact a

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,030
good way to structure your programs but

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:33,250
I'm gonna move on before I get rotten

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:35,570
tomatoes sworn at me okay so another

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,610
subset of study within basic within

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,490
concepts and categories is this idea of

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:42,710
basic level categories so this is a

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,760
natural level of categorization it's

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,890
what we tend to use in

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,450
versation to this just right level of

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,780
specificity that is usually the

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:55,320
pragmatic choice so if we go back to our

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:57,900
trusty hierarchy chart a bird and fish

00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,120
would be the basic level categories in

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,270
here while animal is the superordinate

00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:06,180
category and canary and ostrich would be

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,610
these subordinates Atta Gauri's so i was

00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:12,300
like huh yeah I kind of see this coming

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:16,710
up in JavaScript to my human brain kind

00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,630
of thinks that like function and number

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:23,610
these are kind of basic level categories

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:25,860
in in JavaScript so I went back to the

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,630
trustee ECMO script spec and lo and

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,000
behold I found a list of things that I

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:34,830
saw ha yeah this could be javascripts

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,080
basic level categories and I ran them

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,750
through and like ok so if they're gonna

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,270
be basic level categories well first

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,730
object is totally the superordinate

00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,980
category it's the the top of the chart

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,580
so if they're going to be basically at

00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:54,360
agura's they're going to have object

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:57,570
like clothes as their prototypes so did

00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,860
this and then I did that and felt really

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,040
silly because of course this is what

00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,480
happened um but I was like there's

00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,880
something missing here right like I

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,980
thought function like my human brain was

00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,600
thinking that functions were a basic

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,820
level and what about arrays and even

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,890
date and promise um so I read the spec a

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,270
little more and found them in a list

00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,180
that also included all the

00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,340
aforementioned things the previous list

00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,080
and this list was well known intrinsic

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,750
objects so these are things that are

00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:31,920
explicitly referenced by algorithms of

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:36,420
this specification and I did more

00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:40,800
science on these and some of these make

00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:44,820
sense uh I wouldn't argue like but other

00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,250
ones so like array is in here but also

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,990
float32 array and my human brain is like

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:53,640
well for raised in there float32 array

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,960
is not a basic level but um javascript

00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,510
is a programming language doesn't have

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,470
to think like a human so if it wants to

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,350
have a

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:06,870
level category system than a human would

00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:09,750
that's cool uh so thus far we've been

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:12,299
focusing on language and representation

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,600
but what happens if we think of the

00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:21,860
JavaScript runtime as a mind and compare

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:24,210
from that angle so there are a bunch of

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:27,780
metaphors that cognitive scientists will

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:31,440
use to explain attention so one of them

00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,990
is attention as a filter so you know

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,059
your attentional system is going to put

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,169
everything through like a sieve and only

00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,520
the important stuff is going to fall out

00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,830
and that's what you're going to pay

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,530
attention to another metaphor is

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,450
attention as a spotlight so the

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,730
important stuff is highlighted and

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,799
everything else falls to the wayside so

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,280
you only pay attention to the stuff that

00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:55,020
is under a spotlight there's another

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,700
metaphor which is attention is glue

00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:00,780
which is a little into the weeds of

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,340
cognitive science so there's some

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:06,210
theorists that think that when we

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:09,030
perceive we perceive these like object

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:13,080
features and then its attention that

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:17,909
binds them together into a discrete

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:20,970
object and then lastly there is another

00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:22,559
metaphor of attention as control so this

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,799
control is blocking out unwanted

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,049
distractions and automatic processes so

00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,000
an example of how attention works as

00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:31,890
executive control is this thing called

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,890
the Stroop task which you might have

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:37,200
seen in those email chains of your I

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,820
serve with this you're supposed to say

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,309
the color that the word is written in

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:43,350
and not read the word itself but this is

00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:46,559
really hard because reading has become

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,480
an automatic process for us as we get

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,289
older so it's really hard to not read

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,780
the word and to say the color instead so

00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:57,720
um none of these really applied to

00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:01,080
JavaScript because they're about a 10

00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,309
about perception and JavaScript again

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,830
doesn't perceive because it's a

00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:06,630
programming language and JavaScript also

00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,750
doesn't have automatic processes like we

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:11,460
have like for example reading I was like

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,970
well there's gotta be something here and

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,190
then

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,280
I remember this kind of back-channel

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,840
metaphor which is attention as threads

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,570
all right so we kind of think about

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,570
threads at least I do as multitasking

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,070
but yeah so we can extrapolate and use

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,020
this metaphor of attention as threads

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:36,150
but humans are really bad at

00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:38,130
multitasking um there's a bunch of

00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,860
studies that have shown this one of them

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,780
is an inattentional blindness study so

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,190
I'm just remembering this particular

00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,890
video that they showed me in my

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,450
cognitive science class I'm not going to

00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,420
spoil it in case you want to go and

00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:55,170
watch it on YouTube but the premise is

00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,850
that they tell you to you know count the

00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,930
number there's two teams passing the

00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,870
ball back and forth and you're supposed

00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:02,970
to count the number of times that only

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,970
one team catches the ball I think it's

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:09,960
the White team and if you actually focus

00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:12,330
on the task I guess watch the video if

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,520
you want but the thing is it proves that

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,110
you're really bad at paying attention to

00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,370
things or noticing things you're not

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,870
actually paying attention to so you

00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:24,390
can't really multitask there's another

00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:27,240
study which is called the dichotic

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,220
listening task in which your subjects

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,350
were presented with two speech streams

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,150
one in one year and one in the other and

00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,580
they're supposed to only pay attention

00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,920
to one and maybe do a task such as

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,050
saying take back the words that were

00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,340
spoken in one year so to make sure that

00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:44,460
you're actually paying attention to only

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,990
that but and then they were asked

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,310
questions about the other speech dream

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,150
and the other ear and they they're

00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:53,700
remembered very very little whether it

00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,620
was like gibberish they didn't even

00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,480
notice that there's no semantic

00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,010
information that goes through my

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:04,350
favorite was one of the studies

00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:06,660
presented they spoke check in an

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,040
American accent to American subjects and

00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,480
they didn't even realize that it wasn't

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,160
English there's like oh yeah everything

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,030
was good I just don't remember what what

00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:20,370
the actual content was so you could be

00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:22,530
really only can focus on one thing but

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,240
there's some light from some experiments

00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,650
about exactly what's going on with our

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,710
inability to multitask

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:32,460
so they found that if you're presented

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:34,730
with two simultaneous activities but in

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,230
different modalities so for example

00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,810
linguistic versus visual so words and

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:43,230
pictures you've more of a chance of

00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:45,960
remembering both things are being able

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,780
to attend to both things so if you're

00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,270
supposed to shadow or repeat back words

00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:54,510
subjects are able to recall information

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,950
presented in pictures better than they

00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,440
were able to remember information

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:00,000
presented in printed words and then they

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,020
were still really bad at remembering any

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,500
information spoken to them while doing a

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:09,720
shadowing task so this brings to brings

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,300
up this idea of task specific resources

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,980
or multiple capacity theory that it's

00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,930
really enough that we can't multi tasks

00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,820
that we can't do too many we have us

00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,670
we've came to too many tasks with Jin

00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,140
within one like modality silo so you

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,000
can't do too many things at once that

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:28,410
involve words you can't do too many

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,480
things that involve visual tasks so it's

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,300
just all about balancing all that if you

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,280
really want a multi task JavaScript just

00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,690
can't it's just good can't multitask at

00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,740
all right because it's it's single

00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,510
threaded so if we're actually talking

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,490
about the JavaScript runtime and

00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,460
thinking about the event loop as

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:48,210
attention javascript will only do one

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:50,130
thing for you at once but javascript is

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,920
asynchronous it's really just calling

00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:54,960
out to other api's and if we're just

00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,510
talking about javascript those dumb

00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,800
browser Steve API is even web workers

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:05,820
don't really count so JavaScript only

00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:09,300
has one capacity being JavaScript all

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:11,040
right so I had a relief uh I really

00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:14,940
enjoyed going through and comparing

00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,710
JavaScript to human cognition I've never

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,080
ever thought I would read the akwa

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:22,530
scripts back but I did or at least parts

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,600
of it and um I learned some new things

00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:28,500
about human cognition too even though it

00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,480
was my major in University uh so um I

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,090
hope that you are in some things too and

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,660
that you can use it to better your

00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:38,970
JavaScript skills um thanks for

00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,389
listening I will tweet the slides feel

00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,549
free to

00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:44,549
tweet questions at me too or sing my

00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:55,309
praises or whatever alright thanks again

00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:55,309
