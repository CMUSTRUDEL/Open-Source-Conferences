# If you wish to learn ES6/2015 from scratch, you must first invent the universe

Javascript has always been a language with very little syntactic sugar—for better or worse. With ES6/2015, and future iterations,though, Javascript is gaining a more and more abstract and expressive syntax. To some it might appear that our language—which already seems accessible and approachable for beginners—is becoming even more accessible and approachable. However, both the humanities and CS education research have proven that abstraction, while a powerful tool for knowledgeable practitioners, can be an equally powerful foil for beginners.

As we enter the era of language-level abstractions in ES6/2015, we are charged with the task of rethinking how we teach JavaScript. Through an interdisciplinary montage I will identify the problem of teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities with issues in computer science.

The talk will conclude with a discussion of how the discipline of computer science and that of the humanities can inform each other to produce more effective and creative solutions to both developing and teaching abstractions.

reject everyone I am Ashley and I am

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,619
from Queens actually a neighborhood

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,510
called Ridgewood two blocks over from

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,689
Brooklyn I actually walked between the

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,220
border every day I have some slides here

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,750
if you'd like to follow along I

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,539
recommend writing it down just because

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,730
I'm about to quote a lot of people and

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,710
so the reading list for this is well

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,690
documented in the slides and I suggest

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,629
that you check it out

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,160
so yeah hi I'm a g-dubs you might know

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,290
me from Twitter where I'm very prolific

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,670
I don't recommend you follow me

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,530
I always apologize when I hear that

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,910
happen so wouldn't do it so I'm from the

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,039
United States but I like to say that

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,530
these are more of my red white and blue

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,300
I took these pictures when I was in

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,789
cologne this is actually my second trip

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,730
to Germany this month which is pretty

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,090
cool because I really really really like

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,890
it here oh this is something I treated

00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:11,640
you guys are really awesome and I really

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,340
really dig it so yeah I am a software

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,869
engineer at the Mozilla Foundation and

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,939
you guys might have gone upstairs if you

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,280
haven't check it out and at the end of

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,470
this talk there's a chance that you

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,909
might be able to get some swag from them

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,310
they've got some really cool swag and I

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,689
have some for you alright so at the

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,060
Mozilla Foundation a lot of people don't

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,860
really know exactly what we do but the

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,040
way we talk about our mission is that we

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,170
want to foster universal open web

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,000
literacy and so that's kind of a

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,259
mouthful but the idea is that we really

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,450
want people to be ethical consumers and

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,890
creators on the web and that can be a

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,960
lot and I'm not going to really dive

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,170
into almost any of that but it's a cause

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,990
that's important to me instead what I'm

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,680
gonna say is for me this means I like to

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,479
think about thinking especially the type

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,390
of thinking that happens when people

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,729
write code and this kind of idea of mine

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,369
my goal leads me to do projects like

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,349
this where I take the idea of how people

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,420
take things apart and try and create new

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,590
learning tools for them and you're gonna

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,450
hear throughout this

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,970
talk that I care a lot about learning

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,900
tools and I actually kind of think

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:23,790
everything is a learning tool so what's

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,150
my talk about who knows maybe we should

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,800
just talk about cows in space right

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,799
that's why you guys are here right to

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,720
hear about cousin space no all right

00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:35,879
well some people have talked about art

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,000
maybe we can talk about art this is some

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:43,440
cool art that I found on the Internet

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,739
full of cool art uh but yeah maybe maybe

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,280
we'll talk about JavaScript right

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:55,079
JavaScript and maybe in more particular

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:57,120
we'll talk about es6 right yes six all

00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,650
right but what you're gonna find and

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,750
hopefully this doesn't disappoint you

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,870
but this talk is all about a lot more

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,140
than es6 and so I'm gonna start off by

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,620
talking about the idea of abstraction

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,769
all right

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,540
cows in space though maintain that so

00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,150
this wouldn't be a good talk if I didn't

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,370
quote Dijkstra right this is again a

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,709
good computer scientist would say and

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,160
here he defines abstraction he says the

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,799
effective exploitation of his kind of a

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,230
bad pronoun let's say their prows of

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,510
abstraction must be regarded as one of

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:34,130
the most vital activities of a competent

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:38,880
programmer I didn't turn my phone off

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:40,680
whoops all right so again what we're

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,359
seeing here right is that when we are

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,150
doing programming in its most

00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:49,859
fundamental we are abstracting so the

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,480
abstraction principle is defined by

00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,639
Benjamin C Pearson one of his most

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,260
foundational books called types and

00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,849
programming languages and if you haven't

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,799
read it you should check it out but here

00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:00,900
he says each significant piece of

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,000
functionality in a program should be

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,549
implemented in just one place in the

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,590
source code where similar functions are

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,260
carried out by distinct pieces of code

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,930
it is generally beneficial to combine

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,400
them into one by abstracting out the

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,810
varying parts and this should be

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,120
something that we're probably really

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,010
familiar with as developers for me this

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,620
is actually the joy of developing I love

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,050
refactoring things I love this feeling

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,570
of abstraction but I want to take this

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,610
idea and take it a step

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,800
there I want to get a little bit maybe

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,570
more academic or theoretical with it and

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,550
so to do that I obviously went to

00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,460
Wikipedia which is definitely the

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,980
academic source here it says abstraction

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,930
tries to factor out details from a

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,890
common pattern so that programmers can

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,810
work close to the level of human thought

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,790
pause on that close to the level of

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,580
human thought we're gonna come back to

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,230
this but that's pretty questionable all

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,690
right so we're close to the level of

00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:00,050
human thought leaving out details which

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:03,380
matter in practice but are immaterial to

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:06,350
the problem being solved we're gonna

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,840
flag that too in material to the problem

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,020
being solved we've got danger danger all

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,510
right keep this in mind as we continue

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,570
alright so another little anecdote uh I

00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:20,360
was the lead instructor at a boot camp

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,670
program in Brooklyn and if you have

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,130
questions about boot camps I understand

00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,600
but this one was awesome basically

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,880
really took people who had never

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,790
programmed before but also were

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,610
unemployed so you had to meet a certain

00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:37,250
criteria and then over the six months we

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,440
taught them to become developers and we

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,660
also got them jobs and so this was a

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,920
really really great program and it's

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,560
still funded today it's called the New

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,930
York City web development fellowship but

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,670
more important I think is that this is

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,130
really where I began to understand that

00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:56,290
teaching was one of the fundamental

00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:58,610
skills that a developer needs and so

00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,530
about a week before I was going to start

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,660
I was at a Ruby user group with the Dean

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,390
of the school and he was talking about

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,610
how great Ruby is as a development

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,950
language it was designed to be read as

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,260
if it was spoken by a human being

00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,910
consequently it is in English and this

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,630
was by a Japanese person which is

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,970
extremely complicated but either way

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,730
what he said was he's like look at this

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:27,770
Ruby each loop even your mom could

00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:30,610
understand that sidebar that's not okay

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,150
moms are smart and cool do not be rude

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,250
all right

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,470
so you're looking at this and you're

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,660
saying oh Ruby is so great and though

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:42,110
you might be getting the sinking

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,640
mission that I don't agree with him I

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,160
will say that at the core he had a

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,610
really important thing to say all right

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,920
JavaScript maybe too much punctuation he

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,370
is saying programs must be written for

00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,160
people to read and only incidentally for

00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,500
machines to execute and this is a really

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,480
important thing to understand all right

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,470
the people who are interfacing with your

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,360
code are primarily people the computers

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,160
involved are kind of over here the

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,020
people maintaining it the people using

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,610
it the people writing it all right they

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,850
are the people interacting and you have

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,400
to realize that they are not computers

00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:24,740
but the idea of people being able to

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:27,530
read something is tough this is my door

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,410
in Queens and you can see here I wrote

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:33,740
some notes and then you can see down

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:36,200
here the UPS person saying nope we miss

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,360
you and we could not open the door so

00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,070
again understanding what the level of

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,670
human thought is what people can read

00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,830
and understand is a tricky thing

00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:48,590
so another anecdote and as you may have

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:51,500
guessed I am NOT going to come out on

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,720
Ruby's side here so I was sitting at my

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,520
computer and my assistant instructor was

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,640
sitting in front of the class and he was

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,220
teaching iteration all right iteration

00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,810
is hard for beginners and I could hear

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,690
just through the one side of my

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,220
headphones it was not going well at all

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,440
and this has been going on for a while

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,710
and so if any of you guys know me I

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,820
decided to do something bold and that's

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,400
quite in my nature

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:20,570
and so what I did is I interrupted the

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:24,020
class and I said hey I'd like you for a

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,610
second to ignore all of the Ruby you

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,260
just learned this probably shouldn't be

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,760
hard because you're extremely irritated

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,340
and frustrated with it right now and

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,669
then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:37,550
teach you iteration using a language you

00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:40,150
don't know and they're like that sounds

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,620
like a bad idea like I know I know but

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,330
look just let me try this is already

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,210
kind of terrible let's let's just roll

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:49,460
with it and so that's exactly what I did

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,840
what I'd like to point out here is we

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:56,330
understand that the concept of iteration

00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:59,660
is really three concepts state condition

00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:02,430
increment in that Ruby

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:06,120
that's all hidden away inside that

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:09,240
keyword each but in the JavaScript I can

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,480
point to it right there because it was

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,610
exposed by the syntax the developers

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,260
that I were teaching were able to see

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,930
that and it could feel more control over

00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,620
it all right it exposed the underlying

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,240
concepts that the abstraction hid away

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,280
and as experienced developers we love

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,220
that it's in a way but beginners hate it

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,710
it's very very confusing it's this idea

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,720
of magic which sometimes we think is

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:38,160
good for beginners but it turns out that

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,140
it's not all right so my secret

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,500
physicist boyfriend Richard 5-minutes

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,170
has something to say about this a bit he

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,290
says the real problem in speech is not

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,660
precise language the problem is clear

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,020
language it is really quite impossible

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,030
to say anything with absolute precision

00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,820
unless that thing is so abstracted from

00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:03,540
the real world as to not represent any

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,970
real thing and so remember with Ruby we

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:09,870
were trying to be real we're trying to

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,910
be human language all right and so we

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,940
have these kinds of dichotomies that we

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,490
run into the desire to be precise but

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,230
also the desire to be clear and at the

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,820
same time we also want to be abstract

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,220
because we don't want to be writing out

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,870
everything but there's also a desire to

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,600
map things towards reality so they're

00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,340
easier to reason about all right and so

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,250
Pablo Picasso kind of leads us in a

00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:36,260
direction he says there is no abstract

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:39,920
art you must always start with something

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:44,160
afterward you can remove all traces of

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,050
reality so we kind of have an origin

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,150
problem here when we're designing

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,820
programming languages where do we start

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,240
on the edges of these dichotomies all

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,250
right

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,140
this is my favorite slide from every

00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,690
conference talk ever you may have seen

00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,040
it already but what I want to imply is

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,160
with programming languages

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,260
we're often doing this to our developers

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,100
all right so if you can't read it it

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,840
says how did

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,510
an owl draw some circles draw the rest

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,240
of the owl that is the only

00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,130
curse word in this talk unless I mess up

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,900
alright so but we need to understand is

00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,480
both of these instructions and the

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,830
instructions themselves are terrible

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,320
this is no good

00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,760
alright we're in this kind of lock all

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,780
right and this is all this is from

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Brooklyn not Queens

00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,480
so you can kind of be right all right

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,850
we're stuck here and so hopefully some

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,190
of you got the reference the clickbait

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,960
enos of my title which is i'm going to

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,440
be walking you through a little bit of

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,390
some Carl Sagan all right and he says

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,150
when we're doing this we need to think

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:52,470
about thinking all right and for him he

00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:54,600
says the journey starts here so let's

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,180
talk about cousin space right yeah you

00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,600
guys remember that cows in space from

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:03,270
our man Pablo Picasso all right all

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,370
right so when we think about thinking we

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,340
need to know humans are amazing at

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:12,720
pattern recognition we're able to look

00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:18,150
at something like this and see this you

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:21,540
see it right now well someone saw and

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:26,400
convinced everyone because that we have

00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:27,870
this right a cow in space so we need to

00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,360
realize when we do this pattern

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,280
recognition all right we recognize

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,010
patterns and when we name them we're

00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,890
building our abstractions now this is a

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,810
very dangerous activity because bad

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,660
abstractions are probably one of the

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:45,330
most dangerous things out there so you

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,930
might be familiar with horoscopes the

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,610
entire field of cosmology has come out

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,020
of this all right and people spend so

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,280
much time and money and worrying about

00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,780
it this is my horoscope from today maybe

00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,520
it's right I don't know maybe I'm wrong

00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,370
about this being a false abstraction I

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,990
also had this one which told me that I

00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:07,320
have nothing to worry about you guys are

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:11,280
charming so we'll see how that works out

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,530
all right so what I'm trying to say here

00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,470
is that when you're recognizing patterns

00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,130
building abstractions paving the cow

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,899
paths

00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:24,209
yes I'm sticking with this meadow

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:25,949
or we need to be very careful all right

00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,559
because again bad abstractions are

00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:29,839
extremely dangerous so now let's talk

00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,430
about JavaScript

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,709
alright javascript has been a delightful

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,019
beginning programming language because

00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:42,660
it has left a lot of abstractions and

00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:45,629
that's all about to change so September

00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:49,110
28th 1980 is when JavaScript was

00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:51,809
invented come on guys really that's not

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,610
true all right no that's when they show

00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:56,009
cosmos came out and again this was by

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,829
Carl Sagan and the key to this show was

00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:00,899
to make available the underlying

00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:02,819
scientific concepts that ruled our

00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,529
universe make that available to the

00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:07,170
layperson and this was extremely

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:08,579
important all right and in doing so he

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,769
kind of had this catchphrase where he

00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:13,529
said if you wish to make an apple pie

00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:15,899
from scratch you must first invent the

00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:17,910
universe and it has to say that to

00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,040
really understand what's going on in our

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,529
world understanding the fundamental

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:26,069
concept is extremely important I heard

00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:27,540
this and I was like yes this is the

00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:29,519
issue we have at es6

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,769
oh yeah by the way I'm not gonna say

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,639
that he has 6 2015 thing if you get

00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:36,990
upset about that I don't care all right

00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,519
so this was a girl say again this is

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,429
actually me but I'd like to think that

00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:46,589
he supports this cause all right so

00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:48,870
let's talk about es6 alright so as Gina

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:52,079
mentioned we're gonna read some of the

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:54,899
spec now yay all right so Ekman script

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,470
syntax is relaxed to enable it to serve

00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:00,449
as an easy to use scripting language now

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,249
relaxing is cool I love being in Germany

00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:04,920
I like relaxing around here have some

00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:08,519
beers but it's not always the right

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,829
message that's a real thing that was a

00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:15,600
first message on the OkCupid dating app

00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:17,069
all right is is relaxation really the

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,519
problem that JavaScript is trying to

00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:22,410
solve is were there not enough relaxing

00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:27,120
languages out there and so we have

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:29,309
JavaScript now probably not right so

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,610
what problem is JavaScript trying to

00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:34,079
solve like well Java scripts legacy be

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,149
and we look back at it as this like

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,390
strange artifact from computer science

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:41,790
and that's a really heavy question and I

00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,320
don't really know the answer but I think

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,740
it's gonna have something to do with

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:50,610
this alright and this is Laurie Voss CTO

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,709
of NPM and he says fundamentally it's

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,290
hard to think of a compelling reason a

00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:57,450
brand new web dev would learn two

00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:59,730
languages when they can just learn

00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,550
JavaScript now that might sound pretty

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,589
controversial they follow up by saying

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,390
if I could pick any language in the

00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:09,140
world to use them both the server and

00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:13,380
the client it might not be JavaScript

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:16,649
but we don't get to pick so let's think

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:21,329
about that and then we'll talk about

00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:25,350
equity script six classes you can tell

00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:29,010
what I'm gonna say right robot there all

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:31,050
right so sugar makes me sick but like

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:35,519
literally it makes me sick I have type 1

00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:38,459
diabetes but also syntactic sugar makes

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,959
me nervous and spectacular sugar makes

00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:41,820
me nervous because again we see that

00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,920
syntax always obfuscates these

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:48,930
underlying concepts so back to the spec

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,300
even though Ekman script includes syntax

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,850
for class definitions Ekman script

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:58,860
objects are not fundamentally

00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:03,269
class-based alright so you might not

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:05,669
need class syntax alright so this is a

00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:09,120
man who if any if you take anything out

00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:13,319
of this talk take this away he says

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,589
remember that all models are wrong the

00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:21,299
practical question is how wrong do they

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:25,589
have to be to not be useful what that's

00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:27,270
it in all right so how wrong are we all

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,900
right so in a class-based

00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:33,030
object-oriented language in general

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,860
state is carried by instances methods

00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:37,429
are carried by classes and inheritance

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,260
is only if structure and behavior in

00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:42,360
ACMA script the state and methods are

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:46,880
carried by objects well structure

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,929
behavior and state are all inherited

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,309
all right so that might be a little bit

00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:51,899
difficult to parse if you've never read

00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:54,539
this before I really dealt with them

00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:56,159
so I'm gonna use a blog post by this guy

00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,929
named Regan Walt who I'm gonna shout out

00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,500
for being awesome for saying stuff like

00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,659
this

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,090
he wrote a blog post called prototypes

00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:05,009
or not classes where basically and I

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,440
won't read this to you he explains the

00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:09,360
idea that classes are described as often

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,730
as boiler plates all right their

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,950
blueprints the class is the blueprint

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,799
and then we make a house from it all

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:19,740
right and the house is the object but

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:23,129
that's not true with es6 JavaScript

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,899
classes are model homes the idea here is

00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:27,570
that you have a model home and you can

00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:30,419
build a house based on it and you could

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:33,870
leave the model home empty but someone

00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:37,259
could move in I mean that since things

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:39,419
get a little tricky all right so what we

00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:42,360
understand here is that we have a syntax

00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:45,149
that cloak lis really Optus gates the

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,639
underlying functionality all right and

00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:50,429
so you might be thinking that I'm saying

00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:52,710
you know you know Java Cooper classes

00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:56,370
are their objects there they're not

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,529
classes really and maybe go home tc39

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,350
you're drunk

00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:04,409
this is me and that is ginger ale all

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:07,139
right but no that's not what I'm saying

00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:10,259
at all I'm saying this is not a hate

00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:11,759
talk in any way shape or form instead

00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,950
what I'm hoping to suggest here is that

00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,450
we take a different perspective when

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,190
we're evaluating new features for

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,440
language and that that perspective is

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,440
the educational one and so I do want to

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,789
mention just briefly all right that you

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,230
could easily shut me down by being with

00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,149
what even is a class is that even

00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,769
defined and I'd be like meet me

00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:31,289
afterwards and we can talk about this

00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:34,259
this language which introduced them it

00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:35,730
is super super awesome all right so you

00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:38,279
might be thinking that I'm trying to why

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,769
wage class warfare because I told you I

00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:43,590
was an anarchist right this is near my

00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:45,480
apartment here that's a real thing I

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,940
don't even want to deal with that all

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,940
right but instead what I'm trying to say

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:54,229
is that JavaScript might be trying to do

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:58,019
a lot of things and not be any of them

00:19:54,229 --> 00:20:00,690
if you ever go to Penn Station this is

00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:02,700
by Madison Square Garden it wasn't open

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:07,889
when I took the picture but I intend to

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:10,049
return yeah so uh listen the glam Boy

00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:12,539
has this amazing talk called syncing for

00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:15,299
programmers and in this talk he says

00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:18,389
writing is nature's way of letting you

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:22,080
know how sloppy your thinking is and so

00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:24,929
I like to take that and I say teaching

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,289
is nature's way of letting you know how

00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:29,609
sloppy your understanding is how many

00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:33,269
people in here have ever taught

00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:38,190
programming everyone who has their hand

00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:39,570
down do it it is by far the own like one

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:44,849
of the best ways to improve your

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:46,529
programming skills all right so those

00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:48,149
fancy people who are talking about

00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:49,859
programming needing to be able to be

00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:52,859
read by humans they wrote this amazing

00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:55,259
book all right and this is a huge change

00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:56,399
in computer science education what they

00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:58,830
said is we need to be teaching

00:20:56,399 --> 00:21:01,679
programming concepts not language

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,629
features when we're programming we need

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,399
to understand the activities the

00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:08,489
abstractions that we're building not

00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:10,649
where to put a semicolon all right

00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:12,509
and this is super important when we

00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:14,729
think about the idea that we have

00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:17,580
programming concepts that conflict with

00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:18,989
our syntax in JavaScript JavaScript will

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,570
be the introduction to programming

00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:24,629
concepts for an entire generation of

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:27,330
developers whether we like it or not and

00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:29,489
so we need to be cognizant of this idea

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,999
and 2.2 miles this talk we need to be

00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:34,379
empathetic of our users our JavaScript

00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:37,349
users which is going to be people

00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:39,330
learning programming all right we need

00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:41,849
to be thinking about the problem that's

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,830
being solved and oftentimes the problem

00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:46,950
that JavaScript is solving is teaching

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:49,349
people how to program so to follow up

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,909
that book sicp written by Abelson and

00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:53,249
Sussman was this excellent person named

00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,899
peter van roy and so what I'm not trying

00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:56,669
to say is that these new features are

00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:58,859
making JavaScript a terrible programming

00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:01,349
language but something a little bit

00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,940
different so he came up with this book

00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:05,339
that followed it up and he said we need

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,970
to teach programming as a unified

00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:08,770
discipline

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,299
the way he did that in his class all

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,850
right was to talk about programming

00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:15,190
languages as tools programming languages

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,590
solve problems the solutions that they

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,140
provide combined with those problems all

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,210
right to be paradigms and so perverting

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,250
the images are able to do well at one

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,809
programming paradigm sometimes they do

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,380
better at others but there's not

00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:30,730
necessarily any bad programming language

00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,110
all right and so when he taught his

00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,960
classes he would insist that people

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:36,940
start from the beginning to invent the

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,950
universe you might say and what he did

00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,049
is he had them build an entire kernel

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,789
and he says a good way to organize a

00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:45,100
programming course is to start with a

00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:48,070
simple language and then to extend this

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,320
language gradually so I'm obviously

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,299
saying all right we must invent the

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,530
universe when we teach programming we

00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:55,600
need to make sure that we teach the

00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,780
underlying concepts before we teach the

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,159
abstractions you need to feel the pain

00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,740
before you know how do you use that tool

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,409
all right so obviously every beginner

00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,120
sure at a current language right this is

00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:10,240
a really terrible idea no one should

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,980
ever do that unless yeah just no all

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,440
right but what we can take from this is

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,610
this idea of creative extension all

00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,309
right and we actually are kind of

00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,870
familiar with this all right Ron

00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:22,179
Jeffries who did extreme programming

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,980
every know if that's a thing anymore but

00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:26,049
this is something that we know always

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,600
implement things when you actually need

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:30,820
them never when you just foresee that

00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,520
you need them don't pre optimize all

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,620
right so what we need to know is that

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,630
prototypal inheritance is a big part of

00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,490
the JavaScript universe we might think

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,169
classes are useful but they're not good

00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,179
for teaching and we should not start

00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:45,429
with them all right this is how the

00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:50,080
apple pie gets made vegan-friendly

00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:53,230
metaphors all right so this is a tldr

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,789
slide so if you go back as a teacher I

00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,470
always kind of like giving an index for

00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:58,000
my points all right but what I'm trying

00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:00,100
to say is that when we look at

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,830
programming languages we need to be

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:07,120
empathetic to our audience and we also

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:09,580
need to understand that abstraction is a

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,289
difficult thing for beginners all right

00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,690
and that no matter what we do with our

00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:16,000
language when we teach we need to start

00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,649
at the beginning and now I'm going to

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,420
take the last five minutes I have to

00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:22,220
kind of put you guys on call

00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:26,000
because I have this kind of kumbaya

00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:31,940
question right what do we even mean when

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,170
we talk about programming right so this

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,360
is one of my favorite philosophers

00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,920
Martin Heidegger and you wrote this book

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,590
called what is called thinking which is

00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,030
a very bad translation of a German that

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,990
I'm not entirely sure how to pronounce

00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:47,480
either but in it he says this the most

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:50,330
thought-provoking thing in our

00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,990
thought-provoking time is that we are

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:56,540
still not thinking and you might see

00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:59,810
where I'm going with this because I'm

00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:02,060
gonna ask are we programming yet when we

00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,700
look at the JavaScript language remember

00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,830
the Dijkstra said abstraction is at the

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,410
core do you feel like that's what you

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:13,280
spend most of your time doing or is it

00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,610
just lint is it I miss the semicolon all

00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,130
right

00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,920
a lot of people like to think that

00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:22,040
things that are difficult like C++

00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,510
alright is made to be difficult to make

00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,490
sure that you're a good programmer and

00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:28,190
doing it right but I don't think that's

00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,140
a good idea at all all right there are

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,690
people in the Academy who are taking

00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,730
this idea seriously and really trying to

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:37,100
think about what programming should be

00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,350
and as they design languages designing

00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,450
for that all right and it's frustrating

00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,790
to me because this seems to only be

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,310
happening in the Academy like MIT with

00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:49,070
scratch why are we not looking at that

00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:51,680
in the industry and I think it's

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,600
something that we should be doing so

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,820
Thomas Kuhn is a philosopher and a

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,710
scientist and you wrote in this great

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,410
book the structure of scientific

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,630
revolutions that scientists worked for

00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,220
models acquired through education and

00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,970
through subsequent exposure to

00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:10,280
literature often without quite knowing

00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:12,890
or needing to know what characteristics

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:16,070
have given these models the status of

00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:18,590
community paradigms why do we want

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,950
classes are we sure that's the right

00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:23,330
thing or did just Ruby do it and a bunch

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:26,690
of other people did it and now we've

00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:28,010
decided that we need to catch up is that

00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:31,720
the perspective we really should be

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:34,100
taking so we have an awesome opportunity

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:39,110
to more radically think

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:41,570
about how we extend JavaScript all right

00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,460
we can think more radically about how we

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:46,640
build the abstractions and which ones we

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:49,370
want to build all right I'll leave you

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,580
with this Carl Sagan says it is far

00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:55,669
better to grasp the universe as it

00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:59,360
really is than to persist in delusion

00:26:55,669 --> 00:27:05,179
however satisfying and reassuring so I

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:07,130
ask you reconsider your ontology think

00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:09,190
about it a lot is this the language of

00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:15,460
these the abstractions that we need and

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:15,460
always stay a beginner thank you

00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:24,690
all right

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:36,280
all right I have a final thing and I

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,930
always like to take this back to my

00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,270
students because as I said this is where

00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:45,100
I've learned everything they have built

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:48,580
a kind of silly website called clap for

00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:51,280
Ashley and if you tweet at this hashtag

00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,900
it will pop up and clap but I asked and

00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,600
as I mentioned the Mozilla swag before

00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,950
if you could tweet something about how

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,630
you're going to stay a beginner or

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,880
commit yourself to teaching other

00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:03,310
beginners we've got some really cool

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,860
Mozilla bags that I will hand out to

00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:08,650
people who tweet great stuff so again

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:11,110
thank you and I'll leave this here if

00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:15,400
anybody wants to dive in assuming that

00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:16,840
the internet works this is always

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:22,350
awkward cuz it's like no one's clapping

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,350
for me I understand it might be broken

00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,380
