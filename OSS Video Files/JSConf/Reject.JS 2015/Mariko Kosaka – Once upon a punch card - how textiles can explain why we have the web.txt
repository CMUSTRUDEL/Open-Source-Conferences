# Once upon a punch card - how textiles can explain why we have the web

From a textile loom, to a teletype terminal, to a desktop computer, to the web; the stitches in your garment and the letters on your screen are both the result of operations executed on data.

When I first learned to code websites, I took it for granted that img-tag displayed an image because it is a “digital photo.” When I learned Node.js, saying “use Buffer” and “create a Stream” became routine. But I never really understood what a “chunk of data” looked like.

Then I started a craft project to convert digital graphics into knit patterns for an electric knitting machine. Little did I know, I was researching the origins of computing, data storage and digital communication: textile looms operated by punch cards. By knitting fabric, I learned to give instructions to a machine with just 2 signals. I discovered what a ‘bit’ really is, in my scarf! This physical, tactile experience with binary made everything in my JavaScript work much clearer.

I’d like to share my discovery process, and through some hacks and textiles give a friendly explanation about the “world of bits”.

for that warm introduction I wasn't sure

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,920
or you know you know ignoring the email

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,100
for two weeks and it wasn't two months

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,789
it was two weeks I let it I didn't apply

00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,920
to it you know things get stuff on hi

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,430
lee juck's yes wow this is the last talk

I'm so sorry I'm the one in between fine

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,330
and the tiring talk I hope this is a

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,239
little entertaining because a little bit

00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,519
of different thing and I promise there

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,729
will be JavaScript but not much about

00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:53,100
JavaScript so my name is Michael you may

00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,699
know me from this form of Twitter that's

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,570
my handle that's my other door currently

00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:00,750
this is the first time I'm actually

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:07,260
saying this in public I do textile thing

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:09,330
in JavaScript and yeah thank you and

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,920
it's funny that at the conference people

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,870
actually like comes up to me saying it

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,590
oh you are the Knitting person what do

00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,450
you actually do for living I'm a Jason

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,090
jr. at a company called scripto which is

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,030
an awesome company who lets me decide my

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,850
title completely based on my side

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,910
project scripto is not a textile company

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,920
we make software for TV shows and

00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:34,050
awesome company very supportive I get to

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,210
spend two weeks here doing textile

00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,990
research and commuting a commuting to

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,720
the company so very grateful for that so

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,730
I'm also co-organized with pjs who was

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,479
at the intro video for janaki's I again

00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,180
I have a be low video we took like that

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,670
was like past 11pm after a full day of

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,220
co-working and meet up and we had a

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,800
little drunk we took like maybe full

00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,950
takes and there's a take of like me

00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,690
lowing on the floor just like laughing

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,240
entire time so if you're interested I

00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,960
can show you at the party but brookies

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,960
you look like this

00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:14,600
and what's the awesome is that in New

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,790
York not only broken Jess but we have

00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,440
mahat andreas queen dais Georgie's

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,080
clipped so if you visit New York

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,210
literally every week we have a

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,010
JavaScript hang out so just let me know

00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,800
when you're in town we'll have a good

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:31,850
time so here's all the organizers of the

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:35,210
bolo j s family we call it and we i am

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,820
very very proud of what we built in new

00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:41,420
york community this year we have eight

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,270
speakers coming into vjax ases s calm

00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,880
and jazz conf so very proud of

00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:49,130
supportive network that we built so what

00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,650
am I talking about today I want to talk

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,380
about CS and you might think that like

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,400
oh ok CS computer science no I don't

00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,620
want to talk about computer science

00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,040
computer science makes me sad and gray I

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,320
want to talk about crafts I hands that

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,570
kind of cs and the cross science looks

00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,060
like this and this is something I've

00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:10,250
been doing for a few years more a bit ly

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,160
and extensively for past few months

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,430
which is I do this intersection of

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:21,170
coding and crafting which mainly for

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:23,570
myself my project is a knitting there is

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:27,170
a little bit of background to why or how

00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,360
I came to this intersection so I was a

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:33,830
hung nado first I wasn't engineer first

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,930
I learned in it when I was seven maybe

00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,880
once a year I make like a little scarf

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,130
and it was something that wasn't like

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,500
serious hobby but like a light hobby

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,300
that I do every year four years ago I

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,090
moved to New York City I didn't have a

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,300
work visa so I had nothing to do and I

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,360
was so bored that bored enough to put

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,940
myself into learning to code um I've

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,860
been in tech industry for my career and

00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,750
I was a p.m. so like I was comfortable

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,450
with like talking about tiki stuff but

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,550
never got around actually learning to

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,170
code but I was bored enough to put

00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:11,510
myself into JavaScript tutorial and

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,970
doing that i noticed that like Oh

00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,010
javascript is actually helpful for my

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,350
knitting and I dug up the tweet that I

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,850
do member that I tweeted about this and

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,280
it's in Japanese so you can't leave you

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,230
lead it maybe some of you can but it's

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,300
hang that like oh I need a discount

00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,010
erful project that I'm doing to keep

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,590
track of like how many lows that I knit

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,660
I learned java script so in 30 minutes i

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:38,240
use the plaza and dom and that was super

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:40,940
useful fun that's 2013 8 months before i

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,400
get a job as a javascript engineer so

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,560
when i'm doing knitting in the

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,540
JavaScript learning JavaScript I noticed

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,350
there is a correlation between needing

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:53,419
and coding and knitting is very binary

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,020
processed much like programming is ones

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:58,700
and zeros atomic unit for knitting is

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,310
two stitches the type of stitches knit

00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,880
stitch and purl stitch and you can see

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:07,430
there that there is a two distinct face

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,990
of the fabric that they produce so if

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,970
you look if you have a sweater you can

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,729
just look at the pattern of it it is a

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:17,479
combination of knit or purl stitches in

00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:20,419
here represented as a KO key so the two

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,190
by two living that's all sometimes using

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:25,340
the cuff of your sweater or neckline is

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,530
a to knit stitches to purl stitches and

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,510
the one on the left is a little more

00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,860
into get pattern but if you just closely

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:37,160
look at it it is the alternate KPK p

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:39,380
slightly shifting to the left on top of

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,620
that the instruction of how to make

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:46,880
scarf or how do you make a sweater comes

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,280
in this form and to me it looks a lot

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,039
like code there is like a leap heating

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,919
letters and maybe some kind of valuables

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,630
there is a more explicit loop happening

00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:00,350
like knit until two stitches remaining

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:02,930
goalie Pete from spar to the end so that

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,330
means you can knit in JavaScript because

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,600
knitting is code so let's take a look at

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:11,240
this pattern for the first line says co5

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,150
and let's just do it in JavaScript socio

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,180
means cast on and that means that just

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,669
create a space so that you can start

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,560
it's not a stitch yet so it's kind of

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:26,030
like you're cleaning empty LA but like

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:29,690
links of five and casting on so next

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,880
line is k 5 and k stands for knit stitch

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,950
and 5 means how many times you need to

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,709
do it so that means this line is saying

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,989
like knit five stitches

00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:42,259
so I cleated the value of okay who is

00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:45,619
litter capital k and they placed a low

00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:47,929
zero with 5 case in it fallout you put

00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:51,889
it into my scarf parent LA and now you

00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:53,479
need it one low in JavaScript the second

00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,610
line gets a little tricky so the thing

00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:59,599
about knitting is that it's Oh episode

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:01,939
on the needle so the previous la the

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,739
links of the previous la always inherit

00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,329
it to the next low like you can't start

00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:07,849
the five stitches and then next low be

00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:08,959
100 stitches well technically there is a

00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:13,189
way to do it but like a little more

00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:15,529
complicated so you inherit the links

00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:17,209
from the previous low could a new la and

00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:19,579
then from there you count how many

00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:21,949
stitches and what to do so the first one

00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:24,889
we already know k 2 means knit two

00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,839
stitches so I put knit stitches count up

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,869
the index so now you have a two stitches

00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,779
in your La next one is a new concept m1

00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:34,819
which is make one stitches and it's a

00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:36,469
lot like operating the splice method on

00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,749
yo la and putting in like another

00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:41,239
element into your la so like you know

00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:44,509
past the index where you are put the new

00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:47,749
stitches now the LA is length of 6 and

00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:50,689
then here you have a loop and it's

00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:52,729
saying that how many ever you have on

00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,999
your needles just knit until last

00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:59,899
remaining two stitches so in this case

00:07:55,999 --> 00:08:01,489
you only put one stitches but you do the

00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:05,689
while loop until the remaining stitches

00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:08,059
or two and next one we already did that

00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:10,399
like same thing like eating make one now

00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:13,339
your legs it's seven and then you two

00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,319
now your second law is complete push it

00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:18,979
through the my parent my scarf away and

00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:21,559
now you have to erase or to lowes of

00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:24,079
knitted fabric there so continue in

00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:28,279
doing that it looks like this to create

00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:30,679
a triangle-shaped scarf and what I

00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,689
always thought was that the meaning is

00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:34,120
like you are compiling your code or

00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:37,089
knitting pattern in your brain

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,550
interpreting it and then executing the

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:43,610
computation on your hand and needles so

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:46,399
that the flea yarn that the yambo is a

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,779
flea memory and then the fabric is

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,130
allocated memory

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:55,240
now do you ugly that the knitting is

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:57,100
like coding yeah yeah on top of that

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,160
when you're designing your own knitted

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,870
fabric it is a lot like math like

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,960
calculator is your friend you need a

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,940
graph paper Here I am deciding on the

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,160
design of the slope of the armhole and

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,970
then trying to decide how to decrease it

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:16,779
so that it comes naturally to my bus

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:19,870
line and you need to fit it in fit the

00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:22,060
patterns into a certain public the

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,730
Allstate it's a lot turns into like a

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,190
puzzle because you don't want the nice

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,010
piece of pattern to be ended on the side

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,020
you want it to be center so I enjoy that

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,150
and I have a tendency that like if I

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,150
like something I just go to you like

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:39,490
that thing forever and I don't sleep and

00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,529
then go like deep deep down down there

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,660
so like Eileen II wanted to investigate

00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:46,690
a lot of Potter making a lot of knitting

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,550
I found although hun inning takes time

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,580
and then I found the machine code

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:54,820
knitting machine which lets me make

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:57,190
public way faster than I hum net and

00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,490
this is me creating a scarf that I have

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:04,779
in here but it's basically a machine

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:07,270
that lets me do my job faster it is not

00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:10,560
a new thing my machine is from 80s and

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:14,800
these machine has been around things

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,589
1500 my machine turned out to be a

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,529
electro knit which is a computer

00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:23,130
operated machine that lets me send the

00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:27,040
data into the machine so that I can

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:29,770
program the pattern and I did a little

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,560
bit of a project about taking a digital

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,930
photo image turning in to bitmap image

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,209
turning into ones and zeros away turn it

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,790
into that file by bit shifting and then

00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:42,580
printing out in my knitting machine and

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:45,160
I gave a talk about that at rjs conf us

00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,510
past May and if you have any question or

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,450
if you want to know more about how i did

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,940
it i'm happy to talk so later but today

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:55,870
i will talk about what came after that

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,240
project so my machine was the first one

00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,920
to have a computer operated version but

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,220
the version before was using

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,670
being cold punch guard and I have it

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:10,040
here and in investigating how knitting

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,630
machine works I was super fascinated

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,440
first of all this is beautiful

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:18,290
and I was so fascinated that I can

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,889
control the machine by just perforated

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,120
paper punch guard and I again go down

00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,459
the lab at whole of researching

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,760
something and I realize that punch cards

00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:30,949
are actually cool it touches at some

00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,010
point of history it touches automation

00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:36,380
of the Machine and computation of doing

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:38,540
the bath on the data and then touches a

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,060
communication and all of three which I

00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,699
consider a base of computer and internet

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,470
and like what we deal with every day

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:47,360
punch core touch that in history so a

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:51,800
little bit of information let's talk

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,470
about like what automation so in 1745

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,600
Jack Kevorkian was commissioned by

00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:00,320
French government to create an automated

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,019
job textile loom for local silk industry

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,180
and he was the first one I mean before

00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:07,130
that there was like a concept of using a

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,529
punch core to operate the machine but he

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:13,839
was the first one to make up for fully

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:17,320
automated loom operated by punch card

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:21,019
didn't get picked up quite well until

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,060
1800 when Joseph merely jacquard picked

00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:25,850
up the project and then included and

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:29,300
created this famous loom called jacquard

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:32,060
loom side note it's interesting that the

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,540
the British text Islanders were an

00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,220
industry was up-and-coming so Napoleon

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:40,040
spend money actually on the local

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,050
business the Leon and they got like

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,560
increasing number of order so they need

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:47,779
a machine to make those order and he was

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,110
commissioned by a merchant and beyond to

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:53,690
clear those machine this is a jacquard

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,790
loom that I just took part of my

00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,589
research trip to textile museum in

00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,480
Netherland this is how it works it's

00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:02,930
feeding the punch card and then

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,269
selecting the thread in the machine to

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,880
create a textile pattern and here's a

00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:09,459
jiff animation from five years animation

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,560
from Victoria and Albert Museum

00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:14,880
basically upon score gets pushed Lords

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,580
are pushed or not pushed

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:22,020
and then the Slayer attached to that is

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:26,720
picked up by and then wait for it goes

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:31,680
down there to show yes this is how

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,810
pixels or select it so this is another

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,480
fine from the textile museum it is

00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,430
discussing mechanism of the jacquard

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,830
loom but to me it looks a lot like

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,170
explaining how computer graphics and

00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:46,080
pixel works and I was like so like

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,540
fascinated by that when I found out so

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,340
that was just using punch cord to

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,120
operate a machine like how about

00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:56,940
computation part so cold sackhoff was

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,190
the first one to know to use the punch

00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,920
court as a data storage and he was a

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,880
statistician who wanted to do faster

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,760
work on his research he proposed this

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,520
thing called linear home scope and

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:15,060
basically it is a shelf with the hole

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,490
and data in it he pleads a pins kind of

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,440
like a query he learns that pin over the

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,720
shelf and then if that came matches with

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,170
the whole you find the data faster than

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:29,280
going through by hand another one

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:31,200
Charles Babbage from England could he

00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,200
planned the famous machine analytical

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,720
engine which use punch cord as a data

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,820
input and Charles Babbage was the one

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,120
the Ada Lovelace was exchanging a letter

00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:45,000
which we some of you may know that he

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,060
became first computer program Lovelace

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,010
made a beautiful beautiful quote about

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,170
this machine saying the analytical

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,060
engine weaves all algebraic patterns

00:14:52,170 --> 00:15:00,810
just like a jacquard loom leaves flowers

00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:03,330
and leaves like great back in united

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,160
states in the united states there was

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,560
another attempt to use punch cord for

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,130
computation which is by home and hollis

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,930
in 1889 he created this machine code

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,690
tabulating machine it's basically punch

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:19,140
court's order to sort out data faster

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,840
and it came out of need from US Census

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:25,860
so US Census happens every ten years and

00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,690
the census in 1880 took nine years to

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,730
compile that data because they did not

00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,899
have any

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,120
equipment there was a lot of immigrant

00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,920
coming in they did the hunt compile of

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,749
the data and it took nine years so like

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,399
why by the time you get old analysis

00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:40,139
done you know another sensors what's

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,269
happening and it was gonna be problem

00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,629
the next census so he created the

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:47,910
machine called tabulating machine and

00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:50,639
here is a picture of Lady inputting the

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,319
data into a punch card by the way the

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,809
tabulating machine company through

00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,149
different acquisition became what is

00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:58,980
known as IBM right now and then now it

00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:03,149
all makes sense that the IBM machine

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:05,220
punch card it all came from there so the

00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:07,439
communications part also attached on the

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,059
perforated paper roll punch card before

00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:13,620
going to the punch core there's like a

00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:15,269
little prehistory 1864 there was a first

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,240
telegraph service happening between

00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:20,040
Washington DC and New York it used the

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,559
piano like keyboard and then two

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,149
operators were sitting at the end

00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:25,889
appearing the thing and soon they

00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:29,759
realized that they need to have a

00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:32,309
standard communication way so the bow

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,430
dog amilo balda in france created this

00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:37,920
five bit five you know ones in zero

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:42,120
system called bout it system and adopted

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,699
in france but then in 1901 Donald Murray

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,759
was the first one who introduced this

00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:52,139
use of perforated paper or punch card as

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,759
a part of teletype so what he introduced

00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,100
was that instead of like typing and

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,319
ending the data immediately just type it

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,230
into the paper and then create the paper

00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:04,110
so so that the papers like those dolls

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:07,350
are queued up and it doesn't basically

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:10,380
the process becomes nonlinear and you

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:13,559
can queue up the data he actually walked

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,120
on the bow to code and became what is

00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:18,600
known as international Telegraph

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,689
alphabet which still use the five bit so

00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,909
they need it like space to represent all

00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:26,549
the letters and they introduce the idea

00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:29,730
of shifting and that's why you have a

00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:33,450
shift key in your computer so basically

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:35,970
they have a figure and letters and

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,860
whenever that the shift two letters

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,530
signal happens then after that

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,870
everything gets lead as a letters and

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,809
then

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,880
you see the shift to figure signal

00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:49,540
happens then after that everything after

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,400
that is lead as a figure of course if

00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,590
you talk about the encoding system i

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,430
have to mention ascii which is American

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,460
Standard Code for information

00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:59,530
interchange somebody did not really

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,720
think about diversity somebody saw 7-bit

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,640
is enough letters to the prince and all

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,300
the communication letter which is not

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,520
enough but they let use the 128

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,400
characters but then computer happened

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,890
the computers are a bit and like who are

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,350
not level of bits now available to you

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:19,510
and there was a lot of multiple

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,070
standards like Nordic country started

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,929
making their own standards because they

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,750
needed their own letters to be

00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:27,790
represented country like Japan my home

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,280
country decided to this weird thing

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,990
called multi-byte encoding which is very

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,980
programmatic when you are dealing with

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:40,660
Japanese computer program till this day

00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:43,059
um then there was a vodka unicode unique

00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,120
unified universal encoding and if any of

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:48,820
you want to geek out about like how

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,010
awesome you t expect is like i'm more

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,710
than happy to do that but not going into

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,390
today so i was like after this like holy

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,420
search i was like wow that was a lot of

00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,309
wikipedia lead but then like punch card

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:04,210
is like actually really cool I want to

00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:07,420
make one so i quickly prototype dip out

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:11,260
of team foil and nope card and jumper

00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:13,059
wires didn't nearly walk out so my part

00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,490
was that the the jumper wire is a leader

00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:17,559
so like kind of like moves through it

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,900
and then lead it but didn't really work

00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:21,940
i went back to lie collisional drawing

00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,240
of like how jock Harlan was made and

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,040
then like sketched up how it's gonna get

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,370
hit down to my friends with job cut some

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,070
good measure some things pork some hole

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,620
put the contact sheet on it and then

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:39,010
forget to algae we know and then now

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:41,890
that's there so I have that machine here

00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,480
and I wrote an interpreter so basically

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,850
the machine itself is just leading a

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,679
data the data and then what to do with

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,179
it afterwards up to me as a computer

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,020
programmer so i created this demo site

00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,550
electromechanical the computer by the

00:19:53,020 --> 00:20:00,160
way i'm so so

00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:01,840
no my domain purchased that was

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,720
available by the way doc computer space

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,680
wide open you should you should check

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:13,540
that um so I'm going into the demo site

00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:19,000
and I have a punch card that made put it

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:28,140
onto the machine on the side and it's

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:31,270
seif since yay so that's ! and this one

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:35,520
that's a little I oh I'm doing demo

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,520
backwards it what's supposed to say hi

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,730
there

00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:52,420
so so I created two demos one is leading

00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:54,190
the same la the binary are a turning

00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,900
into ascii character so you can see the

00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,120
letters the other one is much like a

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,600
jacquard loom trying to create a textile

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,750
pattern so a little bit about how this

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,990
thing hole gets together each pins that

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:10,270
a pins are buttons so i use it Johnny 5

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,820
and then created the eight buttons and

00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:15,130
each button has a events / hold all

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,770
these so every time the button gets hold

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,440
is okay socket i/o to omit the WebSocket

00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:23,290
to my server and then same as a release

00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,260
and every time that event immediate i

00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:29,110
send the index of which pin was hold or

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,660
live east on the server side it's very

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:34,120
simple i always have a pattern eight

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,760
zeros and then whenever socket comes in

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:41,080
we placed our index with one and then

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:44,740
purse that data into ASCII characters on

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:48,100
the demo of the textile side I use the

00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:50,620
same LA to see if it's zero create a

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:54,730
white canvas box and then if it's one

00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:57,370
create a black canvas box so after this

00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,880
exercise I was like I finally understand

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:03,460
how code works and computer Lee's my

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,309
code this is super cool I can create my

00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,890
own punch card language in you know

00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:12,010
whatever way but then like dealing with

00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,990
binary is not as friendly as you think

00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:17,260
it's just like you are always looking at

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:21,460
art of like binary to hex to octal to

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:24,190
it's just not fun likely as JavaScript

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,860
programmers have a way to do this in

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:29,049
JavaScript and skip hole punch card and

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,870
binary system which is make your own

00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:33,160
parser so this summer I tended the

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,590
program called school for poetic

00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,559
computation and their attended the class

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:41,350
by solid golf Miller called talking to

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,350
machines those and it was

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:46,630
basically a class about how to create

00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:50,580
your own domain specific language and

00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:53,740
how to create a parser for it so I use a

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,500
library called Peggy is which is a

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,850
parser generator for JavaScript and they

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,730
have like nice interface folder online

00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:04,700
editing they have a so basically you

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:07,040
create your own glamour in pegs way and

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,850
then peg compile it into generator and

00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,860
then they have a little interactive

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:17,090
tester to see if it works so let's see

00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:19,280
they have a simple glamour define and

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,200
then in here they have white space

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,060
defined so what if I don't want any

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,070
white space in my language that I'm

00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:28,640
designing so like I just get a little of

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:30,680
that then now the parcel is yelling at

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,600
that like I am not expect expecting

00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:38,630
white space there is white space so like

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:43,220
I get a little bit then it will say /

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:45,770
successfully so I did this exercise for

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,340
my thing and created my own domain

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:51,980
specific language called 64 stitches and

00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:55,670
specifically in the purpose to teach

00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:59,270
programmers how knitters lead knitting

00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:02,180
patterns so the D language itself is

00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:05,720
designed to look like exactly like a

00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,730
knitting pattern instead of using K&P I

00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,100
use underscore and asterisks to the

00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:13,430
present a white space in black space so

00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:18,980
that kind of like being able to see it

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:20,810
visually um so let's zoom in if I so

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:24,350
remember when we did the JavaScript

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:26,540
knitting cast on is how how wide the

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:31,250
start with it so if i change that cast

00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:33,410
on eight to 16 it's wider width and then

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:36,320
if i go to like a weird one that's like

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:39,380
four then oh it's not the weird it's

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,380
like three completely changes the shape

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:47,990
of the pattern and then you can change

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:52,520
that to be completely white low or

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:54,940
completely black low notice that the

00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,980
until 32 stitches remaining I

00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:00,110
specifically Royals parser so that the

00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,860
programming language that I that user

00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:08,990
need to use is a language that the

00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:11,900
knitting machine uses so I made that and

00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,620
I tweeted thinking that maybe 10 of my

00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,980
friends

00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:18,910
nerd about things would like it and I

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:24,890
never expected to get this much positive

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:26,570
feedback um I was never like a popular

00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,350
JavaScript library programmer so like I

00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:33,200
was like wow people are weird people

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:34,970
like weird stuff but it was great a lot

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,710
of like London people started tweeting

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,390
at me there screen shot of their code

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:42,230
and the pattern because i made the

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:44,870
online app to be interactive so that the

00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,940
patent that the code itself always gets

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,070
compiled every time the key up event

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:52,460
happens and change the pattern so i

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,460
added the feature to for those to say

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,260
the pattern and here is some example

00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:00,140
this user i'm like particularly plow

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,750
that at my code or sample was clear

00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,960
enough that she used loop in her coat

00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:08,270
and a lot of people ended up using that

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:13,870
as like a mini pixel orange in the later

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:19,460
so here's a cat here's a skull and

00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:21,920
invaders and of course jeaious lighting

00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:25,700
my own parser turned out to be great

00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,320
exercise in learning ideas and computer

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,300
science that i never learned because i

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,059
did not take computer science which is

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,520
abstraction the writing glamour for the

00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:36,980
passer is basically like saying like in

00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,110
English you have like noun and verb and

00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,720
you know it has to go in a certain order

00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,760
same thing like I have to define what

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,130
castellón is and I have to define what

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,010
loop is and then going into smaller

00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,830
chunks smaller chunks small chunk and

00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:53,150
kind of like learn oh this is what

00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:57,980
abstraction people are talking about

00:26:53,150 --> 00:27:01,610
this is I get it now and also I stopped

00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,860
being mad at the JavaScript console

00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:06,080
yelling at me on the eller because I

00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,170
learned that the lighting meaningful

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,300
eller for the parser is super hard so

00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:13,880
now like undefined is not a function I'm

00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:19,200
okay with that

00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:22,440
so what's next I have no idea I really

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,700
don't I'm just like way into this punch

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,279
car thing and I want to clean my own

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,889
language and now I don't know what comes

00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:31,289
next although I have few ideas of what i

00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:34,260
wouldn't do next one just put

00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:36,330
the code on github I'm like the person

00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,580
food cleats like empty github repo

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,289
saying like this will be this project

00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,730
and never puts the code in and like I

00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:43,200
have no laser vision of putting in

00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:46,080
closed source or anything I'm just being

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,279
lazy so I'll do that and then next one

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,250
is like I want to make an appt for

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:53,010
knitter so this year I've had a great

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:55,710
opportunity a lot of opportunity to talk

00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,870
to people like you techies about like

00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:00,269
how knitting is like a code and how

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:04,710
knitting can teach your computer science

00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:07,740
but knitters themselves who does not use

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,960
my hack on my code contribute a lot to

00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,730
what I do which is creating a patterns

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,159
cleaning instruction for knitting

00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:17,490
machines so I want to make a tool for

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:21,269
them so that they can put more into this

00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:23,850
research and nearly what i wanna do is

00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:27,269
like explore the idea of like cleft as a

00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:29,880
computer science and I'm ed I've never

00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:32,039
like computer science until I did this

00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,570
project and then now I really want to

00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:38,120
learn about what computer science is

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:41,820
about so hopefully in past 30 minutes I
