reject for me personally reject is way

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,010
more than just the conference it's it's

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,690
a very special place with very special

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,719
people and they're all gathering here

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,670
and it's it's about much more than just

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,710
technology it's really about the people

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,430
that are here and that's very very dear

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,619
to my heart so reject chess used to be a

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,500
tiny community conference and it has

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,179
become a big conference over the years

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,099
now it's still run by people from the

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,070
community for the community and it's a

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,140
very special time this year because it's

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:42,260
the fifth anniversary and it's a big

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,700
celebration music they started as like

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,129
overflow conference to jay's calm you

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,500
give people a chance to reject it at

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,890
jess come to you or either ticket prices

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,210
or by like not getting accepted so this

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,469
is very good idea to get more people

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,969
into the community and give them a

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,969
chance to be part of a solo thing

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,539
actually this projector is the first

00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:26,560
protect yes and we're celebrating a

00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:28,840
birthday but unfortunately it's the last

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,340
one they're very sad about that but we

00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,890
think it's time to move on and there are

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,259
also so many amazing things that went

00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:41,319
out like started with the rejecters and

00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:44,530
still going on so yeah it's time to make

00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:56,700
room for them so it's the laughing and a

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:56,700
