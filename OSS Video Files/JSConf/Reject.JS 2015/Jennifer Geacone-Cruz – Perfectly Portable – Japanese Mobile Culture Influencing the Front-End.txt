# Perfectly Portable – Japanese Mobile Culture Influencing the Front-End

Today’s development environment is heavily focussed on “mobile first”, but the long-term transition to this framework has been a challenging one. From mobile technology’s first forays into web connectivity, user-friendliness, and market shaping, Japanese mobile culture has without a doubt had a lasting influence on how we make our development and design decisions.

This talk traces the advent of the mobile first paradigm from its roots in the Japanese mobile revolution, through to the power within the country’s changing topography of market end-users, and some of the current issues that face mobile development and design in both Japan and the West. How did Japan’s early mobile connectivity set the pace and priorities for not only burgeoning technology, but also the incipient business models that would grow to dominate our tech culture? Has the advent of smartphones really evened the playing field?

Through the lens of cultural psychology, technological history, and market analytics we’ll take a closer look at how and why our mobile web is inextricably linked to Japan.

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,129
being here um so as allah mentioned my

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,809

Twitter i'm also with living style gorg

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,410
which is an open source project for

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,480
creating living style guides um as a

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:05,040
ruby gem and a little bit more on that

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,369
later um i am a product infrastructure

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,530
designer linguist and japan ologist um

00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:12,750
and so some people aren't always

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,220
entirely sure what it is that I do but a

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,380
lot of what I do is going to be

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:23,490
explained or evidenced in my talk today

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:25,920
um oh there you um the title of my talk

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,780
is perfectly portable Japanese mobile

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,490
culture influencing the front end some

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,210
people might wonder how I arrived at

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,549
such a topic um well this is an

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,729
extension of a talk that I gave last

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,549
March at up front and in that talk I

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,619
discussed Japanese web and front end and

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,619
the factors that influence it and what

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,200
makes it so Japanese one of the sections

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:56,820
of my talk touched on Japanese mobile

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,409
phones also called Kate thide n1 and how

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,409
their growth into staple of Japanese

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,600
life in the 90s and Beyond shape the way

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,610
that Japanese web sites and the front

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,110
end work incepted structured and

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,179
ultimately how they've changed or

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,010
haven't changed in response to the way

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,879
that people use them

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:20,079
so today's going to be focusing a little

00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,909
bit more on mobile phones and this talk

00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:25,120
is going to focus on the role of the

00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:28,629
mobile phone in Japan both past present

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,560
and future Japan's influence on mobile

00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:35,170
design and development the current

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,170
mobile at culture and web in Japan and

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:41,739
the future of Japanese mobile culture as

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,750
evidenced from the past and also the new

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:49,150
smartphone culture that's cropped up in

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:51,220
the last seven years or so so what I'd

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,170
like to do autumn is to start off by

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,180
getting an idea of what you all know

00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,579
about Japan um can I have a show of

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:03,760
hands has anyone here actually been to

00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:06,940
Japan before okay and so of those of you

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,099
who haven't what's your impression of

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:15,720
mobile phones in Japan and how they're

00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:20,290
used to any volunteers maybe shouts okay

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:24,669
anyone else okay so we have some ideas

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,560
about what it is um but actually it's

00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:29,410
not always the way that it seems to be

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,290
um so here we've got a selection of Kate

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,639
I denwa Japanese flip phones I chose the

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,099
flip phone because I'm a little bit

00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:40,329
nostalgic for the late 90s and early

00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:42,190
2000s when I first went to Japan um and

00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:44,019
actually this was one of the first times

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,389
that I had a mobile phone i went to

00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:49,090
japan in 2002 after completing my grad

00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:51,099
work and up until that point I hadn't

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,810
really had a mobile phone before I had

00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,150
only had one for the last six months I

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,659
was studying in the US and at that time

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:01,090
we had those awful Nokia's that had the

00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:02,889
replaceable face plates and they

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,169
couldn't really do very much except play

00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:08,199
one game and they were really difficult

00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:10,060
to SMS and there really wasn't much of a

00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,930
mobile phone culture in the u.s. at that

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:16,209
time but when I arrived in Japan I saw

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,070
mobile phones like this and I saw people

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,959
actually doing things with them they

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,240
were looking at the web they were

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,550
writing each other a really long email

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,960
some people were reading novels on their

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,870
web

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,150
so to me that was completely shocking

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,460
and immediately I was hooked because

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,530
this vibrant culture that existed in

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:41,490
Japan was unlike anything I'd ever seen

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:43,319
before um so to give you an idea of the

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,780
role of the mobile phone in Japanese

00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:50,520
culture and let's start with some

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,949
numbers um japan has a ninety-five

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,860
percent mobile subscription rate that's

00:04:52,949 --> 00:05:01,440
about 130 4.8 million subscribers now

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,940
that's a lot I mean most countries don't

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,199
have that kind of subscription rate at

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,570
all of these 79.7 percent of the

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,550
subscribers are mobile Internet users so

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:15,630
roughly one hundred and seven point five

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:19,139
million that racks up to more than twice

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,270
the US average for web access on mobiles

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,620
this means that Japan is one of the

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,050
breeding grounds for not only web

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,090
technology but also for mobile web and

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,900
this is going to become more and more

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,610
evident as the talk it's all right um so

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,889
how did japan get there how did they get

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,990
such a high market penetration how did

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:39,270
they get people so actively using their

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,979
mobile phones to access the web well

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,430
it's all starts with a little bit of

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:49,080
catch up on history on mobile web so

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:51,389
let's go back to the 90's and although

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,840
the first actually commercially offered

00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:58,680
mobile web was merged in finland in 1996

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,289
on the nokia 9000 in the 90 110 series

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,150
in 1997 which i'm particularly fond of

00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:05,849
because it was featured in that awful

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,729
movie with alkyl over the st. if you

00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:10,680
would remember that at all this was

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:13,820
offered by sonara andrade alenia

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,020
networks and there was kind of

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,940
accessible to the sense that like it

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,650
actually existed and people could use it

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:24,389
but it wasn't something that was part of

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:27,870
everyday life until the mobile web boom

00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:30,419
in Japan and that happened around 1999

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,940
and this happened when NTT DoCoMo which

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:35,760
is one of the big three providers of

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,650
mobile service in Japan introduced the

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,430
first commercially offered browser

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,060
specific

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:45,090
mobile web service called I mode this

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,670
was a revolution because nobody really

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,590
had such a broad access to the internet

00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,750
from their mobile phone before it was

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,610
very much about direct connections to

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,560
the network but here they were able to

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,430
package it within a commercial framework

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,920
it was based on C HTML which was around

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,980
for a hot minute back then HTML which

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,930
was around for a little bit longer and

00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,840
WD ml which was around a little bit

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,570
later and a little bit longer as well

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,090
and also proprietary alp and TLP

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,800
protocols which was a huge jump forward

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,610
because they were able to provide

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,920
customized content um this happened by

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,700
actually literally pressing an eye mode

00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:29,340
button so the button had this little

00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,290
logo there and it was a button on the

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,120
phone itself and you pressed it and you

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,550
got connected to the web and there was a

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,440
little animation that showed like some

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:41,400
kind of connection happening as if a

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,620
virtual coupling had happened and that

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,230
was a pretty exciting moment because you

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,120
were wherever you were on the train you

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,250
were at school you were walking down the

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,900
street sitting in the park and you could

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:56,670
actually get some information um the

00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,130
content was controlled by the provider

00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:01,230
via the I mode websites so actually in

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,290
this case since I mode was provided by

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,480
ntt docomo NTT DoCoMo was responsible

00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,600
for developing the website that the web

00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,730
phone could access and this allowed for

00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,680
better provider control over pricing &

00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:16,380
billing because it was applied to both

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,060
send and receive data packets and here

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,670
you see that there's a lot of type

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,100
control over the exchange of data the

00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,780
volume of data control and they had a

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,330
really tight lid on their networks which

00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:30,390
is sort of an ongoing theme in Japanese

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,850
mobile providers and it didn't really

00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:36,480
loosen up until rather recently and I'll

00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:39,660
get to that in a little bit so you had a

00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,240
phone like this you here's the I mode

00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,760
screen you would hit the I mode button

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,570
which was often one of the buttons that

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,770
had an alternate use or sometimes there

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,960
was a little extra button down here

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,600
depending on the model

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,180
you had what's interesting about this

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,000
phone is it's a gadda k which is a also

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,890
a domestic phone so it's a phone that's

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,600
produced for domestic use in Japan and

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,850
I'll explain a little bit more about

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,230
them a little bit later as well so they

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,300
could have all of these extra

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,930
proprietary buttons that were specific

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,060
to the carrier's that sold them so you

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,130
would press the I mode button you'd get

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,970
connected you'd get to your I mode

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:22,430
screen and then what would happen is is

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,470
that you would actually encounter a

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:27,830
screen that looked like this and this is

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,020
where you would jump off in later years

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,240
a lot of these screens were actually

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,550
partnered up with providers like Yahoo

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,560
which is one reason why Yahoo is still a

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:41,150
massive massive influence in Japanese

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:44,060
web there was often directly a yahoo

00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:49,220
menu that came down on the Left we have

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,780
I mode which was ntt docomo um and you

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,210
can see that there's lots of linking

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,270
happening you would use the numbers to

00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,340
navigate down through on the right we

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:04,010
have easy web which is the similar

00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:06,290
system analog for a UK DDI which is

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:09,950
another one of the big three providers

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:12,220
the third provider was j phone which

00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:15,860
then became vodafone which is now

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,110
softbank and they had something called j

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,550
sky i happen to have a j phone when i

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,230
first arrived there it was the most

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,330
futuristic looking thing I'd ever seen

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,880
with silver it looked like a tiny

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,040
spaceship it flipped open it made

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:32,510
awesome noises I could play at least

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:35,930
five games whoo and um yeah and it was

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,640
it was a huge revelation for me and for

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,980
a long time this was my only way to

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,480
access the internet and you know what it

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:48,860
wasn't just me it was pretty much

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:51,260
everybody um so um a lot of providers

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:55,250
still followed suit so we had the easy

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:57,410
web a UK DD IJ sky IJ phone this put

00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,960
japan in scandinavia at the forefront of

00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,970
mobile web usage and this was long

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,880
before any web ready handsets had become

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,340
proliferated in the US and europe

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,290
as I mentioned before and this opened up

00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,170
a whole new system ax tised way for

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,180
navigating the web on the go so as I

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,060
said this was mostly the main way for

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,620
people to access the web this was before

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,530
home internet connections were really

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,900
the norm in Japan most people from the

00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:26,110
90s on until a lot of points in the

00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,220
mid-2000s so around 2005 a lot of people

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,010
i knew still didn't have home internet

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,200
connections and they would have most of

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,000
their internet access either at work or

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,310
at school and if they weren't there it

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,550
was through their internet phone so that

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:42,930
was one of the reasons why japanese

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:45,400
mobile web became such a huge influence

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,830
this means that the market traction for

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:51,250
accessing web via mobile also became the

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:53,650
evolution of japanese web front-end and

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,120
this was partially them what was

00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,790
actually mostly the point of the first

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,690
talk so really Japan was mobile first

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:04,090
before lots of other places so how did

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,480
we arrive at such an early mobile first

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:11,470
approach well this is through people

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:14,520
practices and power um wow man and hey

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,840
thornthwaite in there really fantastic

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,640
research piece the Internet of everyday

00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,710
life said it really elegantly when they

00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,590
said the internet is not a system of

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,240
floating se really above societies it is

00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:29,290
embedded in the concrete realities of

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,730
people practices and power and I think

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,560
that we can all agree that this can be

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,390
applied to a lot of what happens on the

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,850
web and in this case I'm applying it to

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:42,970
mobile web access so let's take a look

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:48,460
at the people that are creating this

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:50,800
pillar of power and practices let's take

00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,510
a look at the people using mobile there

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,570
aren't a whole lot of statistics that

00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,730
are really available for the late 90s a

00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,960
lot of the white papers which were

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,760
brought out by the ministry of

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,940
telecommunications aren't really that

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,980
informative about actual statistics

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,560
about web usage but more about the

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,830
concepts of its proliferation so the

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,839
first real hard look from a white paper

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,970
from the ministry of telecommunications

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,370
the japan is from about two thousand

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,430
and back then the average Emma graphic

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:26,100
was aged 20 to 29 and it broke down to

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:30,670
about 44 744 0.7% man man male the and

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:34,389
48.1 % female um fast forward a little

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:38,170
bit to 2011 and it's skewed slightly

00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:40,389
higher um but then again we have to take

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,069
a look at some caveats there I'm sure in

00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,959
Japan mobile web has always been the

00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:46,019
realm of the youth remember that

00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:48,759
benchmark year for the mobile web is

00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:53,379
1997 so these are early adopters have

00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:54,910
grown a little bit older um it's also

00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:57,670
skewed younger in some ways if we

00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:00,879
approach 2015 this is partially because

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,829
of smartphones but also it's because of

00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,870
price normalization on mobile plans

00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:06,430
mainstreaming of increasingly younger

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,620
kids having phones to communicate with

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,329
their parents and the general increasing

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,879
acceptance of mobile phones as a

00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:16,209
necessity of our everyday lives but

00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:18,189
that's said it's also skewed older um as

00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:20,319
we all know Japan has a decreasing

00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:22,449
population and a very highly aging

00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:24,309
population and a lot of these

00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:26,500
domestically produced phones are

00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:28,329
marketed to the elderly with special

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,519
features that make them more useful to

00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:33,040
them so they're more likely to actually

00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,050
be able to use the mobile web or to be

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,089
interested in trying it because of these

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:41,379
phones so in some ways it's also

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:43,449
schooled Oh toad older one of the most

00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:45,339
surprising statistics though is that the

00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,660
fastest growing subset of mobile web

00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:53,649
users is aged five years or younger

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:55,660
that's a little bit shocking um this

00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,129
could possibly be because of smartphones

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,220
it could also be because parents are

00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:02,439
seeing the Moors a utilitarian tool and

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,230
will also come back to this point a

00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:08,350
little bit later so it's precisely these

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,540
ways of using the mobile web which bring

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:16,389
us to the next apex in this mobile

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:18,579
internet trifecta practices before the

00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:21,519
advent of smartphones people were either

00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:26,079
using low-end PHS phones or feature

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:29,470
phones these got a key so the gada k

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,050
were domestically produced smartphone of

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,310
basically produced feature phones

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,620
they're called got a cave because gotta

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,690
is short for a Galapagos and if we think

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,250
about Darwin's theory of evolution the

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,660
animals of the Galapagos Island had

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,820
special features that allowed them to

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,710
survive in their environment and much

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,270
like these animals in the Galapagos

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:51,160
Islands these Galapagos phones ghada k

00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,720
have special features that are extremely

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,320
useful to consumers in the japanese

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,030
market and even today with the huge

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,430
cliff eration of smartphones throughout

00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,990
the world even in japan there's a huge

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,090
passion for god okay in these feature

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,580
phones they still exist they're still

00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:09,100
sold maybe the proportion of purchases

00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,260
compared to the overall amount of mobile

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,180
phone purchases is a little bit smaller

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,980
but people still have a really nostalgic

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,770
passion for it which is something that I

00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,420
find really interesting and they're

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,490
still accessible they still maintain the

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,340
networks that people use with those

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,840
phones to access the web so who knows

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:29,950
then a pinch they might come in really

00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,870
handy still so again let's remember

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,460
we're talking about the mid to late 90s

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,530
when mobile web is really starting to

00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,600
take hold we might still claim to the

00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:40,660
image that Japan was the future manifest

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,340
and that in mobile web sense it was but

00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,040
not in the way that we might have

00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,660
imagined most people didn't have

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,880
internet connections at home like I

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,780
mentioned before so at the start of the

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,760
mobile web this was a really big part of

00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,360
their way of accessing information in

00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:02,260
this new way that was really growing

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,910
after the debut of I mode in 1999 by may

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,770
two thousand one more than 40 million

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,070
Japanese were accessing their internet

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:11,890
via their mobile phones on a daily basis

00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:15,310
this is opposed to about 4 million North

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:18,730
Americans at the same time in 2001 so

00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:20,770
there's a huge difference there and

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,200
again this is about the time that I went

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,910
to Japan so I can really say from my own

00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,640
personal experience that this difference

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:30,430
was massive and it was a bit shocking in

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,900
hindsight and this number nearly doubled

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,640
slightly less than two years later

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,770
according to the Japanese Ministry of

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,270
telecommunications so things weren't

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,120
really slowing down at all people are

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,100
really grabbing on to this in all of

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,790
this high level use led to new

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,870
innovation

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:49,840
some of which had a lasting impact so

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,640
these are some of the things that people

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,590
were using their mobile web for that

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,630
have had a lasting impact on how we use

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,790
our mobile phones today and a lot of

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,150
these came out of the ways that people

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,980
were either looking to use their phones

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,530
wanted to use their phones we're

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,180
naturally adapting their behavior to use

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:10,110
their phones without realizing it um

00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,970
some of these are the male magazine

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,530
which is really like a newsletter but it

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:18,220
was sent directly to your phone usually

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:21,190
as a multimedia male um it's kind of a

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,950
proto blog a lot of people were using

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,050
these as a sort of blogging newsletter

00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,270
but some companies found a marketing

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,430
value in this and they would send it to

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:34,480
their customers as a way to advertise

00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:38,590
their deals or to advertise upcoming

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,440
marketing campaigns this also is sort of

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,450
in the realm of micro blogging as well

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,370
there was a system that was kind of

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,020
similar to twitter but really it wasn't

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,930
even a formal a system it was a way of

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:53,080
sending SMS messages over networks of

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:55,390
multiple receivers so maybe if you had a

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,370
network of 20 or 25 friends you would

00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,700
just enter in all of their numbers as

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:02,470
the recipients of your message much like

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,660
what we have now with what's app or

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,700
telegram with a group message and you

00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,310
could actually include everybody into

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,780
these things and in a really sort of

00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:15,130
primitive way this was a lot like

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:18,580
Twitter we also had RFID mobile system

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:20,860
payments so felica or something called

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,380
oh sigh phuket i sigh foo is the word

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,780
for wallet so you could actually use

00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,600
your phone to log payments for things

00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,040
that would either be added on to your

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,740
mobile phone bill at the end of the

00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,840
month or in later years you were able to

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,990
have it as a separate deduction out of

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,410
your bank account this also helps to

00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:44,550
increase people's attention and

00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:48,340
priorities towards mobile web security

00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:50,380
and eventually this also came to

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,470
influence smartphone development for web

00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,620
security as well streaming video and

00:19:53,470 --> 00:20:00,190
television now we watch you

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,809
tube or we listen to music or we have

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,970
some type of receiver on our phone where

00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:06,550
we can watch movies or what have you we

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,110
don't even think about it twice but back

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,030
then and I even had one of these phones

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,520
you literally had the screen and the

00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:14,559
screen would flip up and you could watch

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,180
TV and it had a little antenna and you

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,770
could watch your TV just like a normal

00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:22,840
TV receiver and that was pretty cool um

00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:25,690
so a lot of these sort of bridge

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,030
technologies that sort of bridged what

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:31,300
we had an analog all crossed to mobile

00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:33,160
they existed they still exist they're

00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:37,179
still sort of looked at with a nostalgic

00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,740
I um and they've brought us into a lot

00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:41,440
of the technology we have now where we

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:45,250
can actually watch videos streaming live

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:49,179
on our smartphones my favorite is QR

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:51,820
codes we've all used them and they're a

00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,890
uniquely Japanese invention and I'm

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,080
going to talk about them in depth I'm in

00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,700
a moment and then finally the mobile

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,250
first approach which is really i think

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,260
the lasting legacy of the japanese

00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,000
mobile culture and advent of mobile web

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,420
and these last two points are ones that

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,809
i'm going to talk about in depth next so

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:12,940
let's take a look at QR codes QR codes

00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:15,309
as i said were a uniquely Japanese

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:18,610
invention they were developed by Denzil

00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:23,050
wave in 1994 and they were originally

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:25,240
developed as a way to tag automobiles

00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,550
during the production process so as they

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,400
went through the factory they could

00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:32,740
track which stage of production each

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,760
individual automobile was at and the

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,690
reason why there was such a

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,210
revolutionary invention was that these

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,309
QR codes were so able to have very dense

00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:47,679
amounts of data and metadata attached to

00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:49,690
them um once they caught up and the in

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,120
the industry was able to use them as a

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,990
regular benchmark people started

00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,850
realizing that they could also use it to

00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:01,000
get information across using what we're

00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:04,510
now new camera phones so this is also

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,810
the late 90s early 2000s so people could

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,910
use their camera phones to take pictures

00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,470
of the QR codes

00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,710
and then you would get something called

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,870
mobile tagging so this is where you

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:20,050
would actually take a photo of a QR code

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,970
off of an actual physical object like a

00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,970
newspaper or an advertisement a

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,800
billboard and take the picture and it

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,440
would bring you away from the physical

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,230
world on to the digital world it's also

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,550
called hard linking and this is a really

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,170
important thing we may sort of take it

00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,820
for granted now because it's an action

00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,760
we do all the time people give us

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,680
business cards with QR codes we see QR

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,990
codes at the bottom of advertisements on

00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,000
flyers for parties we see them

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,370
everywhere we're so used to whipping out

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,050
our phones snapping a quick picture we

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,210
don't think twice about it but back then

00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,770
this was really one of these actions

00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,990
that brought us out of the physical

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:59,370
world and into the digital world in a

00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:02,800
very real way and I think that the

00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,990
semiotic sand the iconography the

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,940
feeling the archetypes of these kinds of

00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,400
actions are really really telling about

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,770
how we've come to relate to the digital

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,600
world so this idea of mobile tagging and

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,250
hard linking and bridging away from the

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,190
physical world into the digital world

00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,990
was a big part of us being able to

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,960
integrate mobile web into our everyday

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:26,680
lives we use them for everything from

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,080
vcards to mobile marketing um after

00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,360
their practical industrial purposes were

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,950
clearly shown people started to realize

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,410
that you could use it to get digital

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,180
business cards to market directly to

00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,070
different demographics because let's

00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,570
face it everybody was looking at their

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,650
phones all the time to get that

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:47,890
information on the web so this began the

00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:49,840
very real integration of mobile web into

00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:54,210
not only Japanese society of the time

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:57,040
but also into our society as a whole um

00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,920
the next lasting legacy is the mobile

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,710
first approach this may seem kind of

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:06,700
like a no-brainer because we are very

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:08,320
mobile first minded these days but then

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,130
again we have to really think about

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,110
where it came from mobile access

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,860
outnumbered pc access by a great amount

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:19,630
so mobile sites were given priority by

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,070
projects management teams by companies

00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:23,680
who were looking to create their digital

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,120
presence so often what would happen

00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:29,140
is that you would get this really

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,110
accessible mobile site okay it loves

00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,940
text and blue linking and lots of tiny

00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,950
image mapping but at the time it was

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,830
extremely accessible but when you went

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,840
to their PC site as I called it it was

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,520
really kind of a dead zombie site it

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,070
really didn't give you much information

00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,570
maybe as a consumer there wasn't much

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:50,350
there you could use maybe it was just

00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:52,060
their address and some information about

00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,530
what the company does but it wasn't

00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,810
anything that consumers could use to

00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,670
actually access their product but when

00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:00,280
you looked at the digital counterpart on

00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,710
mobile there was everything you needed

00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,660
there to find out where to buy it where

00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,690
you could use it how you could use it

00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,430
where you could find support any kinds

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,140
of campaigns or deals that might be

00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:13,680
coming up for that product so there was

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:17,680
a huge gap between this very utilitarian

00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:21,850
mobile site and this very sort of dead

00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,970
almost perfunctory corporate site on PCs

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:26,320
so you could see definitely that the

00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:30,550
priorities lay on the mobile side of

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,290
things again the bias towards text and

00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,990
blue linking just simply made it easy

00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:37,510
for people to see on their mobile phones

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,820
image mapping was also something that

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,560
made it easier for people to see but it

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,230
also turned out that these priorities

00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,870
also sort of started to leak into the pc

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,700
design as well so you saw lots of

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,640
websites that you were accessing with

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,770
your pc we're actually looking almost

00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,160
like two mobile sites if they were ones

00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,720
that had information on them at all

00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,490
there is also the use of the individual

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,610
identification number this is another

00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:05,590
mobile first not so much in innovation

00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:11,040
but the way that they used it in order

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:14,140
to be able to help increase increasing

00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,000
tracking so for example using the iin as

00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,890
a proto cookie from a mobile web access

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,800
because remember there was no like

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:22,690
client-side scripting at that point with

00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,600
those types of phones so they were using

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:28,510
the iin as a way to actually make sort

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,340
of a marker or tag for which individual

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,880
user was using which kinds of services

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,530
or visiting which kind of sites so QR

00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,909
codes mobile first approach I think are

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:39,009
two of the largest

00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:41,919
Agassi's that are left from that era at

00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:43,840
the moment and because of that a lot of

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,649
the industry was able to gain a lot of

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,139
power so let's look at power and the I

00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:53,080
mode business model is the foundation of

00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:56,739
which mobile and digital apps marketing

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,389
is based on as we know it today it's so

00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:59,979
much so that Steve Jobs is said to have

00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:02,320
based the Apple App Store on the

00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:06,489
business model of I mode I find that

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,559
pretty interesting um there's a lot of

00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:12,009
emphasis on development there's a lot of

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:14,769
emphasis on developing new ways to

00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:16,239
deliver content to people of course and

00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:18,279
this set the stage for App Center

00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:21,460
technologies that we have now that are

00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:23,919
mostly found for smartphones so what

00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,929
does this mean well this means that the

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:30,009
mobile web perforated faster than the

00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:33,190
home web this means that mobile first

00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:34,960
was first in Japan and it also set the

00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:39,869
pace and direction for tech and business

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,220
models later on um so now it's later

00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:43,869
what's going on now where does it where

00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,909
is it left to go I think it's a kind of

00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:48,729
interesting time for mobile web in Japan

00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:50,379
at the moment because there's almost two

00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:53,049
different worlds that coexist there's

00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:56,049
this really wonderfully nostalgic

00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:57,759
culture for gotta k and all of these

00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,979
feature phones that are still being

00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,229
produced and still being designed some

00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:04,809
just for designs sake some for novelty

00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:06,849
snake some for nostalgia sake but a lot

00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:09,820
of them are also still very much serving

00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:12,129
a real function for example phones made

00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,629
for the elderly or phones made for small

00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:16,419
children where parents don't want their

00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:18,340
children to have too much access to the

00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:22,029
web for example which is a problem with

00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:24,249
smartphones um so I think that these

00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:26,049
will continue to exist and I think

00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:28,629
they'll continue to serve a purpose it

00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:30,669
in fact for example a lot of times

00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:31,989
during disasters like earthquakes these

00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:34,149
feature phones can sometimes be a

00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:35,919
lifesaver so a lot of people that I know

00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:38,049
still have both their smartphone and

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,769
their feature phone it's a backup and I

00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:43,419
don't think that's a bad idea at all um

00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:44,559
and of course people in Japan are using

00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:47,289
smartphones for all the things we're

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:50,109
using them now social networking chat

00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:50,710
games shopping surfing but now it's

00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:53,710
mostly on

00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,480
our phones I say mostly because people

00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,309
are still using these got okay but then

00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,370
again I don't think those are going to

00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:02,710
go away and i think that the advent of

00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:08,620
smartphones is tipped power but not a

00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:10,120
whole lot um i think that what's going

00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,440
to happen is that there's going to be a

00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:16,179
bit of a flattening of the whole culture

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,740
smartphones are more or less similar I

00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:19,210
mean we have different features we have

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,950
different models what have you but

00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,799
they're all based on very app centric

00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:26,799
technology whereas feature phones aren't

00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:28,360
they're very individual there each model

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,020
is extremely different from the last

00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:34,299
each provider has a different array of

00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,830
ranges of handsets available so I think

00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:38,230
there's a diversity that's available

00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,179
with these feature phones doesn't really

00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,960
play out in the same way in the

00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:46,000
smartphone field um so I think that

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,649
there's probably gonna be a muting of

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,169
the market but I also think that there's

00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:55,590
still potential for a lot of interesting

00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:55,590
maybe more artistic Oh interesting or

00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:03,610
interesting or artistic ways to design

00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:05,500
these feature phones um one thing I want

00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,940
to point out is the statistic I want to

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,620
come back to from before that the

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:13,450
fastest-growing subset of mobile web

00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:16,360
users is age 5 or younger this is also a

00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,250
function of smartphones a lot of parents

00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,110
are using them as educational tools for

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,029
their children they're very image based

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,559
children are able to touch the screens

00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:27,460
and be tactile with them which is very

00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:30,580
important so I'm it maybe it's a bit of

00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:32,919
a skewed statistic because of the way

00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,929
that people use their smartphones and I

00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,970
think that in that sense that's where

00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:38,740
that generation is going to miss out on

00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:43,659
some of the advantages of having these

00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:44,950
feature phones um in that sense

00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:47,500
smartphones were kind of slow to

00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,120
penetrate in Japan and this is an

00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:53,140
interesting case I wanted to focus on a

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,120
little bit with iphone vs android the

00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,490
fun fact about this is that iphone was a

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,929
bit slow to catch on in japan because

00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:01,480
there wasn't really much of a carrier

00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:04,179
choice it wasn't available in japan

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,779
until mid-2008 and Softbank

00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:09,519
which was Vodafone which was Jay phone

00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:12,279
had a three-year monopoly on iPhone and

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,379
iPad retail and contracts before number

00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:16,149
portability became an option in late two

00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:17,619
thousand eleven people were really

00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:18,909
reluctant to change their carriers

00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:20,499
because if they changed their carriers

00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:22,749
they lost their phone number so people

00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:25,059
were very loyal to their carriers and I

00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:27,129
think this also has another factor in

00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:28,809
the sense of all of these feature phones

00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:31,179
and how people would stick with the same

00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:34,809
carrier and choose their future phones

00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:37,570
but in fact since number portability is

00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:39,850
come about Japan is the only market

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,799
where Android has actually had a gain of

00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:44,559
nearly eight percentage points in the

00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:46,749
last two years and this is from a survey

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,190
done by the Kantar Worldpanel and I

00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:51,100
think that's quite interesting as well

00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:53,980
because um this shows again a bit of a

00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,869
tipping into a diversity of app related

00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,820
technologies for smartphones that wasn't

00:31:55,869 --> 00:32:02,769
necessarily there before so it could be

00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:05,309
interesting to see where that goes um so

00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:08,289
what are the takeaways about this well

00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:10,659
early mobile web adoption set the

00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:13,149
priorities for how mobile web was

00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:16,350
developed our mobile first approach and

00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:20,590
how a mobile and non mobile web

00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:23,110
interacted with each other um I drove

00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:25,029
the use of innovations like blogs RFID

00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:27,159
payment systems lay the groundwork for

00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:31,090
streaming video and TV and QR codes and

00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:32,710
more and smartphone proliferation is

00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,779
muted the market so maybe

00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:37,240
compartmentalization is going to give us

00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:39,129
a bit of imagine a but improving the

00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,690
existing issues in web design as it

00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,919
affects desktop oriented sites as

00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:44,619
something that's also gotten better

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,240
there's been more emphasis on

00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:48,490
integration of the two approaches a

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,519
smartphone-based client-side scripting

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:55,210
use happens so we'll see that maybe that

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,460
gap between the more feature phone style

00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:59,249
websites which is still very much a part

00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,320
of Japanese front end today and

00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:04,749
smartphone style apt driven very flat

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,240
design sites will start to close a

00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:08,710
little bit more and I also hope this

00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,690
means that will slowly see an end to

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,980
these zombie sites these sites where

00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,980
it's just sort of a perfunctory

00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:17,109
corporate site for a particular company

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,010
and that will actually move towards more

00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:21,310
of the Western

00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,870
style diversity of different web sites

00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:25,090
and many sites that are available to

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:28,300
educate the consumer about products or

00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:30,180
services and so yeah I think that's

00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:34,210
where the future's going to take us um

00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:36,700
oh I want to say thank you to everybody

00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:40,870
who came today and there's a list of

00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:43,120
people here i want to thank um yeah and

00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:48,640
i hope that you can see the legacy of

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:50,140
japanese web mobile um used when you

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,880
look at your smartphone when you use

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,380
your apps and that maybe hopefully

00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,910
someday you'll work on a project that

00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,260
helps to bridge this gap a little bit

00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,260
more thank you

00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,400
