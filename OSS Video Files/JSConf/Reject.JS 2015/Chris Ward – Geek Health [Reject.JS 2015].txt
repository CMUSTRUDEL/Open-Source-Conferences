# Geek Health

We keep up to date with the latest developments in technologies and tools. We make sure to post pull requests to fix bugs we found in projects. We offer helpful advice in forums to people with coding questions. We propose talks for meetups and conferences to provide insight and inspiration.

All this on top of our day job.

When in the midst of all this activity do we stop to think about our mental or physical health?

The mental stress of sustained periods of high intellectual activity is draining and exhausting. The Physical impact of having such a sedentary job is becoming increasingly recognised. And all those caffeinated and sugar filled drinks we consume to keep going? Yeah, they’re not that good for us either.

In this presentation I will look at quick tips to keep ourselves a little healthier whilst we do what we love. I’m not talking gruelling evenings huffing and puffing at the gym, but manageable and easy advice to whip you into shape.

ah

00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:14,509
reject okay so I'm missing my notes and

00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:19,640
it's the first time I've ever done this

00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:23,630
talk this could be interesting so first

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,670
and foremost I'm no I'm no expert on

00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,210
health or fitness or anything like that

00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,710
yeah I'm thin but that's not everything

00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,699
and that's probably more luck than

00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:37,610
anything else but after many years being

00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:39,979
a working development it's just a topic

00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,199
that I've wanted to help people with and

00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:45,680
to be honest with you in Germany

00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:47,930
probably far better than developers I've

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,470
met in other countries so not all of

00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:58,610
this will apply but some of it hopefully

00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:00,949
so every day as a developer we're

00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,860
generally checking news keeping up to

00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:06,830
date with news and updates that's

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:12,400
happening in in the areas were working

00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:16,850
in we're keeping an eye on issues and

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,800
handling them and replying to them we're

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,960
taking care of pull requests and

00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,810
commenting and interacting with people

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,480
on those we may be helping out on things

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,820
like stackoverflow and other forums to

00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,810
help other developers who are learning

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,850
and having problems we may be attending

00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,909
and speaking at meetups and other events

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:43,909
and maybe we're writing proposals and

00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:47,150
presenting at conferences as well this

00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:50,530
is a lot of flexible of time and all of

00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:53,510
this is also on top of a day job and

00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,940
maybe for some people are family as well

00:01:53,510 --> 00:02:00,620
this is quite a commitment quite a lot

00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:02,299
of commitment here and a lot of people

00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,549
outside the development community will

00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:06,770
say things like don't you'll get paid

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,049
really well don't you will get amazing

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,520
benefits and work in really cool offices

00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:18,050
and spend all day not really working

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:21,680
well this is a sometimes true

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:25,400
yes and not for everybody this only

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:30,010
tends to be some companies not all

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,920
companies and all developers and still

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:40,910
health is important you only get one try

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:44,030
at it within reason depending on beliefs

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:52,040
and luck and a combination of the two

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:54,200
maybe and whilst life is worth living in

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,810
the moment sometimes the moment can be

00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:01,790
longer and more enjoyable if you're in

00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:04,670
good health whilst doing it so let's

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,440
have a look at some issues and I have

00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,000
some facts and figures in my notes that

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,020
I can't currently see so I may have to

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,610
do a bit of really annoying switching

00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,720
back with the forwards because when

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,390
giving facts and figures you want to

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,160
give the rightfax of figures so this

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:21,620
might be slightly annoying but we'll see

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:28,160
what happens so typical developer

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:32,450
environment here and another one and

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,940
another one apart from this last picture

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,170
where there's someone breaking my rules

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,370
but they're the best pictures I could

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:44,900
find everyone's sitting down as are most

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:48,770
of you now as well this isn't new this

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,360
debate and it will sort of up and down

00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,420
whether it really is or it really isn't

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:57,080
and but I think now most people are in

00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,590
fairly strong agreement that it is if we

00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,090
all do it way too much and if you want

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,590
to read a little bit more detail on this

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,540
it's a discussion it was mainly had a

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,540
couple of years ago there's this oops no

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,550
not that that article on the Washington

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,459
Post that has a really graphic as well

00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,160
but I've picked some facts here from the

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,840
NHS they seemed as the British National

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,100
Health Service seem to be better than

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,970
picking them from an article or some

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:29,240
untrusted blog NHS does seem vaguely

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:31,670
more trustworthy so there's lots of

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:35,230
problems we're sitting down too much

00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:38,480
and we are all doing it way too much and

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:41,060
this isn't common or unique to

00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,220
development community of course all jobs

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,940
now or most jobs now a sedentary and

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,530
involve using computers and trying to do

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,280
anything else apart from sit down all

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,710
day is quite difficult and of course

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,420
we're always ahead of most and on the

00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,740
cutting edge in the development

00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,350
community so we've come up with ideas

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,390
like standing desks and actually I want

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,030
to point out in most i've picked it in

00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:08,000
some of these pictures intentionally

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:11,150
because so this person has a standing

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,820
desk but there is a stool behind and

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:18,680
he's actually standing all day is also

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:21,620
not very good for you so um the secret

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,180
is actually variety really a bit of

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,370
sitting a bit of standing a bit of

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,670
moving maybe sitting in a few different

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:31,130
places giving your body a surprise and

00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,200
something new experiences on a regular

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,030
basis is actually possibly the best

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,490
thing to do and here's some other

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,830
examples so in this picture we have some

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,300
normal desks and we have some standing

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,310
desk towards the back and these are

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,370
becoming more and more common in all

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,810
workplaces which is really good and

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:51,800
here's another good example of a sort of

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,240
similar mixed office the strange thing

00:05:51,800 --> 00:06:00,800
is though it's more of a cultural thing

00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:03,860
in that I found I go to events quite

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,660
often and I like to stand up I've been

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,670
sat down all day and you stand up at the

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,680
back and people are really awkward about

00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,020
it they always think you're

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,840
uncomfortable or there's not enough

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,120
chairs or say it's a strange thing that

00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,130
we all know that it's bad for us and yet

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,290
when you try to not do it people are

00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:25,940
really uncomfortable about it so it's a

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,500
the cultural shift has changed in that

00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,040
we know we should do it so much but it's

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,770
still seen as an odd thing to do and

00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,360
which is strange and yeah I still

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,980
challenge whether you can get as much

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,080
done standing up or sitting down it's

00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,660
slightly harder and you also notice as

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,790
we'll come to in a minute it's hard to

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,910
get posture right as well

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,950
so it's a tough one but we're it's it's

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,810
something that more people are open to

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:59,510
investigating okay let's get a bit more

00:06:50,810 --> 00:07:01,850
extreme walking disks this is it's

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,290
actually become a popular as well less

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,300
so in Europe and these are

00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,620
professionally available ones I've never

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,570
been to an office like this this is

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,200
quite incredible and these are very

00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:16,000
expensive and you can get some more DIY

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,410
options like this and there's plenty of

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,600
tutorials on this and this is actually a

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:24,020
friend of mine in Croatia this is one he

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,240
has and I know a guy in Friedrichs rain

00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,100
who's done something very similar and as

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,230
again you can see you can actually add a

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,050
chair to it and both the people i know

00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,570
who do this are incredibly thin and look

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:40,220
like rakes I don't know if that's good

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:43,130
or bad but but so but again variety is

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,690
kind of the spice of life as we say and

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:49,400
there's many ways and things to try now

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:52,100
so posture we already had a quick look

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,310
at that this is a very traditional sort

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,720
of look at bad posture and coding

00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,840
especially is one of those activities

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,960
you sit there you're concentrating on

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,940
something and in four hours later you

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,170
realize you've been SAT like this not

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,110
quite like this because I'm standing up

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,000
but for about four hours with your back

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,790
like that and your arms like that and

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,670
you suddenly think Oh God what about

00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:19,280
done to myself and it's very hard to not

00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,380
to it's very hard to avoid these habits

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,350
sometimes and we all know that we should

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,460
sit straight relax muscles arm 90

00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,230
degrees and things like that but when

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,460
you're concentrating it's quite

00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,880
difficult to concentrate on anything

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:37,460
else and I have a more amusing picture

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:40,610
there but and again posture is something

00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,700
that isn't new there's plenty of advice

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,740
out there on things to try and

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:49,340
especially in Czech workspaces I think

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,290
we tend to get better setups but often

00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,880
there's also a conscious decision for

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,190
you to try and sit better as well and

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,000
again bad posture can

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:03,980
arm things like blood flow back problems

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,370
of course and as you get older it gets

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,130
worse and I work on computers I ride a

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,990
bike I used to play guitar none of those

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,600
are good for your posture at all because

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:19,760
you always like that the whole time so

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:23,810
try it's hard work but try okay exercise

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,380
now I don't go to a gym I personally

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,120
think Jim's are just a an excuse for to

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,880
get money out of you can get exercise in

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,660
other ways as well but and this is some

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:40,280
advice that I want to to give simple

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:42,290
simple things you can try yeah this is

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,500
probably the when you try to find

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,670
pictures about exercise you end up

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,460
finding there's lots of pictures of

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,380
unrealistic looking people and looking

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,080
very happy with themselves this is about

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:58,970
the best I could most realistic picture

00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,710
I could find about exercise and again

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:04,280
I'm missing my facts and figures

00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:06,890
unfortunately but we all know that a

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,590
lack of exercise mixed with sedentary

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:14,090
lifestyles can cause weight gain blood

00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:18,650
flow problems heart problems leg issues

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:20,030
back issues etc etc and not proposing

00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,440
anything particularly difficult here we

00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,510
have some very simple solutions of

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,430
things just to get some exercise take a

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,250
short walk every hour also gives you a

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,260
good screen break I think opinion on

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,720
whether looking at screens all day long

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,700
is bad for our eyes has changed somewhat

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,460
but certainly it's good to get up from

00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,110
your desk for reasons we've already seen

00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,150
walking meetings I don't know about you

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,940
but I'm actually a my most inspired when

00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,170
I'm walking and if I could well I can

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,580
walk and work we've already looked at

00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:51,589
that but but if I could walk more during

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,140
my day I think I would have a lot better

00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:56,870
ideas the blood gets pumping and you get

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,150
some amazing ideas so we have stand-ups

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,940
what about walkouts now that sounds a

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:04,100
bit too extreme but do some other ideas

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,990
stand up every hour there we go that's

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,940
another one we know the Apple watch is a

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,810
bit enthusiastic about telling us to do

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,940
that but you get the idea

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,920
take the stairs again this is actually

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,230
far more regular in in Germany than

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,430
other countries I've lived in and in

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,720
fact half the time there's not even the

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:25,000
lift so you have no excuse and walk or

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,110
ride to work if possible in fact even if

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,100
you get public transport you're

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,140
generally getting more exercise and

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,960
driving just by virtue of walking two

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,490
stops usually standing up walking from a

00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,940
stop to your office and things like that

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,350
and of course if you work from home you

00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:43,270
have to try even harder with some of

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:45,310
these things easy running high impact

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,870
running if you're out of shape is

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,690
probably going to do you more harm than

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,300
good but even ten minutes a day is

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:55,630
better than nothing or brisk walk if

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,190
you're like swimming swimming is not

00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,020
only good for your fitness is also good

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,640
for lung capacity if you have problems

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,350
like asthma and things like that you

00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,300
don't have to if you're a little bit

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,980
overweight or you have bad feet it's

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,140
also good because you're not relying on

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:12,610
them so something like swimming is very

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:14,500
good mental health now this is probably

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:19,390
one that actually gets over looks more

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:23,020
because it's harder to see so it's sort

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,160
of undecided whether whilst the brain is

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,200
one of the actually one of the biggest

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,810
and any of your friends who have fitness

00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,280
fans will try and tell you otherwise the

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,950
brain is actually the biggest consumer

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,900
of energy in your body it consumes

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,970
twenty percent of the energy that you

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,560
bring into your body which considering

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,040
how much space it takes up in your body

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,740
is quite amazing it's unproven as of now

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:49,360
whether if you do more intellectual

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:51,580
activity you require more energy it's

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,190
sort of some reports say yes and some

00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,350
say no it's sort of one that is

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:59,339
currently being looked at quite a lot

00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:03,130
but those periods of constant focus

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:04,930
those periods of constantly thinking put

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,490
strain on you in other ways whether or

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,890
not it's actually consuming more energy

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:15,339
or not as I say is controversial but

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:17,290
you're still the focus is tiring this is

00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:18,790
not that it's not the best

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,459
representation of what I was looking for

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,339
but this is talking about the isolation

00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:26,170
of Technology and

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:28,120
for a lot of us in this room who will

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,089
probably picked on at school and had a

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,689
horrible time and if you were a child of

00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:37,300
the 80s splash early 90s there was no

00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:39,100
real escape from that world now there's

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,730
an escape you can find people who are

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:46,749
like you anywhere in the world and it's

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:48,129
it's been empowering for many but it

00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:50,800
also cuts you off from the world around

00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:53,649
you and this especially if you work from

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,589
home or work in distributed teams is is

00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:59,079
it is something to be conscious of and I

00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:00,790
find myself getting less or more

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:02,110
oblivious to what's going on around me

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,610
and the feelings of people around me

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,439
sometimes and we're all doing it more

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,089
and if you've noticed in the past 10

00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:10,029
years no one looks where they're going

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:12,600
anymore because we're so used to being

00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:16,089
in our own world and that can lead to

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:19,360
side effects as well so here's some

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:23,709
ideas to try to help with that isolation

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,329
of working with lots of working with

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,079
technology but also that mental strain

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:30,309
and we'll come to some of the

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,449
consequences of that mental strain in a

00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:33,399
minute but here's some things to try to

00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:35,579
prevent getting it in the first place go

00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:38,589
for a walk you could tell I like walks

00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:41,850
it's good for you speak to someone you

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:44,679
don't work with and whether that be in

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:48,429
your company or outside of the company

00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:50,470
speak to the person you get your coffee

00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,089
from speak to someone random on the

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,129
street it'll probably surprised the hell

00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:56,709
out of them but they'll make their day

00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:59,980
as well hopefully the petty where the

00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:04,059
conversation goes speak to a stranger

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,559
yeah for social actions this is this is

00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:08,949
one that's possibly harder for us

00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:11,079
sometimes it's easy to retreat into your

00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,990
own world and we've already done I find

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:16,420
myself doing that i find myself avoiding

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,009
conflicts because i don't really why

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,069
would i want to go into them but

00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:23,740
sometimes the outcome can be far better

00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:26,589
than you expect and actually what you

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,949
were worried about resolves itself in a

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:31,209
more positive way anyway so try to force

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,100
yourself into a difficult situation

00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:35,170
you're trying to avoid on a reasonably

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,130
regular basis is also good for your

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:41,950
brain as well in things like

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:43,450
elasticity in your brain attend events I

00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,030
don't really have to tell that to anyone

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,660
here you're all under vent so but to the

00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:52,630
people out there attended event

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,010
volunteer be it in a related field or

00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,390
unrelated field is a great way of

00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,610
getting out of your mental space

00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,170
realizing sometimes depending where

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,300
you're volunteering that the problems

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,100
you think you have are not as big as

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,190
problems other people have as well and

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:11,560
it's a great invigorate ER for your

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:13,510
mental health take a nap I don't know

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,120
why the northern hemisphere or northern

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,670
countries are so obsessed with starting

00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,680
work at a particular time taking a short

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,720
break finishing a particular time and

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,480
then running away as soon as possible a

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,180
lot of other countries especially the

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,190
warmer countries will take siestas naps

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,880
whatever you want to call it and there's

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,880
been many exam

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:51,080
I have been ignoring that for quite a

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:52,940
while it's probably laughing later I'm

00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,680
not gonna do live demo is a bad enough

00:16:52,940 --> 00:17:00,950
let alone live update and it's been well

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,250
proven that many people believed in

00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,050
taking short naps I we know famous

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,180
historical examples like Napoleon and

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:11,780
Churchill I they're probably less

00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,640
realistic people to look at but um I

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,500
used to work especially people from

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,430
countries like China and Japan are

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,839
amazing at just napping and if you've

00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,750
ever been to any of those countries

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,820
you'll see people just having a nap and

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,050
I used to work with a guy in back in

00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,640
Melbourne in Australia who would after

00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:31,640
lunch with the city's desk take a nap

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,220
and it's actually great view I can't do

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,770
it personally but it's great for your

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,470
brain it really invigorates you and

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:42,200
again a lot of these bits of advice I'm

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,940
trying to give are reliant on being in a

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,010
workplace that will encourage and allow

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,510
you to do these things and not think oh

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,990
my god they're sleeping on the job who

00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:54,400
is this idiot but yeah but try it try

00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:59,900
some of these things meditation again I

00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,670
I like kind of being uptight so I I

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,030
don't find meditation a very easy thing

00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:07,610
to do but I keep trying and I know it's

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,440
good for me but I'm not saying I do

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:19,250
everything all these lists as I said

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:23,240
earlier this is alluding to again the

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:25,570
impact on your eyes of working late in

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,820
the dark just before you go to bed is

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:31,970
sort of contentious but certainly we're

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,010
aware that being switched on wherever we

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,220
consider that just mental activity or

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,810
literally switched on with the device

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:42,250
you should try to have about an hour

00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:46,220
before you go to sleep switched off and

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:49,310
and again something like a kindle for

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,010
reading still is shown to not be as good

00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:54,050
as just reading a book and I understand

00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,640
we appreciate I travel a lot I

00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,310
completely appreciate the convenience of

00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,710
things like digital books but give it a

00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:03,470
go try it listen to some music or

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,990
something like that sleep is by far one

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:08,930
of the most important things to get

00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,820
right without good sleep it affects

00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:16,160
pretty much all the other things we've

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:17,660
talked about now there we go I could see

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,570
why I doubt to what's coming next so

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:25,220
yeah all these things sleep helps so ah

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:28,010
even a little bit of strangely it sounds

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,430
like a contradiction but doing some

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,900
exercise before sleep can also help and

00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:37,760
he's again were from the NHS MIT plus

00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:39,520
many others here's an interesting one

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,320
I've kind of gone off on a slight

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,600
tangent in terms of mental health saying

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,730
no learning to say no knowing your

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,650
limits knowing your boundaries it's

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,900
often causes lots of the mental health

00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:53,870
in the first place especially in our

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,000
field this is a favorite phrase of a

00:19:53,870 --> 00:20:01,070
friend of mine I'll leave it up to you

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,560
to fill in the blanks and having clear

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,440
conversations and making sure we're not

00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,720
assuming anything about anything can be

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,940
a good source of clearing up mental

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,270
stress in the long run if you don't have

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,640
time for a task in planning stand-ups

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,140
things like that say so I personally

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,820
feel like it's better to under-promise

00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,800
and over-deliver than the other way

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:25,040
around if you don't understand something

00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:28,250
ask no harm in it if you're

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,780
uncomfortable say so and we we read

00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,420
event has a code of conduct that this

00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:35,690
can also minimum or micro level we have

00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:40,430
a problem say so don't let things sit

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:43,460
and bubble under the surface now we come

00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:45,260
to diet because often when we're

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,180
stressed when we have mental health when

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:51,170
we're feeling down we overcompensate

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:55,250
with bad often eating drinking other

00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:57,770
things I really wanted to come up here

00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,170
and say Club Marta is bad for you but

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:02,660
actually isn't I was quite disappointed

00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:04,190
it's the caffeine is about the same as a

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,630
cup of coffee or the sugar is really low

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,410
so keep drinking

00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:14,150
it's okay just not too many so we'll

00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:16,880
leave that one alone pizza how many

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:19,130
events do we go to where the catering is

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,930
pizza and pizza actually went down well

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,120
with certain ingredients and not too

00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:25,700
much cheese not too much salt isn't too

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,800
bad but we can't guarantee that that's

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,960
what we're getting so you know

00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,020
moderation I like a slice of pizza but

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,940
moderation or suggest to meetup

00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:38,570
organizers they try something else more

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:45,530
of that later okay I thought this would

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:47,990
make you love it really exists so whilst

00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:52,190
Marte is not too bad other energy drinks

00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:54,590
are terrible Coca Cola Cola actually pre

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,840
bad full of sugar full of all sorts of

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,240
stuff and a lot of the labeling on them

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,470
is misleading as well often the

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,250
ingredients you don't even what they are

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:07,100
so again in moderation everything in

00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:12,380
moderation is ok but try not to have too

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:13,880
many mottos ok the alcohol I don't

00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,580
really have to say much about the

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,330
negatives of alcohol we all know where

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:23,270
it can lead to when gone too far but we

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,950
also know that in our space with meetups

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,810
and certain offices is alcohol

00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:30,110
everywhere and especially in Germany

00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:31,490
it's cheap it's freely available Germans

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,680
are actually pretty good with alcohol

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,360
consumption comparison to I'm half

00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,440
English half australian exposition I

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,150
cannot talk about alcohol but it's

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,670
always available and I love and often

00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:46,040
for free where we are where we work so

00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:49,240
you know be sensible now I'm going to do

00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,240
a video next let's hope this works

00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:10,730
no see no okay all right this was if

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,140
anyone could recognize from this fuzzy

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:18,590
image the IT crowd and where Jen takes

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,660
up smoking and in most countries in

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:24,230
Western world there are public smoking

00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:32,480
bans and smoking now feels like you're

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:40,760
maligned Oh anyway so the likening isn't

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:45,260
now feeling like no okay too much beer

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,520
give the valium right I think it could

00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:51,050
be like this most of time so I'll just

00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,760
talk through it now smoking in most

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,930
Western countries is sort of felt like

00:23:52,760 --> 00:24:00,440
you're an outcast in Germany not so much

00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:02,930
but again we also know that smoking is

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,920
bad for us we don't have to you don't

00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:10,610
mean me to tell you that but moderation

00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,740
again if you're stressed you might be

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,420
smoking more try to solve the problems

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,590
of stress instead of just smoking more I

00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:20,630
guess so here some things to try intact

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,520
instead of unhealthy snacks fruit in

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,280
moderation this event has fruit I see

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,920
lots of other events have fruit is great

00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,420
nuts nuts could be can be fatty and

00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,950
maybe have too much energy so again in

00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,800
moderation especially certain sorts of

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:36,160
nuts and almonds almonds are terrible

00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,090
for the environment so avoid those

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,920
especially they come from California

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:43,970
which is a place we're all very familiar

00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,740
with and being tech people and they use

00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,200
a lot of water in California is having

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,690
one of the worst droughts ever so avoid

00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,160
almonds if you can for other reasons

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,320
water water is actually quite a good

00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,590
appetite suppressant if you're hungry so

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,870
smoking but see previous slide healthy

00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,570
snacks there's some solutions to this

00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,990
and I'm going to forward you shortly to

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:08,180
someone who's far better expert on this

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,600
cook together often when you go out and

00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,550
eat

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,620
take away restaurants are often over

00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:19,250
salting seasoning putting extra fats et

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:21,710
cetera et cetera food was because really

00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,810
why so cooking together at work is not

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,970
only a good activity again to introduce

00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,530
that Mentos mental health positives but

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,390
also you're controlling what's going in

00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:33,380
your food and you knowing what you're

00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:36,620
eating going for a walk it's a good

00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:44,030
distraction if you're hungry and I like

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:48,370
walking so um thanks very much now

00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:52,220
there's something you know second oh

00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:56,600
that's right yeah and that was very

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:58,040
corny wasn't it is so I have been to

00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,300
developer for quite a long time but at

00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,970
the moment actually work in developer

00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:05,480
relations which is sort of why I come

00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:13,040
into touch with a lot of um developers

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:14,440
and as part of that one thing I'm going

00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,190
to be doing in the future is

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:21,470
collaborating with my my wife who in

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:23,510
Melbourne was a award-winning cooking

00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,950
teacher and she's still doing some of

00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,260
that here but we're actually going to

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,290
try running between the two of us as

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,090
part of other things healthy snacks and

00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:35,120
catering for events take evades the

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:37,040
technate ups and things like that so we

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,350
have some healthy snacks available and I

00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,850
can see at the back are they in the in

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,150
the tent yeah in the tent out the back

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:47,840
there's not enough for all of you and

00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:51,040
you only have 10 minutes so go seriously

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,040
go now quick

00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:57,309
