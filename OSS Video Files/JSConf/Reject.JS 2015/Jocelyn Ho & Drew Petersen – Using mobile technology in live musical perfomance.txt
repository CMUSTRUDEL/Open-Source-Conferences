# Everyone is a rockstar – Using mobile technology in live musical performance

Music is often thought of as a purely auditory experience. But scientific research (and any fan of concerts!) has shown that our senses are interconnected: they intermingle to create a full-bodied moment.

To explore the intersection between our senses, we created a new musical experience: the performer at her (tiny and portable) piano extends her gestures to the audience, triggering (via a Kinect) sounds and tones through the speakers of their mobile phones. The audience also becomes an involved performer, by augmenting and distorting the sounds with their own movements.

During this talk, we’ll break through the fourth wall of performance and demonstrate how this musical experience was technically accomplished via JS / Web Audio / your ears, as well as invoke the piece itself in a meta experience with the audience (as long as the wifi cooperates!).

reject hello everyone thanks for coming

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,980
to our talk we're going to talk about

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,039
today and experience experimental

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,859
performance experience one that involves

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,880
not only the perform on stage but also

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:36,600
you as an actively participating ad hoc

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:41,239
performers as well so a little bit about

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:45,510
us first I'm Jocelyn I'm a classical

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:48,180
pianist and composer and here is my

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,940
collaborator I'm drew drew peterson i'm

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,270
a software engineer javascript engineer

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,539
at spotify all right so I was really

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:02,039
excited about Mouse's talk because music

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:05,460
is really a empathic activity between

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,729
the audience and the performer and today

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,580
we're going to do this extend this by

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:15,210
making your mobile phones into makeshift

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,450
instruments all right so a little bit

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,479
about the background i'm running a

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,619
year-long project called synesthesia

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,170
playground a project that is

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,530
interdisciplinary and collaborative

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,920
involving myself for other composers a

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:36,320
visual artist and drew here I'll star

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,150
software developer this project is

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,460
commissioning five multimedia works for

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,000
piano which I'll take on to the next

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,310
year the goal of this project is to make

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,240
the classical music experience

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:54,030
accessible dare I say transform the

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,159
classical music experience even to

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,390
something that is interactive fun

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,009
relatable and appealing to all audiences

00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:08,940
with mobile phones and that's everybody

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:13,840
basically so what is this word here this

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,670
long word synesthesia our five senses

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,170
though we think of them as separate

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:24,129
turns out not to be so distinct when we

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:29,290
hear sounds we often think of space like

00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:37,330
high-end no sounds we think of colors

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:45,940
like bright Oh dull or temperature like

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:49,150
warm and I see so some people feel this

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,250
intermixing of the senses more acutely

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:56,110
than others and this neurological

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:58,209
phenomenon is called synesthesia so for

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,400
instance synesthetes people with

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,860
synesthesia might see sounds very

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,959
vividly see colors associated with

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,840
specific harmonies or pictures and so on

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,829
or have some kind of tactile experience

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,890
when they see colors on here sounds so

00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:18,250
synesthesia inspires an altogether new

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:22,569
way of listening to music through all

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:24,519
the senses of our bodies so the goal of

00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,040
synesthesia playground is to get at this

00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:29,980
bodily experience appealing to sound

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,319
through other senses now throughout

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,340
Western historical thought music has

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:40,000
been debated as a pure abstract

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,970
idealized form of art however you cannot

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,040
only listen to music in your mind the

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,989
split between mind and body is just an

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,560
artificial divide that takes away from

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:54,930
the fullness of this bodily visceral

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,169
experience in fact the 20th century a

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,000
phenomenologist maurice merleau-ponty

00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:04,169
here goes even a step further and

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,639
associate every knowledge that we have

00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:09,900
every experience we have in this world

00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:13,569
is first and foremost through our body

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,489
no thought no emotion if ever away from

00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:19,510
the bodily knowledge that you have

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:22,120
acquired throughout years of living so

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,789
synesthesia playground aims to celebrate

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,570
this bodily experience bringing music

00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:31,800
music from the abstract and the head

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:34,030
to this very basic full human experience

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,889
alright so that's the context of

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,199
synesthesia playground this year-long

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,370
project the piece we're discussing today

00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:44,080
is one of the five commissioned works

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,930
while the other works deal with the

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,210
bodily experience of an individual this

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,330
piece we're talking about today involves

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:56,770
the collective experience of

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,210
interconnected communal bodies now music

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,490
has always been something that humans

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,970
have done collectively as a form of

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,370
cultural sharing its practiced as a type

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,620
of communal bonding since the beginnings

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,590
of the ages whether it be in ceremonies

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,880
in churches and late night jam sessions

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:19,270
and so on for this piece our vision is

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,789
this type of communal music making we

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,210
want to create a collective structured

00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:27,490
improvisation involving a flexible

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:31,330
amount of people with one guiding

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:34,199
improviser me at the front we aim to

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,510
transform the classical piano concert

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,940
into a collaborative bonding musical

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:44,680
experience with instruments relevant to

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:46,690
the 21st century our mobile phones so we

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,470
decided to use mobile gestural

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,539
technologies both in terms of screen and

00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,240
a seller ometer detected gestures

00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:58,590
because it appeals immediately to the

00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,419
bodily sense of touch and off movement

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:06,750
now what could a particular gesture

00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:13,509
sound like like a shake or a flash or a

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:19,630
slow scratch what could a certain touch

00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:21,940
like tickling or tapping sounds like now

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,310
in addition the Kinect is going to be

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,130
used to detect the pianists movements

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:30,970
they cannot augment the piano by so

00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:32,680
using gestures in the air with sounds so

00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,259
for instance one of the gestures I use

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,810
is this very dramatic arm gesture and

00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:41,370
its associated with a drastic change in

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,370
the pace of the music

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,710
alright so I'm the pianist at the front

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,720
and the audience somehow interacts with

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,390
me and you know amongst themselves as

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,340
well so now we've got a framework let's

00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:59,120
talk a little bit about the content of

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:01,640
the piece visit the set up we have here

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,810
actually opens up a lot of opportunities

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:08,900
as well as questions now what is the

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,640
relationship between the pianist and the

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,550
audience what's the relationship between

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:17,810
the audience members from one to the

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:20,810
other more practical question is how do

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,330
I juggle interactivity with kind of

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,660
performative satisfaction or

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:29,570
performative sportsmanship now more

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:33,320
philosophically is the issue of game

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:35,630
versus performance so game is about you

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,640
know involvement where everyone's

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,800
participating doing stuff and

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,100
performance involves kind of

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,680
spectatorship so is it still a

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:50,060
performance if everyone is a player and

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:53,600
there are no spectators or are the game

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,910
players also spectating so on this

00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,620
spectrum how much of the piece is

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:02,060
actually a performance and how much of

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:05,330
it is a game so with this new kind of

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,729
performance / game consists of in place

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,860
I've decided to exploit this very

00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:12,250
interactive environment by coming up

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:17,930
with a piece about social dynamics

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:21,080
psychology and social behavior so think

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:25,100
of a room of people at a party like Ren

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,919
was boat party how do people relate to

00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:31,250
each other how do people act in response

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,890
to what they hear do you chime in when

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:37,039
people talk or do you fill in silences

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:39,169
when people don't talk in some

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,169
situations people choose to talk over

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,120
one another well some people just you

00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:47,630
know choose to reflect back or imitate

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,700
what they hear now self-consciousness is

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:53,270
something we are all familiar with at a

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,810
party what do people do in response to

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:58,040
how con

00:08:53,810 --> 00:09:00,290
sures of of themselves and in the

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,440
presence of an influential individual is

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:07,190
the possibility of just mindless echoing

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,339
or emulation so the piece that I've

00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:12,640
wrote I've written heightens this bodily

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:15,950
experience of these social interactions

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,640
how does it feel to be hesitant and

00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:22,970
uncertain anxious self-conscious elf

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:26,380
conscious or confident so I've turned

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:29,450
these kind of social behaviors and

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,720
consciousness into sound into a piece of

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:35,330
music alright so back to the concert

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,970
hall now we have a room full of people

00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,880
each with their phones so I've split up

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:44,750
the audience into four quadrants now for

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:48,260
each quadrant or group green red blue

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:51,490
and yellow I devised game like rules for

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:54,589
gesturing with the phones these rules

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,510
explore how people act and listen to

00:09:54,589 --> 00:10:02,480
each other in different social dynamics

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:04,640
so here is an example of one of them so

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,030
in this one the audience is asked to be

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,870
hyper aware of their own bodies like be

00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:13,880
very aware of swallowing your saliva so

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,500
which is which is a bodily experience of

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,990
being self-conscious being hyper aware

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,980
of what you're doing which usually is

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,750
automatic so these rules change as the

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,880
piece is played as the soundscape

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,740
changes the audience is also given

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,380
different rules to adapt to the

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,540
environment all right and I'm talking so

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,720
let's hear some excerpts of the preview

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:39,860
performance we had last week at spectrum

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,310
NYC an experimental music venue alright

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,160
so the piece

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,390
is divided into three sections so this

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,910
is the first section which you're

00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:55,029
hearing now so this section is called

00:10:51,910 --> 00:11:02,670
metals you can hear a lot of metallic

00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:06,010
down inside the piano stuff you can see

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:09,160
very dark but some some of the people

00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:12,570
are raising their phones to admit sound

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,570
from the mobile phones

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:27,450
the rules of the mobile phones that you

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:30,149
said they have all right so all right so

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:35,640
this is section 2 that was the Kinect

00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:40,050
gesture to go into section 2 section 2

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:43,470
is called underwater and the audience is

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:45,540
compelled to be self-conscious or hyper

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:50,850
work themselves following the rules on

00:11:45,540 --> 00:12:00,089
their phones all right so this is

00:11:50,850 --> 00:12:01,790
another example so this is the gesture

00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:06,820
going from

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,820
the underwater section 2 section 3

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,880
alright so that's the content and the

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:37,330
kind of lots of it behind the piece but

00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:40,240
how did we do it yes so let's find out

00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:42,370
the answer in case you're wondering is

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,550
just a lot of JavaScript just JavaScript

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:48,100
all over the place here's the setup you

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,180
saw a little exercise before I'm going

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,040
to be moving pretty quickly because

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,810
there's a live demo so forgive me if I'm

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,570
speeding but this is actually my brother

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,660
and joseline at the piano up at the top

00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,400
in the middle there's a little like I

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,080
looking thing like Curiosity rover at

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,030
that's the Kinect looking at Jocelyn and

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,740
my brothers on the computer controlling

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,480
the Kinect so there were a few

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,130
challenges with this thing and it's a

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,780
challenge to get any sort of phones to

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,790
kind of coordinate this you know this

00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,680
many phones we had about 30 people which

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,180
was a great turnout we're going to have

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,820
even more today so hopefully it works

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,290
we'll see what happens but I started

00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,450
writing my own thing and then turns out

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,850
Oh someone already wrote a thing that

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:27,070
does this exactly it's a server called

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,020
rhizome and you should all check it out

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,430
it's amazing it's basically just an

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,160
automatic messaging service with

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,920
supports for web sockets and osc which

00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,370
is a sound protocol it does things like

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,470
reconnect automatically and also just

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,480
does some pub/sub stuff so here's how

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,400
like a typical real-time server app

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,590
might work you've got the client like a

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,300
phone and some server and the client

00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,680
says like hey what's going on the server

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,780
is like there's what's going on sends it

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,790
back and then also just like sending

00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,970
back updates to the client because the

00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,320
server knows everything about the state

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,140
and in this case the server would know

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,830
everything about the performance and

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,790
that kind of looks like this

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:08,730
topologically in the what we did for

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,990
this performance is used instead a

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,000
distributed messaging server app which

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,700
of course still has a centralized server

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,860
still has the rhizome central server but

00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,110
certain clients are elevated to a super

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,450
client status and that's actually where

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,760
all of the state and logic of the app

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,490
are so a client might tell the server

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,080
hey tell me about world events the

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,050
server says sure I'll do that when they

00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,330
come in and then a super client such as

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,910
the computer that I was controlling

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,530
during the performance which has all the

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,600
state and logic and is may be receiving

00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,310
events from the connect

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,410
sends a message to the central server

00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,870
saying hey everyone there's a new world

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,000
event and then the server distributes it

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,740
to everyone what this means is that the

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,199
central server is really just routing

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,730
messages and and doesn't have any logic

00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,709
built into it and it looks kind of like

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,750
this in our performance we had a few

00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:00,360
different super clients the conductor

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,190
and the performer and we also had other

00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,649
special clients like the laptop

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,850
controlling the Kinect so the Kinect

00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,709
would send a signal to the central

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,470
server which routes it to the conductor

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:12,240
because it knows the conductor is said I

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,610
want to know about connect events the

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,199
conductor goes hey cool this is like

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,490
this is like a world event thing I

00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,990
should do so it sends out a new event

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,259
and it gets sent out to all the clients

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:24,540
so just very fairly standard pub/sub and

00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:26,130
this is not like a crazy architecture

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,540
but it took me a while to figure out and

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,040
that's why I'm sharing it with you

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,279
because I'm like oh that's how you do

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,930
this it's nothing it's something that

00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,370
crazy and you might be thinking like hey

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,399
the conductor always output state to the

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,230
client in one direction and you know one

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,790
direction state and you just like you

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,440
have to mention react well the second

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,540
you talk about one direction in state

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,430
and i just want to mention it because i

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,380
did use it for the views and you're all

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,370
going to see it in a little bit it

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:55,410
worked really well to go from the state

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,120
coming in to each audience client state

00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,430
lessly render and then each client is

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,709
basically just a terminal that doesn't

00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,779
know anything but its own potential it

00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:06,509
knows what it can render it doesn't know

00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:09,689
when it needs to render or how just that

00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:11,279
it can also use these tools and I'm just

00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:14,310
going to keep going because you know i'm

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,410
sure you all have used these before next

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,920
challenge just physical challenge was

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:21,509
networking AKA how many clients can

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,029
connect to my Airport Express I'm sorry

00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:26,100
extreme this guy right down here the

00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:28,230
answer is 50 you can search high and

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,360
wide the internet and you will come up

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:34,079
with 50 it's hard coded so if you want

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,810
more you need to do your own Wi-Fi setup

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,130
and the author of the rhizome server has

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,990
actually written a blog post about how

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:44,040
to do this and it basically involves

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:45,810
custom ApS separate router separate

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,730
switch and hooking it all up and

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,430
carrying it all for the venue short

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,190
answer for us we were expecting no more

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:57,120
than 50 luckily so the airport extreme

00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:58,470
yeah brought it home the next challenge

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,000
we faced was something I'm calling

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,030
audience engineering you might consider

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,640
it user experience or user engineering

00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:08,430
or something this is this was a complex

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,720
piece to get people to buy into for

00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,240
example they had to connect to a

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,819
specific Wi-Fi access point type in a

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,650
password visit a web page all on their

00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,000
phone and check that audio works and

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,250
check that they have accelerometers

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,959
working all these things so how do we do

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,180
this well one thing we did was we just

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,670
printed out physical cards that had the

00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,900
Wi-Fi information on them and it was

00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,030
still troublesome for people people

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,040
still had trouble but it worked out

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,530
better the passwords there because you

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,970
know you have to have a password when in

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,880
New York because otherwise people will

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,720
try to steal your free internet and even

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,920
though it wasn't connected to the

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,320
Internet it would have taken up one of

00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,810
those 50 slots and last but not least

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,750
people well it's really hard to type an

00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:51,060
IP address on a phone let alone on a

00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:54,270
desktop let alone the phone so I had

00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,820
them type in playground CO and I did

00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,560
that by using my own DNS server not my

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,170
own i didn't write it I just started it

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,170
up it's super simple I had every single

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:07,020
thing any query that people asked going

00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:08,610
to pointing at my server so even google

00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,230
com would have pointed at my server all

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,820
their mail and stuff would have gone to

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,470
my server so check this out if you're

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,240
ever doing some kind of like custom art

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,040
piece within an installation you want

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,160
people to connect to it it's way easier

00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,080
than typing in an IP address next

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,690
challenge the connects the connect to

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,860
how many of you have used to connect how

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,820
many of you have programmed for a

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:32,010
connect Wow awesome so you know that you

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,450
know it's really cool super powerful but

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,550
for me this boil down to do I really

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,650
have to use windows because I'm a Mac

00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,150
I'm primarily on a Mac and I knew that

00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,490
carrying laptops around we pretty

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,330
difficult and the windows windows is

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,620
like you know do you want to program

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,210
your own body appendage and figure

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,220
tracking and I said yeah that sounds

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,410
like a ton of fun do you want to do that

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,540
you know what others have spent a PhD

00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,610
program doing in two weeks and I said

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,980
okay fine Windows you win I'll use I'll

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,200
use you and in this case it was actually

00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,970
my brother who did the mostly connect

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,740
this is him testing out front and back

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,020
detection you can see it knows which

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,280
hand is which even though he spins this

00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,140
is his contact information there if

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,060
you're curious

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,980
and this is the connect you can see it

00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,240
it tracking Jocelyn I just want to show

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,000
it to you it's way at the bottom there

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,120
but it's kind of cool so you'll see her

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,740
do the gesture

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,740
and it's actually very accurate

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:32,169
and that triggered the section the next

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:33,640
part of the piece of the audio okay by

00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:35,169
the way shaking your phone doing

00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,929
gestures you'd think these are solved

00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:39,580
they're not they're totally not they're

00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:42,700
really hard there's all these techniques

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,110
for doing it I studied a few of them I

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,669
didn't have a time to look into all them

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,659
but I wanted to walk through at least

00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:50,830
one which is called dynamic time warping

00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:52,360
just want to mention it really because I

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,429
want to make sure we have time for more

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,470
stuff but basically you take a sliding

00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:57,909
window of events you take a pattern and

00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,789
then you try to match the events to your

00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:02,580
pattern and it tries to compensate for

00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:04,929
the patterns not perfectly matching

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,130
which is cool this is a cool paper you

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,440
can read about it explains it pretty

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,080
well however I did it totally wrong and

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:14,200
it just ended up working by lucky my

00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,820
lucky chance really so there was that

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,279
and in addition one other technique for

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,470
gestures that I used was just like

00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,669
taking the magnitude of the vector of

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,830
the events as they're coming in and

00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:26,620
saying if they are all greater than 1.8

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,590
then do it it's a magic number it's just

00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,480
totally magical and it kind of works but

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,570
I would love it to be better

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,120
unfortunately slow time and finally won

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:40,480
one thing that was a challenge with the

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,010
gestures was reality versus the intent

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,279
of the piece the intent of the composer

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,380
and the intent of the the you know the

00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,909
the idea of the music some of these

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,590
gestures were really hard to do so

00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:53,409
instead of doing them we just changed

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,270
the gesture which was a compromise that

00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:58,210
I was willing to make maybe not joseline

00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:01,450
as much but you know we kind of were up

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:03,399
against a wall with some things so now

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,470
that we are now that you've gotten

00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:07,360
through that tech stuff just because I

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,830
thought you might be curious let's do

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,080
something or not you're never supposed

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,360
to do which is a live demo so I love it

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,529
if everyone could try this out we're

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,669
going to try a performance this thing

00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:20,620
right here so everyone pull out your

00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:23,070
phones has to be a phone can't be a

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:29,140
laptop it can be an iPad or a tablet

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:31,960
visit this IP address and hopefully

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,460
hopefully this works and the Wi-Fi holds

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:39,740
make sure you're on the

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:43,580
the cat pictures here Wi-Fi if you get a

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:45,560
begin button go ahead and tap it I'm

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,590
going to escape out of this for a moment

00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:52,310
just so I can make sure that things are

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:54,740
fluxing over here yeah we've got people

00:21:52,310 --> 00:22:01,100
connecting so that's good okay that's

00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:04,490
great here's the IP address again there

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,890
we go and when we've got like a

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,480
significant amount of people who are

00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,050
pressing that button and hearing square

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:16,220
waves I want to hear your square waves

00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:20,270
come on hopefully it were there's one

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:22,400
yes by the way I am asking you to turn

00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:25,370
on your phone volume so it's okay if it

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:31,760
rings it's okay if it blew you know it's

00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:38,980
going to and that's totally fine it's

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:42,230
very slow i'm sure so much javascript is

00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:46,070
it coming is it like pausing for some

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:52,190
people like your nice nice it's kind of

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:53,630
their sort of okay let's wait like two

00:22:52,190 --> 00:23:01,550
minutes and see if we can get everyone

00:22:53,630 --> 00:23:04,490
kind of connected also it shows the grid

00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:06,290
there and the grid is somewhat arbitrary

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:11,980
but it's basically you know the front is

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:11,980
us so the top of your phone is us yeah

00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,660
is anyone having like just crazy crazy

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:23,020
issues I feel like we're kind of good

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:27,920
here oh really it won't stop playing

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:30,260
okay oh no well I do love the sound of

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,480
square waves frankly especially in the

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:41,710
morning or the afternoon where are we

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:44,260
all right Berlin alright cool

00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:49,090
feel like maybe we're yeah we're okay

00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:51,669
yeah so obviously this the demo is going

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:55,929
to not have a piano Stan we didn't

00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:59,380
sponsor my talk so there's going to be

00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:01,090
kind of like a modified demo where I'm

00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,710
not going to be really that much

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:06,520
involved so you guys are kind of like an

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:12,610
autonomous system just doing your own

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:14,770
improvising for most of the time but

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:26,559
let's just see something here question

00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:29,980
Oh question wizard oh no no the the

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:36,159
Wi-Fi of the convention cat pictures

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:38,980
here cat pictures here get your cat

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:47,679
pictures actually miles had great ones

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:52,840
we had none yeah failing you all all

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:57,010
right I think my socket did die hoo boy

00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:02,289
wow it died alright well we'll just try

00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:05,770
it again this is how you test scale by

00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:07,090
the way in production it's actually this

00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,220
I want to talk about this but it's a

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:13,210
very difficult thing to test to get this

00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:15,640
many phones give it a minute get a

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:19,909
minute I should hit the wrong the other

00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:22,909
button alright see ya

00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:22,909
ok

00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:45,260
there we go cool we have 64 people

00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:46,880
connected or so maybe some more cool all

00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,870
right you just try it yeah all right

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,520
let's just try it we're running out of

00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:59,050
time I don't want to go over too much

00:25:49,520 --> 00:26:03,550
here so uh what oh no I'm still getting

00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:06,770
requests sort of yeah they're coming in

00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:09,860
hmm I mean my we'll see what might have

00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:14,750
my laptop can handle it but all right

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:26,330
let's just do later let's try it go

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:28,870
ahead oh oh did I again no did the Wi-Fi

00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,990
actually die

00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:35,440
oh no did it did it really die I think

00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:38,860
it really died because if my phone

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,360
doesn't have Wi-Fi anymore all right

00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,809
we'll do it from the will do it from the

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:49,030
computer here all right all right here

00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:51,070
we go so yeah this is hang on a sec hang

00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:58,090
I said no it's not it doesn't work that

00:26:51,070 --> 00:27:03,750
right there we go try that did it quick

00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:06,400
oh does it not it's a touch you I

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:12,130
it doesn't have click events it has tap

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:19,120
events hang on a sec there's a way to do

00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:22,120
this this is i use firefox every day

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:26,530
just so you know just not we're in

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:31,890
responsive mode device there we go thank

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:39,850
you could be a six yes you ready yep

00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:43,230
just okay alright hopefully it follows

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,230
along hopefully your phones are sink

00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,670
Oh

00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:02,190
so all right

00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,290
Oh

00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:15,120
I have you gotta go almost ok so I think

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:20,160
we're like totally out of time sorry for

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:22,980
going over I hope it was okay you want

00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:29,210
to see anything else yeah uh well uh so

00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:29,210
everyone's a rock star now so yeah
