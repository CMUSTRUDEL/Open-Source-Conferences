# Why Empathy Matters

Empathy can be a pivotal factor in the success of yourself and your projects. If you don’t care about the people using your product, why are you making it? If you don’t care about your co-workers who will have to use your code, why do you work with them? If you don’t care about yourself, why are you doing this as a career?

Some people may ask “why empathy?”. Let’s examine this concept, find ways to be more empathetic in our actions, and discuss the pragmatism of empathy.

This talk will explore various ways in which developers can be more empathetic to the community, their co-workers, and themselves. The talk will also explore larger ways we as an industry can work together to improve empathy.

reject hi um hi I'm miles thank you all

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,279
for taking the time today I was thinking

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,230
you know can we just give a quick round

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,460
of applause to everyone from reject

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,390
who's put on this really amazing

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,390
conference today

00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,590
like well they didn't start the timer so

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,420
that didn't work as well as I hoped but

00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,250
so I'm currently pretty fun employed and

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,230
between gigs it worked out really

00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,620
greatly it happened right before burning

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:57,650
man so I had a lot of time to enjoy and

00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,300
plan but don't worry I've got something

00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,690
really exciting plan but I can't tell

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,339
you about it yet but so you know the

00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,470
reason I mentioned what I do is a great

00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:07,970
way to start a lot of talks is to look

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,580
at the audience and let them know hey

00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,399
this is why I'm qualified to tell you

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,930
what I'm about to tell you so you know

00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:17,420
empathy is a really interesting topic

00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,860
and there is you know there's some

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,020
interesting reasons why I'm qualified to

00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,090
talk to you about it so I have an

00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,360
undergraduate degree in fine art I

00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,530
studied some Marxism I studied some

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,570
digital technology culture some

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,280
posthumanism you know none of that

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,759
really matters to talk about empathy

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,380
though I have a master's degree in music

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,360
you know music is all about connecting

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,979
with people and all that but like you

00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,200
know that doesn't really matter either

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,959
it turns out I'm qualified to talk to

00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,550
about empathy because I'm a human being

00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:50,690
and we'll get back to why that matters

00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,709
later but right now you know I'm going

00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,479
to give you a quick breakdown on what

00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:55,550
we're going to talk about we're going to

00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,619
give a quick definition of what empathy

00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,209
is we're going to follow that up with

00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:01,880
describing what's the difference between

00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:03,140
empathy and sympathy those are two

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,330
things that are very very similar

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,970
they're often confused but they're also

00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,950
very different and you know sympathy can

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,660
actually be pretty toxic believe it or

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,819
not we're going to talk about the

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,370
history of the term empathy where does

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,450
it come from how did it evolve it's not

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,129
as old as you think it's a little

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,900
spoiler we're going to talk about the

00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:22,220
neuroscience of empathy how we're wired

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,260
for empathy why does this actually

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,090
happen we're going to follow that up

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,970
with about the concept of learning

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,410
empathy it turns out you know even

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,900
though we're naturally wired to be

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,209
empathetic it's not supernatural to

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,739
follow through on that then we're going

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,360
to talk about empathy as a developer

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,760
really short we're not going to really

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,920
focus on that too much but we'll start

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,290
with this definition there's a fantastic

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,380
paper by Teresa Wiseman defining the

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,450
attributes of empathy she's a nurse this

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,740
paper is specifically focused on nursing

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,330
but she studied many professions and I

00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,650
think you know it's a pretty global

00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,329
thing

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,739
so the first thing about being

00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:58,569
empathetic is understanding the

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,750
perspective of the person in which

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:03,519
you're being empathetic to it's

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,860
important to stay out of judgment it's

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,819
really easy to judge an individual you

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,150
can't do that if you're going to

00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,920
empathize you need to recognize what

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,510
they're feeling you need to figure out

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,670
that feeling you need to separate it and

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,769
you need to really understand it and you

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,730
need to follow up by communicating back

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:27,010
to the individual what that feeling is

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:28,659
empathy is feeling with people so

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,670
Theresa Wiseman have this great quote in

00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:33,400
our paper it is the ability to empathize

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,470
which distinguishes an average nurse

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,260
from an excellent nurse and the eyes of

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,290
the patient so I'm going to go and just

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,689
you know step out and say hey perhaps it

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,180
is the ability to empathize that

00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:47,980
distinguishes an average developer from

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,739
an excellent developer in the eyes of

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,629
others and then you know maybe even take

00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,489
it stretch further and it's the ability

00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:56,920
to empathize which distinguishes an

00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:59,319
average human being from an excellent

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,319
human being I don't know I kind of like

00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:06,329
that so let that sit in we'll take a

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:11,709
trip a trip ekt break think about that I

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:13,810
were good cool so empathy versus

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,000
sympathy I'm going to cheat I'm gonna

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,889
play a video it's an amazing video I

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,510
can't actually say it better than this

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,340
video does so we're going to watch it

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,560
it's a video by brené Brown it's from

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,820
RSA the Royal Society of the Arts and

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:34,870
I'm just going to I'm not going to

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:38,139
introduce it any more than that so what

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:41,729
is empathy and why is it very different

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:45,639
than sympathy empathy fuels connection

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:47,770
sympathy drives disconnection empathy

00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,669
it's a very interesting Teresa Wiseman

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,260
is a nursing scholar who studied

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,760
professions very diverse professions

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,159
where empathy is relevant and came up

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,260
with four qualities of empathy

00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,760
perspective taking the ability to take

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,500
the perspective of another person or

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,110
recognize their perspective as their

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,729
truth staying out of judgment not easy

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,800
when you enjoy it as much as most of us

00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,940
do

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,690
recognizing emotion and other people and

00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,450
then communicating that empathy is

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:19,580
feeling with people and to me I always

00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,700
think of empathy is this kind of sacred

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,800
space when someone's kind of in a deep

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,680
hole and they shout out from the bottom

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,740
and they say I'm stuck it's dark I'm

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,310
overwhelmed and then we look and we say

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:37,640
hey on down I know what it's like down

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:46,040
here and you're not alone sympathy is

00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:50,960
ooh it's bad uh-huh uh no you want

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:52,640
sandwich if he is a choice and it's a

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,220
vulnerable choice because in order to

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,560
connect with you I have to connect with

00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,040
something in myself that knows that

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:06,440
feeling rarely if ever does an empathic

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:09,440
response begin with at least I had a

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,000
yeah and we do it all the time because

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,680
you know what someone just shared

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,050
something with us that's incredibly

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,760
painful and we're trying to silver

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,880
lining it I don't think that's a verb

00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,590
but I'm using it as one we're trying to

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,860
put this a little running around it so I

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,810
had a miscarriage at least you know you

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,270
can get pregnant I think my marriage is

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,540
falling apart at least you have a

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,540
marriage

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,660
John's getting kicked out of school at

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,820
least Sarah is an A student but one of

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:45,410
the things we do sometimes in the face

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:47,900
of very difficult conversations is we

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,370
try to make things better if I share

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,610
something with you that's very difficult

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,810
I'd whether you say I don't even know

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,770
what to say right now I'm just so glad

00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:00,230
you told me because the truth is rarely

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,270
can a response make something better

00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:10,040
what makes something better is

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:12,950
connection so you're going to notice

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,360
that there's a handful of things that I

00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,400
kind of lifted right out of that I'm

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,780
sampling all through this talk that'll

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,860
make sure to kind of give reference so

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,480
you can see where I'm grabbing things

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,260
from one of the important things I'm

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,150
going to do here is I'm going to

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,800
constantly repeat things that I think

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,960
are really important for you to absorb

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,220
and that's if any of you ever do any

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,380
public speaking that's a really great

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,730
technique it's just repeat yourself over

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,800
and over because like I have the

00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,570
attention span of like a fly so by

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,040
repeating things you can make sure that

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:40,430
like that important information gets out

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,560
there so as they said empathy is feeling

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:47,180
with you sympathy is feeling for you

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,370
empathy is about being present with

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:54,920
someone empathy is a choice rarely can a

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,250
response make something better what

00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,360
makes something better as a connection

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:05,690
another trip ekt break just think about

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,890
it I love this one it's like smoke so

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,840
let's get into the history this is going

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:12,770
to get really really dry I'm sorry but

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,660
it's kind of cool and a spoiler believe

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:18,650
it or not the term empathy is only about

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,180
a hundred years old so romantic thinkers

00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,430
in the 18th century such as herder in

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,440
Novalis question the contemporary notion

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,180
of aesthetics and aesthetics we're

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,010
talking about in kind of like art

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,460
history the aesthetics of art what makes

00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:33,350
something beautiful what evokes emotion

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,630
the main problem was that of expression

00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,540
if our nature are incapable of

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,400
expressing human feelings how then can

00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,320
they if they're incapable of

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,650
experiencing human feelings how can they

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,540
express them how can i get like sad and

00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,269
melodramatic looking at a pain

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,959
of a tree doesn't really make sense tree

00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:57,139
doesn't feel as far as i know it works

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,389
so in 1870 to a German philosopher

00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:01,579
Robert Fischer proposed an answer that

00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:03,560
the explanation must lie in some

00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:07,339
unconscious process of the person who

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,649
views these forms and I'm going to

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,630
totally mess this up actually know what

00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,829
rather than me saying it on the count of

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,959
three two all the German audience

00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:20,139
members want to say this word for me

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,139
we're going to try it okay one two three

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:32,600
that was awesome and this directly

00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:34,370
translates into feeling into so if you

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,930
looked at art you would feel into the

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,769
art you would see something beautiful

00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:42,529
you would feel into it this idea was

00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:44,720
first elaborated by Vishal ER in his

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:48,319
paper dose yeah I'm going to mess that

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,560
one up to opt each form mango fool it

00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:53,870
was I close no okay whatever aesthetic

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,790
pleasure may thus be explained as

00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,000
objectified self enjoyment in which

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:03,380
subject and object are fused our ability

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,660
to feel into art this was further

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,880
explored by another German philosopher

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,699
Theodore lips in the aesthetic that

00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,350
woman was easy he closely links our

00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:14,269
aesthetic perception and our perception

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,459
of another embodied person as a minded

00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:18,769
creature the nature of aesthetic empathy

00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:23,899
is always the experience of another

00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:26,180
human so in 1999 in 1909 the term

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:28,550
empathy was introduced by psychologist

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:32,959
Edward itchin or as a Trent as

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:34,740
transliteration of the german term thank

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:42,790
you

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:48,720
so another trippy kitty break I love

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,720
that one one more time I'm a bumblebee

00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:56,350
okay so let's talk about the

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,910
neuroscience of empathy many of the

00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,350
ideas i'm about to discuss came from

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,610
this talk we're not good we're not going

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,830
to watch this one it's ten minutes long

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,850
that would be super cheating it was kind

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,490
of cheating before this would be really

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,450
cheating but the slides are online I'll

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,450
tweet a link to it you should definitely

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,770
watch this video it's really cool it

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,570
builds on the ideas that I'm about to

00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,930
talk about I won't spoil it anymore just

00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:23,140
watch it it's awesome but so healthy

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:25,240
human brains are wired for empathy one

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,720
such phenomenon is what's known as

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,790
mirror neurons so basically the neurons

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,500
fires both when you're performing an

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,000
action and when you observe someone else

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,040
performing an action and and this is

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,270
like a little clip from that RSA Animate

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,390
video that's linked in the previous

00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:43,480
slide so this was first discovered by

00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,490
italian scientists in the 1990s giacomo

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,960
rizzolatti a neuroscientist at the

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,370
university of paramount noticed this

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,890
strange phenomenon with a monkey and

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,690
some peanuts so essentially they had

00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:56,620
this experiment setup and the monkey was

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:58,900
set up to an MRI and they were watching

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,430
what happened to the monkeys brain as he

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,170
ate and so the monkey would you know

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,970
like open the pinna put in his mouth and

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,740
like all the stuff would be firing off

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,190
and they're like we're scientist this is

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:11,710
awesome and then something really

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,320
amazing happened one of the scientists

00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,970
got really really hungry and decided

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,860
just eat a peanut in front of the monkey

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:22,180
well it was still connected to the MRI

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:24,610
and all of a sudden the monkeys neurons

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,290
that fired when he ate the peanut fired

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,360
when when the scientist ate the peanut

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,420
this is like people were like what is

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,530
wrong here like this machine is broken

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,750
but it turned out that there's this

00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:37,090
phenomenon called mirror neurons when

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,580
you witness someone doing something you

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,890
you can like sense it the neurons fire

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,270
off you know like if I fell off the

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,490
stage right now and hit my head

00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,320
everybody like a little and then I'd be

00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,310
really embarrassing would suck but like

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,720
if you see someone

00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,970
a spider you kind of get that crawly

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,130
feeling you know you see someone get get

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,320
hurt you feel it it were wired for this

00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,720
it's really it's pretty phenomenal and

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,020
this kind of challenges a lot of early

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,580
ideas about how humans are wired how

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,680
things work a lot of how our

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,050
civilization has been built on like

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,420
these notions of selfhood of oneness of

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,710
not being connected to people that's

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,779
what this the other talk that I

00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,690
reference is all about i really suggest

00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:19,270
that you watch it but so Marco Jacoby

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,520
professor of psychiatry and I hate bio

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,830
behavioral sciences argue that neural

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,870
neurons are the neural basis of the

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:29,950
human capacity for emotions such as

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:30,880
empathy so you know again if we if we go

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,250
back to what we were talking in the

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,710
history this concept has been around for

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,900
about you know like a hundred 150 years

00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,970
and now all of a sudden you know like 20

00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,130
years ago we're getting research that's

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,020
showing hey you know like not only is

00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,820
this like a phenomena that we can talk

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,860
about philosophically there's actually

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,190
like a scientific back background behind

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,480
this like we're wired to do this so like

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,670
some other examples that you can see is

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,080
when a baby cries in a nursery all the

00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,380
other babies join in this is a

00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,450
phenomenon called empathic distress so

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,490
you know we can watch the growth of

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,930
children and we can kind of see you know

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,850
around the age of two and a half a child

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,770
starts actually being able to recognize

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,900
their self in a mirror this this sense

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,180
of self pneus comes in and the sense of

00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,310
selfhood goes hand in hand with an

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,960
empathic development now that they have

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,850
self they can look at others and start

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,610
like understanding you know if this

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,940
person hurts themselves I can kind of

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,740
feel it I can relate with that so the

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,600
next slide I'm going to apologize so

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,950
this first one is from the first season

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,570
of full house and I tried to find a

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,520
really good one Michelle tanner because

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,510
the next size about eight year olds but

00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,850
I couldn't get an eight year-old

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,440
michelle tanner unfortunately but it's

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,910
around eight years of age a child starts

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,430
learning about birth and death they

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,339
learn about vulnerability and this

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,959
starts like really it starts with like

00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:48,640
an existential trip you start

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,220
understanding that you only have one

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,690
life that's slowly over time the things

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,800
that you do matter and then you start

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,930
looking at other people and you think

00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,310
wow those people only have one life and

00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,410
we're all kind of in this struggle

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,000
together and and now you're it just

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,339
grows that empathy you start thinking

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,260
hey

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:09,910
that person they have their own life

00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:11,589
it's their own thing it builds it once

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,570
you realize you only have one life you

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,160
can now feel other struggles you know

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,760
that they have their own lives you know

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,980
their struggles some philosophers such

00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,990
as Schopenhauer believe that the

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,089
empathic emotions such as compassion are

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:28,240
possible because we're all part of a

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:29,860
greater ontological whole it's pretty

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,860
cool concept we're all kind of part of

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,390
one thing this again kind of goes

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,040
against a lot of what our culture has

00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,970
been built upon and a lot of what our

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:42,399
value systems have been built upon it's

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,410
important to remember though that while

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,589
our ability is to feel empathy may be

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:50,080
soft wired our ability to act on it is a

00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:52,240
learned trait I really want you to think

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,209
about that because not everyone is

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,970
naturally empathetic it can be really

00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:01,120
really hard to make yourself vulnerable

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:03,940
to truly empathize with someone is not

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,040
easy and so you shouldn't feel ashamed

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,200
if you're not naturally just like the

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,610
most feely amazing person in the world

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,290
hugging everyone and feeling it

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,240
constantly this is something you have to

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:17,650
work on you have to you have to like

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,330
build on these natural urges so we're

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:22,839
going to now talk a little bit about

00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:25,810
learning empathy so this is a great

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:27,940
quote from a paper on education

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,610
expressing care for another person is

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,920
not an innate ability present more

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,510
naturally in some people than others but

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,190
rather a skill that can be taught and

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,160
nurtured through a supportive

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,260
educational environment it's really

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,810
interesting as you go through some of

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,130
the literature they start talking about

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,920
the importance of empathy as a teacher

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,200
and specifically kind of the idea that

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,779
when you're teaching you shouldn't be

00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,420
teaching the content you should be

00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:56,920
teaching the feeling like at the end the

00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,149
knowledge itself is not really as

00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:04,120
important as creating whole human beings

00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:07,360
so it turns out that for myself empathy

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,980
was something I had to learn so let's go

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,910
down a little bit of an anecdote and

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:14,679
let's get real for the second here this

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,680
is a young me would have been even

00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,610
younger a little kid

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:22,670
who is my younger brother um I was a bit

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:25,490
of a like not totally I wasn't

00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:28,730
the worst but I was very self-involved I

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:31,670
suffer from pretty crazy ADHD I didn't

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,440
really understand like when they talked

00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,790
about at like eight years ago you start

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,410
like recognizing other people and

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,750
understanding them like that didn't

00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,160
actually come naturally to me I didn't

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,480
really understand it i was super

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,720
self-involved and I was super

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,310
self-involved for quite a while so like

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,610
you know like I wasn't exactly a problem

00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:51,560
child but I was never very observant I

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,900
went through a good chunk of my life

00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,910
without having very meaningful

00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,410
relationships and this is even within my

00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,620
own family it was just you know

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:05,030
unfortunate but it's just what happened

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:07,490
then I met Christina so she's very

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,830
different than I am she patiently taught

00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:13,790
me how to be observant and how to feel

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:17,630
for others so sharing my life with

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:21,110
someone made me a better person and has

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,660
made me a more empathetic person it's

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:26,140
important to remember well our ability

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:30,260
to feel empathy may be soft wired our

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:35,260
ability to learn it our ability to act

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:41,120
on it is a learned trait ask yourself

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:42,500
Who am I who is the other and I'm going

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,840
to ask you all if you have time to go

00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,360
and look up the term other there's a lot

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,740
of really amazing philosophy about this

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,390
concept of the other and it's something

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,030
that's like hardwired into our culture

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:57,170
and super freaking toxic but who is this

00:18:53,030 --> 00:19:03,940
other how are they other why are they

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:07,520
other how do we relate what do we share

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:11,930
what do they need from me and I from

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,350
them so a trippy katie break I was

00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,350
really heavy

00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:23,830
so empathy as a developer so there's

00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:26,149
three places that we can focus on this

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:30,619
having empathy for the people you make

00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:34,309
things for having empathy for those you

00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:37,220
make things with and having empathy for

00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:38,450
yourself which truthfully is kind of the

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,710
place you need to start because if you

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,830
don't have empathy for yourself you

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:44,869
can't empathize for anyone else so

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,460
having empathy for the people you make

00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:48,979
things for how are ways that we can do

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,659
that accessibility is a really easy one

00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,639
we've seen some really great talks today

00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:54,799
about accessibility know who's using

00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:57,769
your software know who's using your

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,509
site's care about all of them no one

00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:02,269
user is less important than the other

00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:05,389
there's a really really great concept

00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:07,700
called the poor child the the idea is if

00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:09,109
you maintain multiple code bases one of

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,759
them is just not going to be cared for

00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:12,409
as much as the other make sure there's

00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,909
no poor children make sure you care

00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:16,729
about everyone that you're making

00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:19,099
software for performance and bandwidth

00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:22,129
not everyone that you're making software

00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:24,739
for is on a brand new MacBook Pro and

00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:26,720
living in a city with cheap data plans

00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:28,249
think about the people around the world

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,820
who are going to be using your software

00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:33,649
think about how to make it easy for them

00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,999
empathize for them you there's tools

00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,399
that are available like I think it's

00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:39,409
called comcast fi it's really amazing it

00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:41,659
will like slow down your internet

00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:43,609
connection to a halt so that you can

00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:47,119
like experience like how bad it is to be

00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:48,739
on Comcast but no but like put these

00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,869
tools into your workflow see what it's

00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:52,369
like go on to sites that can go and give

00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:55,039
you an idea of how much it costs to just

00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:56,779
load your web page on a random site and

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,340
I say this as like I have this like I

00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:00,799
think there's like 100 megabytes just to

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,179
load my slide presentation so you know

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,090
like I understand that you can't always

00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:07,159
do it but think about it platform

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:10,009
support you know not everyone is going

00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:13,070
to be on OS X not everyone is going to

00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:15,259
be on Windows you know like a really

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,690
funny anecdote I recently was talking to

00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:18,619
a friend of mine who I won't name the

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,779
company cuz I don't wanna get them in

00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:22,940
trouble but so what's really really cool

00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,499
is everyone thinks you know Internet

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,200
Explorer is the worst and you know I

00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:28,580
don't want to support IE 8 turns out you

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,350
know what's going to really make our

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:35,049
lives really difficult

00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:37,100
safari because because it turns out that

00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:39,230
windows at least gives people the option

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,760
of updating their browser if you have an

00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,289
old macbook like you know your

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,600
grandmother you gave her your macbook

00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:46,580
because you're such a nice grandkid or

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,220
you gave it to your grandfather or your

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:53,630
cousin an old macbook actually can't

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:55,490
upgrade to the new OS X which means you

00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,470
can't upgrade to the new safari so you

00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,960
end up with all these old safaris that

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,760
have all these really weird bugs think

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,860
about that be aware of that when you

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,590
make like a really flashy splash page

00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:12,380
for your like healthcare startup maybe

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:15,049
that's a bad idea build your user not

00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,970
for yourself this is a huge thing I see

00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:18,169
people doing all the time you know you

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,549
feature creep yourself with all the

00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:22,220
amazing things you think your site could

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:24,710
do maybe your users just don't care

00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,960
which brings us to the final one listen

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:31,039
to them talk to them like actually go

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,090
meet them care about them having empathy

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,980
for those you make things with

00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,929
documentation is just like a no-brainer

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,419
I'm not even gonna bother talking but

00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:43,789
you all know what I'm going to say

00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:46,159
testing same thing just do it like let's

00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:48,230
do it onboarding this is a really

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,820
interesting one so I helped organize a

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,309
conference called jQuery SF and there

00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,020
was a really amazing talk by John rezac

00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:57,620
who's the creator of jQuery and he

00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:59,030
talked about empathy for for his you

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,950
know end users who were developers

00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,270
working with the jQuery platform so it's

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,130
interesting too if you make developer

00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,320
tools empathizing for those who make

00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,760
things with is empathizing for those you

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,530
make things for it's the same person

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,780
it's also kind of empathizing for

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,960
yourself to 10 turns out they're all the

00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:17,179
same but so he talks about onboarding

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,580
people on the first day and the first

00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:21,590
week and the first month someone should

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,900
be able to sit down and get running

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,909
within 20 minutes without really hitting

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,230
any roadblocks then in the first week

00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:29,150
they should be able to get running and

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,919
not really have problems to have the

00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,840
documentation they need to do a basic

00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,730
something and then a month like they

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,159
should have the support that's necessary

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,780
to just get things done that was one of

00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,419
the first things jquery did that's why

00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,799
it was so successful ray-ban go is the

00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,029
first developer working on the jquery

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,559
project and he literally would go

00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:47,119
around the entire internet and find

00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,759
every single problem that anyone had

00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,679
with jquery hunt them down and fix it or

00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,809
at least support them first class

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,739
support was really important so think

00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:56,659
about that when you're bringing new

00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:57,979
employees into your office how did it

00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,690
feel on your first day when you showed

00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:01,340
up and someone handed you like a massive

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,929
rail stack was like install post grass

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:07,909
and you're like what's address you know

00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:09,830
why am i posted be a good Ally and boast

00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:11,629
in the sense of a 11 y and also in the

00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,129
sense as a human being if you haven't

00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:14,899
heard this term go Google what it means

00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:16,879
to be an ally go Google what it means to

00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:18,649
be a bad a lie that's a great one look

00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:19,969
at like there's some really really great

00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:21,919
blogs if you want to know tweet me I'll

00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:23,779
send you some of them one of the best

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,029
things you can do to is go out and find

00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:27,710
this out for yourself don't expect every

00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:29,989
person from an underrepresented minority

00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:33,070
to go and be a text book for you the

00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:36,229
information is out there go find it

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:39,529
listen to them talk to them listen to

00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:43,039
them hear what they have to say having

00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:45,589
empathy for yourself which as I saying

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,960
was one of the most important things set

00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:50,210
healthy boundaries be in at a certain

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,830
time be out at a certain time something

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,739
that I really enjoy doing at my last job

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:57,200
I'm one of those people who like if I'm

00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:58,609
not into something I just can't do it

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,830
but the second I get like wired on it

00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:01,909
I'll just like work non-stop and usually

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,889
that happens it like two in the morning

00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:05,899
if you go on my github report card it's

00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:07,489
really funny and like starts and it like

00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:08,779
you know like eleven o'clock it goes up

00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:10,580
and I'm like three o'clock i'm really

00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:12,229
doing integer job and then it dumps

00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,489
around like six when I go home and I

00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:14,719
hang out with Christina and then she

00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:15,979
usually goes to bed around eleven and

00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:17,389
that shoots up again around two in the

00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:20,359
morning and then it bottoms out around

00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:22,489
like four or five so I had to deal with

00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:24,229
my manager which was essentially hey if

00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:26,239
I have a really really good night and

00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:27,889
I'm really dialed in I'm going to work

00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:29,599
and you know what I'm not coming in the

00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:31,849
next day and it was fine because the

00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,919
work got done set healthy boundaries for

00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:37,369
yourself be honest with the people that

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,749
you work with listen to your body one

00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,429
thing that I learned recently which was

00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:42,859
really great and I'm not going to lie I

00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:44,029
did it last night instead of staying up

00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:45,830
all night you know what I'll do is I'll

00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:47,149
go to sleep early and then wake up at

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:49,339
like five in the morning and get things

00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:50,929
done when I'm well-rested think about

00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,220
how your body is if you're hungry eat if

00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:53,419
you're not hungry don't eat I like I

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,690
don't need to tell you that you know how

00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:57,810
to listen be aware of imposter syndrome

00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,160
it's a thing if

00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,780
you haven't heard about it google it if

00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,800
you have heard about it stop doing it

00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:07,800
we're all awesome but seriously like I

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,480
mean we're all pretty amazing people

00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,370
like when you actually look at how many

00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,230
people are able to do what we're doing

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,180
in the world it's not many like

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,790
recognize that recognize how amazing you

00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,340
are don't tear yourself down you'll be

00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:22,260
the first person to do it listen to

00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:26,490
yourself talk to yourself not in public

00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:28,500
but talk to yourself okay so let's bring

00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,850
it all back let's repeat everything i

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,750
said before so we can think about it

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,990
again let's hack time well we may be

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:39,650
soft wired for empathy the term is only

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:42,150
existed for about a hundred years

00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:43,560
theresa Wiseman's defining attributes of

00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,270
empathy let's go over this one more time

00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,290
do people want to say it with me or is

00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,820
that just weird you want to say it with

00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:51,480
me that's cheesy I'm going to just say

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:54,750
it understand perspective stay out of

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:59,580
judgment recognize what they are feeling

00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:01,740
and communicate it back it is important

00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,780
to remember well our ability to be to

00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,020
feel empathy may be soft wired our

00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,280
ability to act on it is a learned trait

00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:11,340
don't be down on yourself if you're not

00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,800
naturally empathetic you you can build

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,530
on this you can learn and even if you're

00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,060
not soft wired for it you can learn

00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:22,560
you're in this room because you're good

00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:25,410
learners you can learn empathizing

00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:31,700
requires for you to be vulnerable that

00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:35,640
can be scary empathy is a choice

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:43,050
astronaut how am I unique but rather how

00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:45,380
are we the same feel with people rarely

00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:47,460
can a response make something better

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:52,110
what makes something better is

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:55,590
connection maybe what you say doesn't

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:58,470
matter maybe the only thing that matters

00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:05,420
in the end are the relationships that

00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:05,420
you build thank you very much

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,350
