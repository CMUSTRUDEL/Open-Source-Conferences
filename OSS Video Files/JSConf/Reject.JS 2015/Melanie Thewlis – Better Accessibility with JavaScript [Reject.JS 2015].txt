# Better Accessibility with JavaScript

Making the web accessible to people with all abilities is a key social justice issue of our era. Unfortunately, there’s still a lack of commonly adopted best practices. For developers, it can feel like a daunting challenge to sort through all the relevant technical documentation and work out how to apply it.

This talk aims to address this problem by presenting some practical and easy to apply code samples that can significantly improve the web experience for people with a range of disabilities. It will also demonstrate how common Javascript libraries can be built upon to allow assistive technologies to access features of rich web applications such as maps, filtering and carousels.

As well as looking at the code, there will be a short introduction to the legislative framework, technical specifications, project management and testing approaches for developing accessible websites.

reject I can everyone hear me okay at

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,769
the back it's fine yeah okay cool I will

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,779
just start by saying thank you very much

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,490
for having me to speak it's an

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,720
incredible honor and a pleasure to be

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:33,570
here and to be part of this great

00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,340
JavaScript community maybe I'll start

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,360
and introduce myself a little bit my

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,160
name is Melanie I'm lead web developer

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,079
and co-founder of little web giants

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,730
we're a small digital agency we do

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:50,129
websites and online marketing I am

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,430
actually pretty much a self-taught

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,140
developer my background is in

00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,500
environmental activism and social

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,789
justice work so I'm not really here to

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,260
talk to you about any kind of like

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,990
amazing higher-level cutting-edge

00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,360
brand-new acma script stuff I'm kind of

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,070
reporting back from the trenches of some

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,990
practical stuff that I've experienced in

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:21,200
my work and wanted to kind of share with

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:23,759
you guys today in our work we do sorry

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,439
we do a lot of work with not-for-profit

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,340
organizations and the renewable energy

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,810
industry and as part of this we're

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,180
working a lot with organizations that

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,430
are receiving government funding and

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,200
this kind of plays into why I became

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,409
really interested in this topic of

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,060
accessibility because will first start

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,399
often if you're receiving government

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,890
funding there is some compulsion that

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,229
you should meet a minimum accessibility

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,079
requirements in the web products that

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,049
you develop and I think also it's it's

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,270
for me a really burning an important

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,770
issue because I think access to the

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,049
internet and access to all the

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,450
information and tools and communities

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,280
that are available online is an

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,530
incredibly transformative and powerful

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,940
thing in people's lives and at a time

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,009
when we're seeing the Internet is kind

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,140
of becoming more closed and more

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,700
proprietary software and kind of closing

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,150
off into these

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,510
war gardens ensuring that everyone

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,310
everywhere has access to free and open

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,290
education and free and open Internet I

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,910
think is really one of the most

00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,730
important social justice issues of our

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,410
times so today I'm just going to show

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,010
you some kind of little tips and tricks

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,200
that you can use to hopefully not so

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,060
much effort to implement but can

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,150
actually really radically transform how

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:46,510
accessible your web projects are to a

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:49,400
wide range of people okay so starting

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:52,400
from what do we mean by accessibility

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,650
when we hear this word we often tend to

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,900
think of it in terms of our we need to

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,060
cater for people who have specific

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,890
disabilities we can kind of broadly

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,739
break this down into people with some

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:06,470
sort of visual impairment or the blind

00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:08,060
auditory unable to hear a cognitive

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,010
issue so this might be either an

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,069
intellectual disability or a learning

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,690
disability or people who just their

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:18,950
first language is not the language of

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,900
the website in question and then finally

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,540
we have motor disabilities so this is

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,790
relating to how well or how not well

00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,200
you're able to to move which of course

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:31,850
then relates to how well you're able to

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,410
control a mouse and a keyboard so we

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,200
tend to kind of think of these groups as

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,620
being served by specific assistive

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,359
technologies so if you have visual

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,000
impairment then some of the tools you

00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:45,769
might use include screen readers so on

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,739
Mac there's the voiceover for windows

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:50,900
there's this software called jaws other

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,639
approaches we can take as designers and

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,500
developers is to ensure our designs are

00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,650
very legible you know not kind of too

00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,319
cluttered and things like this if

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,590
there's auditory impairment then we can

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,200
kind of serve people who have this

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,510
problem through the use of subtitles or

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:13,910
the use of alternative text for audio or

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:15,889
video content for people who have some

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,340
sort of cognitive impairment then it can

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:21,039
be really really useful to a supply

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:24,020
alternative content in the form of

00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:26,960
simpler text it's easier to understand

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,290
and maybe supplemented with images as

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,050
well

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,540
in Germany there's like this kind of

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,970
concept is actually formally legislated

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,760
and it's known as lactis rocker so

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,070
that's easy speech and you can actually

00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,230
hire someone who will do translation

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:46,370
from kind of normal German to this

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,840
lightish barca for you and then finally

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,810
when we're looking at motor impairment

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,680
then we tend to think of how can we make

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,960
our websites navigable using the

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,240
keyboard so that people who maybe are

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,270
not able to control a mouse particularly

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,240
well have an alternative way to access

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,340
the information on a website so this is

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,900
quite a sort of literal interpretation

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,180
of what accessibility means so we

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,040
identify a disability or a set of

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,230
disabilities and then we identify the

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:20,060
assistive technologies that we should

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:22,040
work to support but I do like to think

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,710
about accessibility as a little bit more

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,690
broad than that as I said earlier I

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,920
think it really comes down to a big

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,780
social justice issue and so it could be

00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,910
more than just people that we would

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,210
consider as following under some kind of

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:40,580
banner of disabled so accessibility is

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,920
also thinking about how do we make our

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:46,010
work inclusive to people across a whole

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,050
range of age spectrums how do we reach

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,030
out to older people how do we make sure

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,100
that information is also accessible to

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,800
younger people people might have

00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,790
different educational cultural

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,860
backgrounds so if you're seeking to

00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,540
provide information maybe you need to

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,010
think about the sort of stories or

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,740
metaphors or parables that you're

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,940
telling that might not apply to certain

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,690
cultural groups that you're trying to

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:10,760
reach and depending on the purpose of

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,590
your project Internet bandwidth may also

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,660
be an accessibility issue you know if

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,080
you're trying to send like 20 megabytes

00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:20,990
of really beautiful high-resolution

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,020
images down the line to someone in like

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:27,740
sub-saharan Africa you're not really

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,300
serving them at all so it really can

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,100
depend on the needs of your project but

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,110
I think thinking about accessibility is

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,750
really thinking in his broad terms as

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:39,640
possible how do we reach an audience

00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,640
serve an audience and empower people

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:46,919
so I'm going to talk briefly about the

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,800
kind of legal frameworks that exists and

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,680
some of the like w3c specifications that

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,440
exist that we should be trying to fall

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,550
in line with technically and then in the

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,410
final part of the talk I'll talk a

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,770
little bit more about how you can apply

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,210
that in a more practical sense i'll try

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,360
and whip through this legislation stuff

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:09,150
because it's a bit boring okay so we

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,130
have the UN Convention of Human Rights

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,759
of Rights with persons with disabilities

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:17,280
sorry recognizes access to the web as a

00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:22,020
right that should be respected a basic

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:25,740
human right so we I think have a really

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,330
strong ethical obligation as people who

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,729
are very empowered who are very savvy

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,500
users of technology to make sure that

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:34,080
other people who might not have the same

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,199
access and the same rights and abilities

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,780
as us are able to to get that access as

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,180
well and there are legislative

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,860
frameworks to support this so I'm

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,930
familiar particularly with Germany the

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,070
UK and a little bit the US but there's

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,530
frameworks in other countries as well

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,539
this doesn't usually apply to the

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,159
private sector but it will apply to

00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,630
government organizations and too many

00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,159
nonprofit organizations that receive

00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:00,080
government funding so it's kind of good

00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,550
to be aware of these basic frameworks

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,630
unfortunately it's quite hard to find

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:08,880
practical examples of how to take this

00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:12,320
legislative framework and the rules and

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,789
the specs and turn it into something

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,820
practical that you can kind of just use

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:19,650
in your everyday workflow and I kind of

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,930
think of this a little bit like maybe

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,300
four or five years ago and you had this

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,099
problem with like two floated divs and

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,539
then the next dave is coming up here and

00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,880
you're like what's going on and then

00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:32,070
you're like ah I need your clear fix get

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,500
down there div do what you're supposed

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,000
to be doing and and there was like this

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,560
kind of whole debate in the community

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,300
how do you achieve this really simple

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,599
layout of like to give thanks to each

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,850
other and one underneath and now we just

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,500
have the CLE fix and if you're like me

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,570
you just like at include feet clear

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,540
fixin and you're done and that problem

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,430
is kind of being solved by the community

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,660
and there's a default kind of

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:59,700
a of just making that work which I don't

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,320
think really exists for a lot of this

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,060
stuff that we're talking about in terms

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,260
of how to make websites more accessible

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,180
so one of the things I'm trying to do

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,440
here today is to give you some kind of

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,420
practical stuff that you don't need to

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,899
think about too much to just apply okay

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,899
so then we come to standards and specs

00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:22,290
w3c of course big bad boss of the

00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:26,430
Internet's they have to kind of relevant

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:28,380
specs that we can use as guidelines for

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:32,850
what we should be doing in our web

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:35,610
projects the first one is I'm going to

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:40,320
say V CAG because I've lived in Germany

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:44,279
for five years I can do that so this is

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,830
kind of an older guidelines and this is

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,720
a set of recommendations for how we can

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,839
go about making the web more accessible

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,180
and it breaks down sorry at a higher

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,360
level we can kind of say it's these four

00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,640
ideas so everything on the web page or

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,370
website should be perceivable okay

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,170
that's fairly clear so you should be

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,650
able to read the text it shouldn't be

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,300
hidden to obscurely or if there's video

00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,290
or audio there needs to be alternate

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,839
content that explains what it's about

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,700
okay it should be operable yeah again

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,890
pretty straightforward we want people to

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,779
be able to navigate around our site so

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,760
you know don't have things where you

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:27,050
click and like the button runs away or

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,830
whatever you know pretty straightforward

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,870
understandable so this is about

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,209
providing user feedback and kind of

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,640
conforming to design patterns that allow

00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:38,279
people to more or less know what they're

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,329
doing and robust so this is about a

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:48,510
forward compatibility and complying with

00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:50,010
standards which we all do anyway so it's

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:54,720
divided into three priority levels and

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:57,149
this WCAG guidelines basically forms the

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,730
the basis for most legislation that's in

00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:06,329
place I will talk about that a little

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,230
bit more so the problem with the WCAG is

00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,080
when you really

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:13,790
going to break down what's going on

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:18,810
there it really is a lot of very very

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:22,680
kind of cross every T dot every I alt

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:24,060
text every image title every link and it

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,550
can feel like it's this incredibly

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,840
nitpicky approach where you just have to

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,570
be focused on all these tiny little

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,340
details and then you just start to think

00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,780
oh my god life I work with the content

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,900
management system or I work with a

00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:38,460
Content team or I there is no way I'm

00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,770
ever going to be able to make sure every

00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,780
single image on my site has an alt text

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,610
description I just it's too much it's

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,490
too hard I'm just going to give up and

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,520
walk away and unfortunately because this

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,450
is sort of underpinning the legislation

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,510
it's tended to be a little bit of a

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,830
turn-off for people so I think there's

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,700
some other ways we can think about that

00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:02,280
which we'll talk about shortly as well

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,760
as the WCAG there's a new standard

00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:08,700
called wa I aria and this is a

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,160
recognition that web pages aren't really

00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,380
just the static documents that Tim

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,590
berners-lee envisaged you know 25 years

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,210
ago we have these really rich Internet

00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:21,300
applications where things are being

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:25,640
updated or filtered or loaded in all the

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:28,230
time and it's very difficult to alert a

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,510
technology like a screen reader that

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,640
something's just changed on the page so

00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,260
if your vision is fine and you're

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,670
looking you can easily see well like

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,580
something just loaded in there there's

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,990
been an update or whatever but if your

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,640
vision impaired and you're reliant on a

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,060
screen reader to basically read through

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,680
the page for you the web page needs some

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,120
way of saying well well well screen

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,080
reader come back up to the top of the

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,930
page there's like important news so WA

00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,280
aria is the kind of a new specification

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:01,140
or relatively new that's trying to

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:04,080
reflect that and allow way basically for

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,730
us as developers to communicate or the

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,020
browser to communicate to assistive

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,800
technologies that something has changed

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,800
on the page

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,000
won't talk about too much I will skip

00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,290
through the German legislation because

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,460
it's quite boring but I will talk a

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,440
little bit about the UK legislation

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,730
because i think the UK has taken a

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,959
slightly different approach which i

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:32,300
think is really really fantastic so the

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:34,399
there is one set of legislation which is

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,080
really based on this WCAG standard and

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,720
that's really like make sure your alt

00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,470
text is there like make sure your links

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,040
have titles you know really black text

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,420
on a white screen thank you but they

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,670
also have this other document called the

00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,290
pas 78 and if you're working on a

00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,670
project where accessibility is an

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,110
important issue I cannot recommend

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,790
enough that you check this document out

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,040
that's it's it's quite short it's like

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,390
20 pages long it's non-technical it's

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,430
intended for a non technical audience

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,130
and the idea is how do you go about

00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:11,779
planning a project for accessibility

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:13,190
from the very beginning and rather than

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,830
taking this really detail oriented

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:19,730
approach what the past 78 encourages you

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:24,740
to do is to say what is the main goal

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:27,470
for users of my website so this is a

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,260
really task oriented approach so if you

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,270
have an event booking website the most

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,520
important thing users on your site need

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:37,130
to be able to do is fill out that event

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,440
booking form if it's in marketing or

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,900
informational website the most important

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,640
thing is that people can read the

00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,459
information and maybe fill out a contact

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,709
form so it's really from the very very

00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:51,200
start of the project identifying when

00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:52,700
people come to our website what action

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,440
do we want them to do what are they

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,630
coming here for and then making sure

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,270
that everybody regardless of ability can

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,160
complete that action so you might have

00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,959
all this like amazing video and audio

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,970
content on your site and it's beautiful

00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:11,630
and it's this really rich user

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:13,730
experience but if ultimately at the end

00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,350
of the day you need to just convey a few

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,040
pieces of information and get someone to

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,440
fill out a form it's okay if you don't

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,290
subtitle all that video and audio it's

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,779
wonderful if you can but really put your

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,029
effort and you focus on your

00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,769
belapur hours in making sure that these

00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:33,699
key goals of the site can be achieved by

00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:35,319
all users and I think what really is

00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,810
wonderful about this is you see that

00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:39,160
there's just such a really strong

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,110
crossover between what is good

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,259
accessibility to sign and what is good

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,639
UX kind of user experience design more

00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,949
broadly they're really not something

00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,649
that's like at loggerheads it's really

00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:52,809
thinking from the ground up how do we

00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:58,089
enable all users of our site to achieve

00:15:52,809 --> 00:16:00,540
what they want to achieve ok cool that's

00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:02,529
the background let's look at some code

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,699
so the first thing we're going to I

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:08,050
wanted to actually show you what a

00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,819
screen reader sounds like but I have

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:14,019
this demo version of the software in it

00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:15,610
it's just a bad day for audio up here so

00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:18,009
maybe I'll just sort of demonstrate for

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:21,370
you who's actually listened to voiceover

00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:24,490
on a mac or yeah a few people okay so

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:27,930
you have some idea of just how kind of

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:30,040
scary and aggressive that voice sounds

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,930
when I first started working on this

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,660
project and started to test I was just

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:36,309
like so horrified and shocked because on

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,959
a page like this what you basically get

00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:41,110
is something like better accessibility

00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:43,180
with JavaScript strict code mo wa I

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:46,059
landmark roles tab index and you're

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:53,649
sorry I'm sorry please don't terminate

00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:54,939
the etch so it's really people who use

00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,079
these screen readers to navigate the

00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:59,050
internet I just have so much respect

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,009
because it's like straw denair alee

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,550
difficult and just this overwhelming

00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:05,230
flow of information coming at you so

00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,630
what we can do is actually make it a lot

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,850
easier so rather than it's just like one

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:13,000
long body of text that just gets read

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:15,069
out in this like huge stream well well

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,720
well where is the actual content of the

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:21,669
page we can start by marking up the

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,730
various areas of our page with these

00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:27,250
things called wa I landmark roles and

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:32,830
this basically tells just going to

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:35,649
scroll down a little bit the screen

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:39,520
reader our voiceover or jaws or whatever

00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:43,060
what the semantic role of

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,340
various parts of the document are so

00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,710
this means that a user is able to

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,450
basically tab from the banner to the

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,400
navigation to the main to the

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,350
complementary to the content info

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,650
without having to read through

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,420
everything every time which is more or

00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,810
less if you think about it how sighted

00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,400
users are also scanning through the page

00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,710
you know you might kind of read the top

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,510
part once you have two or three pages

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,040
into browsing a site you're not

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,380
rereading the navigation every time

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,680
you're jumping straight to that content

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:17,050
area and you're reading from there so

00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,090
using these landmark roles which are

00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,920
basically just attributes that you put

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,510
on you know the containing give or the

00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,200
containing section or whatever you

00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:29,620
wonderful html5 semantic container is

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,020
that you have you're basically just

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,910
marking up the page like this so kind of

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,220
very straightforward very easy to do and

00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:39,700
if you're already using kind of these

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,110
html5 semantic elements then you know

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:49,450
that's kind of just meshes really well

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:52,750
with that next thing that you can do and

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:54,520
this is like really probably like almost

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,590
the most easy thing you can do to

00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,960
improve the user experience of your

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:03,280
pages and that is to give a logical

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:06,490
tabindex to your pages now if you write

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,180
this beautiful from scratch handcrafted

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:13,000
HTML that's like flawless and this

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,740
polished gem of code then I am really

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,050
jealous of you but I work with WordPress

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:22,270
a lot so you time to end up with like

00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,800
content that's being pulled in from all

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,150
over the place and you've got widgets

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,980
and you've got forms and you got this

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:30,760
near that and then they're all throwing

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,740
tab indexes into the content and what

00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,530
that means is if I'm using the tab key

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,270
to basically move between the various

00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,770
elements of the page I'm going to be

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,330
like appear and then I'm down there and

00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,660
then i'm doing a form that I'm over here

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,460
and I don't know what I'm doing so let's

00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,640
take all of that and let's just wipe it

00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,290
back to zero so that when I tab through

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,320
the page and basically tabbing just

00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,560
takes you from one focusable element to

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,170
the

00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,390
X so generally from you know one link to

00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:01,030
the next thing to the next thing then

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,410
I'm going to move through the page in a

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,530
logical order that makes it a lot easier

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,990
for me to understand and really that's

00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:11,260
just this tiny handy snippet of code

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:13,600
here dump it in your in your projects

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,550
and you've just massively improved the

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,730
user experience for a whole group of

00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:20,730
people so it's that easy folks but easy

00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,220
another little useful fragment is this

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,890
one here which is the skip navigation

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,450
link so there's kind of some debate

00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,600
about whether this is still necessary

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:35,980
now that we have these landmark roles

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,440
but you know what I think kind of err on

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,120
the side of caution and supporting

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,060
people who maybe have older technology

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,610
and all this basically is is a small

00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:48,640
link that appears only when you focus on

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:51,880
it and it's just an in page length down

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,800
to the main content of the page so as

00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,750
soon as I press tab and focus on the

00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,240
link I can see it there I can press

00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,910
Enter it will move the focus of the

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,910
screen reader down to the main content

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,980
and will start reading from there but if

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,480
you're a sighted user or you don't use

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,000
the keyboard to navigate the site you'll

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,670
never even know it's there so here's

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,280
just some CSS to show how you can hide

00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:17,280
it yep okay

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:28,320
okay then screen reader text sometimes

00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,780
you want to give a little bit of extra

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,530
information or context to people who are

00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:36,660
using a screen reader so this might be

00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:39,270
for example if you're as we're about to

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,610
see showing a map if you're looking at a

00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:45,350
map this is really obvious to sighted

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:47,580
users it's a map it doesn't necessarily

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,130
come out that way when you're reading it

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,350
with a screen reader or you might have

00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:55,410
something that has some specific type of

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,510
interaction that you have added an extra

00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:00,299
keyboard control so for example to

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:03,090
filtering or to the carousel things like

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:04,320
this so you might just need to give a

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:08,160
little bit of context that's only

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,020
relevant to these users but you want to

00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,330
hide it from sighted users so

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:16,049
unfortunately if you put display none on

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:17,640
something then a screen reader

00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:20,790
technology is kind of smart enough to

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,500
know don't read that bit out so we have

00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:26,970
to kind of do this very convoluted

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,070
little CSS snippet to basically have

00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,570
text that's there in the right place and

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:35,900
will be read out by screen readers and

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:39,080
will be invisible to everybody else cool

00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,160
so they're kind of some just little

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,950
small I mean I really think these are

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,840
small things that you can do that you

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,669
don't require you to like jump through

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,010
all the hoops that you need to get that

00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:52,740
WCAG kind of certification stamp of

00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,480
approval but really are going to help a

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,559
lot of people just have a much much

00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,179
better experience on your site I've got

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,350
a few minutes left so in their final

00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,049
minutes I'm just going to talk a little

00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,330
bit about how or the approach that I've

00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:09,630
taken to adapting some really common

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,880
libraries to just make the experience

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:15,650
for keyboard users and screen reader

00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:18,720
users a little bit better and more fun

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:22,100
so as I said before this is definitely

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,669
not any kind of higher level amazingly

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:29,250
sophisticated code this is like this is

00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:31,000
this is HTML email we're talking people

00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,920
this is like

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,810
you have like all the different

00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,160
operating systems and then how they

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,660
interact with all the different browsers

00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,770
which then interact really differently

00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,290
with all the different screen reader

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,420
software so testing for this and the

00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:48,000
amount of quirks and just undocumented

00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:50,530
bugs it's really a pain and quite ugly

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,970
so this is kind of some hacky approaches

00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:56,730
to sort of making things a little bit

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,730
better which I hope you will find useful

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:06,520
so leaflet is a lovely open-source

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:09,160
mapping JavaScript library I use it a

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,400
lot if you do any kind of database stuff

00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,320
it's really fantastic if you don't want

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,590
to just work with Google all the time

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,280
it's great unfortunately there's some

00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:24,040
problems with how the leaflet library

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,820
works just sort of out of the box so

00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:31,960
that one of the big things is that every

00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:35,080
single one of the image tiles has an alt

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,350
text and that alt text is the latitude

00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:42,340
and longitude of that particular image

00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,900
tile so while you're reading through the

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,100
page and you're like that's great and

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,600
then there's a map and I can see there's

00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,480
a map with some pins and some markers in

00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,460
it if you're using jaws or voiceover

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,090
what you get is blah blah blah blah blah

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:59,680
blah blah 1743 22111 and you're like

00:24:55,090 --> 00:25:01,210
what do I image 17 44 45 any like what

00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,860
why did I just get half an hour of

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:06,280
numbers right out to me in this

00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,010
meaningless stream which is obviously

00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,590
like a really terrible user experience

00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:15,310
so one of the ways I found to kind of

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:16,930
get rid of this was basically to for a

00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,270
start don't know how where you can see

00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,640
the code there but removing all the

00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,860
images which are providing the shadows

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,000
on the markers because they don't really

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:31,090
need to be there and we don't really

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:34,900
need to hear the alt text of shadow we

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:37,390
also want to get rid of what I'm

00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,970
actually doing there yeah so we're

00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,650
setting this this all these other images

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,370
to have the role of presentation and

00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,630
that signals to

00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:49,660
screen readers that this is just here

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:56,800
for looks it's not content so don't read

00:25:49,660 --> 00:26:03,090
it out finally we also have a problem

00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:05,620
where if we are have these markers here

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:09,850
we don't necessarily have a really nice

00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:11,680
kind of logical tab index so in this one

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,390
that I've kind of adapted a little bit

00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,910
what we get here is when we click on the

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:19,590
marker the text inside the marker then

00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:22,600
comes into focus so this tells the

00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,010
screen reader you should now jump like

00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,620
you were going to give focus to this

00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:29,560
attribute and you should start reading

00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,860
out from there then when I press tab I

00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,420
get the close button so this is kind of

00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,920
the opposite of how the leaflet library

00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,210
does it by default and there's sort of a

00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,070
bunch of code there that you can more or

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,100
less copy and paste and dumped into your

00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,140
work if you're interested in using this

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,510
once I close I don't know if you can see

00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,180
the blue kind of square around this but

00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:52,540
my focus comes back to wherever I was

00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:54,550
before I opened that marker so this is

00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,560
just actually making all those kind of

00:26:54,550 --> 00:27:02,140
markers on the page accessible to people

00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:07,990
who are using a keyboard okay three

00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:10,750
minutes and talk quickly about this

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:14,640
carousel so our carousel I mean what

00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:19,240
picky carousel library this is mine I

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,980
like it so this is quite quite easy to

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,870
adapt so that you're also able to

00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:31,240
control it using the left and right keys

00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:32,860
of the keyboard so another thing we sort

00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,430
of did here which I kind of found quiet

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:39,610
nice if I just tab through is that when

00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:42,100
the item comes into focus we actually

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:44,950
then and only then show some additional

00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:49,510
information that's for people who are

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:51,040
navigating using a keyboard so then once

00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,780
this pops up and I can see all this

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,100
comes into focus the only reason why

00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,260
this would come into focus is if

00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,460
someone's tabbing through the page then

00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,559
I'm going to give the

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,010
this ability to control it with the left

00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:04,539
and right arrows and like most carousel

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,090
libraries are going to be exposing some

00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:10,990
sort of previous and next event methods

00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,429
so you can kind of tap into that and and

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:17,460
give that extra layer of keyboard

00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:25,210
functionality I probably don't need to

00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:26,500
look at that in much detail cool I yeah

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:33,490
I'll briefly show that what I do with

00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:35,049
isotope again this is kind of just this

00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,529
is like a really would be an awesome

00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:40,270
case for using this Wa Aria stuff which

00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:42,309
is supposed to kind of alert the screen

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:44,980
reader that there's like changes

00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:46,929
appearing on the page but the support

00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,179
for that is like pachi to non-existent

00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:50,799
right now so maybe in kind of two years

00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:55,090
time you'll be able to basically just

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:56,799
say the role of this kind of area is an

00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,600
application and the screen reader should

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,899
automatically be kind of watching it and

00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,690
checking for changes to the Dom but at

00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:06,520
the moment it's not so we just kind of

00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:10,480
came around to more or less hacking this

00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:13,330
where when you select an element and it

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,799
gets a filter we just show a small kind

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:19,090
of little text here that says three

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,760
items found and focus is like shifted to

00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,340
that so that if you're kind of using a

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,370
screen reader or your arm yeah if you're

00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:29,049
if you need to use a screen reader you

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:31,299
can't see that there's only three items

00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:33,789
that have been found because your vision

00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:36,309
impaired instead we shift the focus to

00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:37,779
hear and provide some other additional

00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:39,669
feedback about what's happened as a

00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:49,590
result of that filtering outcome no

00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:49,590
filtering action okay um lost my slides

00:29:53,820 --> 00:30:02,430
I have 14 seconds 13 but i will speak

00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,890
very briefly about testing testing super

00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:08,790
important do as much as it as you can of

00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:12,320
course functionality testing you know

00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:16,770
there's like as I said pick your battles

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,540
internet explorer but try to test with

00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,340
as much technology as you can it's very

00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,750
enlightening I think just to spend time

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,620
working with this software and just

00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:26,910
seeing how challenging it is to use you

00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,830
know if you're on a Mac it's as simple

00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,650
as just hitting command in f5 and you

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:34,200
can get started straight away if you're

00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:38,280
on Windows like me the only person in

00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:41,460
the room you can download jaws and have

00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,470
a play with that other really really

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,880
useful thing to do is task based testing

00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,190
so this kind of comes back to what I was

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,040
talking about earlier about how you want

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:52,650
to identify user goals and make sure

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,420
people can actually fulfill them so it's

00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:57,300
really awesome if you are able to work

00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,770
with people who are have some disability

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,740
in some way and they're able to give you

00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:04,020
feedback to set them tasks so to say go

00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,000
to this page and make a booking find out

00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,650
this contact information of this person

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,780
and see if they're actually able to

00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,970
successfully complete those tasks or not

00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,290
and then and only then elicit some

00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,820
feedback about like what do you think

00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,710
about the fonts and the colors and blah

00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,540
blah blah because it's very subjective

00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,730
but if someone's able to successfully

00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:24,540
complete a task or not that's really

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:26,220
what you're interested in here so that's

00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,380
my time thank you very much for

00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,500
listening I hope you found something of

00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,500
you

00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,380
