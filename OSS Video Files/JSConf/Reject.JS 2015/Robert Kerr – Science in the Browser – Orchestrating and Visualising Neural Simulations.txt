# Science in the Browser – Orchestrating and Visualising Neural Simulations

Open-science is about making scientific research accessible to everyone, from other scientists to the general public, but often that means just dumping data sets and publishing the researchers’ interpretations. To truly communicate findings and ignite collaboration, we need to expose the tools that the scientists used to analyse the data, simulate the mathematical models, and visualise the results.

As a neuroscientist and a web developer, this is something I’ve been working towards. My talk will show how the old-school, computationally-heavy software used in science can be set free using the centralized power of cloud resources and the ubiquity of the browser. We’ll see real-time, publicly-broadcast, simulations of the electrical activity in brain cells, visualised in 3D using JavaScript.

reject hi everyone I'm really excited to

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:23,550
be here talking to you I've come all the

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:24,630
way from Melbourne Australia so today

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,689
what I'm going to talk to you about is

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,880
how I use the browser to do science I'm

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,099
going to talk about how I use it to do

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,610
my research which involves simulating

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,190
brain cells but I'm also going to talk

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,860
sort of more generally about my

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,329
experiences and thoughts relating to

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,530
sort of the crossroads between science

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:50,760
and web development but first I'm going

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,379
to tell you to origin stories and like

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,690
all good origin stories both of these

00:00:52,379 --> 00:01:00,020
involve science so the first one I think

00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:03,660
probably most you are familiar with is

00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,970
it's the birth of the web so the web was

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,570
created in the late 1980s by Tim

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:13,920
berners-lee at CERN and it was created

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,420
to help scientists do science it was so

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,950
the problem that was happening was that

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,990
there were all these particle physicists

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,580
who would travel discern to do their

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,009
experiments on the facilities there and

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,170
they needed a better way to share and

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,220
access their data when they go back to

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,560
their home home laboratories so as Tim

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,030
berners-lee put it in those days there

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,890
was different information on different

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,090
computers and you'd have to log on to

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,579
these different computers and often have

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,909
to learn a new program to get at the

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,270
data so often it was just easier to to

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,009
meet with the people um over a coffee or

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:55,290
something like that and so he saw the

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:57,600
web as a way to solve these problems and

00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,159
so shortly after that the web spun out

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,600
of the scientific community and became

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,549
what it is today now the second origin

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,220
story I'm pretty confident not many

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,780
people here will know about it's the

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,899
story of how I came to be speaking here

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,899
today

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,730
so like many of you and as Ronald sort

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,650
of pointed out earlier a lot of people

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,410
come from a different area and I'm no

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,450
exception my background is in sort of

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,570
mathematics and engineering and then

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:31,950
went into modeling brain systems trying

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:37,560
to understand how they worked much stand

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:40,200
here so and I was so interested in that

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,940
that I decided to do a PhD in it which I

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,390
don't recommend people get into

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,620
half-heartedly PhDs are hard and it's

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,660
not because you need to be super smart

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,040
or anything like that it's hard because

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,500
you have to stay interested in a

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,760
particular topic for a long time you

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,880
have to be the one driving it forward

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,440
and motivating it you will probably be

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,110
the only one who really fully knows

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,590
what's going on and really cares you

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,810
know if you're successful and this needs

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,670
to be the case for years and because of

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,590
this the end of a PhD is often a time of

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:16,110
stress disillusionment and

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:18,600
procrastination so I didn't make a

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,320
jacket out of tax receipts the way I

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:26,459
procrastinated was instead teaching

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:28,140
myself Ruby on Rails and so I'd like to

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,180
help me learn i decided to build a

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,360
project and so actually built a rhyming

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,090
dictionary called any rom-com so us can

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,830
check that out if you want and I taught

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,209
myself JavaScript as well to try and

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,670
make sort of a nice interface for how

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,980
you could you know make a particular

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,290
kind of rhyme that you wanted so I

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,450
learned angular for that and I found

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,549
myself really enjoying doing this I was

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,110
really satisfying and it's not just

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:57,930
because i had a thesis but I didn't want

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:59,880
to ride but at this point I did

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,989
eventually hand in my thesis and I got a

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,000
job working for IBM Research Australia

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:08,850
still doing euro science research

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,900
believe it or not but at this point I

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,730
now had a taste for for what for what

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,989
the web could do and and I now knew

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,600
about this whole other world of cool

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:22,470
stuff and and maybe this could help with

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,419
my research so before I go any further

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,430
I'll give you some context to my

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,610
research

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,830
so this is the human brain well it's a

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,720
plastic model of human brain it

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,210
represents this hunk of meat that sits

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,699
in our head that is somehow responsible

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,759
for all our memories emotions and

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:44,169
decisions our sense of self and our

00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,340
ability to comprehend the world it takes

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:48,949
information from our senses from our

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:54,110
eyes our ears and our fingertips and

00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:58,580
somehow members this and we can then use

00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:00,139
this information to to speak to move but

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,949
how it does all of this is largely a

00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:05,900
mystery and understanding this is sort

00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:08,930
of the map the fundamental goal of

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,240
neuroscience what we do know however is

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,599
that the brain is made up of a large

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,370
number of cells called neurons in the

00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:18,800
human brain they're approximately 86

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,660
billion neurons and each one of these

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,740
forms 10,000 connections to its

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:28,340
neighbors and it's this dense network of

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,659
neurons that scientists believe is what

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,870
sort of gives rise to the brains

00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:35,210
abilities so if we now just focusing on

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,070
a single neuron we see it has sort of

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,889
this fairly common structure it has

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,139
incoming fibers called dendrites and

00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:44,500
which carry signal to carry a signal to

00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:46,849
the cell body called the soma and

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,970
there's an outgoing fiber called an axon

00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:56,419
which branches and forms connections to

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:57,830
the dendrites of other neurons um but

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,740
despite this basic structure there

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,630
exists a large variety of shapes and

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,070
morphologies for these neurons depending

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,060
on where in the brain our and what type

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:10,310
of neuron now and luckily

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,470
experimentalists have there's an online

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,669
database where you can go through these

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:18,740
different types of of morphologies so

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:22,190
experimentalist what they've done is

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,340
they've taken brain tissue they've

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,830
stained neurons with fluorescent dyes

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,979
they've been taken many many microscope

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,740
images at different depths what they've

00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:35,360
been done is carefully traced well their

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,990
graduate students have carefully traced

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,180
through these microscope images in order

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,949
to

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,680
reconstruct like the 3d information of

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:45,330
the neuron and so you can see here are

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,180
some images of these types of neurons so

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,300
these are just sort of static images but

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,240
what the data actually looks like is a

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,340
text file so each point in here is a

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,340
sort of a point on the neuron starting

00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,520
with the cell body is the first point

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:05,150
each of the points has an ID it has a

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:09,150
type so if it's a dendrite or an axon

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:11,030
has XYZ coordinates and has a radius so

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,160
it gives the thickness of the fiber and

00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,750
it has its like parent point so the

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,210
point going back towards the cell body

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:21,960
and in this way it describes like a tree

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:24,840
structure which is what a neuron is so

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,030
very often in science it's it's

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,160
invaluable to have sort of a visual way

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,280
of looking at your data and this is a

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,500
prime example because it's very hard to

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,090
look at this and understand what's going

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,190
on like what does this neuron look like

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,440
and so I decided to build something that

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,810
would help me look at this so there they

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,409
were existing Java applets and that sort

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,820
of thing to try and visualize this but I

00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,710
wanted to build my own I wanted to use

00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,159
three jess to build something that I

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:59,039
could use so that's what our demo to you

00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,669
now so this is kind of the very basic

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,840
interface I made where I can select one

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:07,169
of these text files that I was just

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,440
showing you and it loads up here and we

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,820
can zoom in and then rotate and so this

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,840
one's a little bit flat but we can see

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:18,360
it has a three-dimensional structure and

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,849
also i can click on points with in here

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,270
and see see the data that generated that

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:27,300
so i can see what type of fiber it is i

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,979
can see the coordinates of it and i can

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:36,539
see its ID so i can link it back to the

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:40,099
data so this is nice I've got like a

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,099
useful tool to help me do my research

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:48,540
but let's put that aside for the moment

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:50,340
and come back to the problems in science

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,750
that Tim berners-lee was trying to solve

00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:58,530
with the web how we doing today how is

00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:01,920
how a science going well the web has

00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,990
helped scientific research a lot we can

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,090
now easily browse through scientific

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,450
publications from researchers around the

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:11,790
world and in addition to these reports

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,870
researchers can share and publish their

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,400
data and code for others to use I can

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,570
point to a number of websites just in

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,280
neuroscience such as neuromorphic org

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:27,780
with carefully curated data sets that

00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:30,060
for other people to use and online you

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,350
can find the software that they've used

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,180
to analyze the data or to run

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,220
simulations and you can download this

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:41,220
and its documentation and forums around

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:42,450
how to use it but is this really that

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,780
different to how things were before the

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:48,960
web I mean it is we can now trivially

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:53,070
share information biet reports data or

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,780
code but all three of these to actually

00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:58,110
use and understand require a high level

00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:01,020
of technical understanding or technical

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,450
expertise what if instead we started

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,920
using and sharing interactive tools to

00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:09,510
help visualize like fully visualize data

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,770
sets interactively without needing to

00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:15,300
install anything what if we could share

00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,530
interactive tools for performing

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,670
simulations that could be run anywhere

00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,350
this I think would be a more complete

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,040
solution to the problems that Tim

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:30,270
berners-lee saw and researchers want to

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,740
be able to to share their results this

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,270
helps them make an impact in the field

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,970
and allows other people to build on what

00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,170
they've done they just haven't had good

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,820
ways of doing this when there was

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,600
specialized software that was required

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,400
for simulation or visualization however

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,870
this is starting to change so recent

00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,990
developments in browser technologies

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,020
like WebGL for instance and new

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,570
JavaScript libraries such as 3gs and

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,970
d3.js make the browser a compelling

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,939
place to build

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:03,869
interactive useful visual scientific

00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:06,809
tools I'd say it's easier now to create

00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:11,220
sort of an interactive scientific tool

00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:14,759
in a browser than it is natively and

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,339
it's much more easily shared so let's

00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,910
get back to me for for a minute I was

00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:24,420
now able to visualize a 3d structure and

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,100
morphology of neurons but so what what I

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,779
actually want to do is to understand how

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:33,269
this neuron works how it behaves and how

00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:36,809
when you connect a whole bunch of these

00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:39,600
neurons up to form a network how this

00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:44,490
ultimately leads to us to our thoughts

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,209
and memories and behavior so let's go

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,670
back to a second to our neuron diagram

00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:52,170
so neurons in the brain communicate with

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,439
each other by sending burst of

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:57,689
electricity called spikes they each

00:11:55,439 --> 00:12:00,360
receive spikes from other neurons fire

00:11:57,689 --> 00:12:04,410
connections called synapses so there's

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,620
one there so when a neuron fires it

00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:11,370
sends its signal out along an axon to

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,749
the end of the axon to the signups where

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,240
the synapse is made on to the dendrite

00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:17,999
of another neuron and it excites our

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,920
this dendrite and we get a small current

00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:23,220
being generated in the dendrite that

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,749
travels down to the cell body and if we

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,329
get enough of these arriving at the same

00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:29,879
time in the cell body and neuron gets

00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,769
excited past a threshold point where it

00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,959
generates its own spike its own burst of

00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:37,949
electricity which it sends out along

00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:40,499
attacks on to other neurons and often

00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:44,339
this whole setup is recreated in

00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:45,809
experiments artificially by positioning

00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,049
and electrode near the dendrite and

00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:50,549
injecting current into the cell and it

00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:52,170
was by doing these sort of experiments

00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:56,970
that two English scientists back in the

00:12:52,170 --> 00:13:01,379
1950s developed a model of how in your

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:03,839
own works so these in experiments

00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,069
involved so this sorry to a mention

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,829
their names Hodgkin and Huxley were the

00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:09,390
two English scientist and they did these

00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,640
experiments by

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,560
using stimulating electrodes like this

00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,590
one and also recording electrodes to see

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,870
what the neuron was doing the neuron

00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,040
they used was the squid giant axon well

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,810
that was that was the accident of the

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,670
neuron they used which is

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:27,950
disappointingly a normal-sized squid

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,950
that has this very large neuron in it

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,800
and it was the size of this neuron that

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,570
allowed them to do these experiments

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,960
even back in the 1950s with the

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:39,360
technology they had and so the

00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,090
understanding they got from this in the

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,830
model they developed off in your on it

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,510
one than the Nobel Prize which they

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,580
shared with another researcher John

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:52,500
Eccles who is actually also from

00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:54,870
Melbourne like me so I don't have any

00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:00,360
code to show today so instead what I'm

00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:01,740
going to show is some equations so the

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,900
model they develop the mathematical

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,750
model developed is is encompassed by

00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:09,120
these these set of equations and even

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:12,240
today this is sort of this type of

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,820
equations are the main ones used to

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,620
model single neurons and this is the

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,990
sort of thing I use so in my models a

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,270
neuron gets divided up into small little

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,580
segments and in each one of those this

00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:26,210
set of equation dictates how the voltage

00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,210
changes over time

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:37,460
so what I wanted to be able to do was

00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:39,380
build a visual tool for constructing

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,390
models of neurons and configuring models

00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,160
in neurons for example I wanted to be

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,080
able to choose where I was going to

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,850
inject current into the neuron and then

00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,589
look at where in the neuron got excited

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,149
or I might want to look at adding

00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:53,990
synaptic inputs from other neurons and

00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,730
look at how the neuron responded so i

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,010
started building an interface to let me

00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,260
do this this was something i spent a

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,300
decent portion of the last year working

00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:07,220
on and it's something that I'm really

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:09,290
proud of my baby so I'm now going to

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,180
demonstrate the interface the first

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,589
thing I'm going to show you is how it

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,540
can be used to sort of set up a

00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:17,029
simulation exactly how you want it so

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,390
set up the inputs and then going to show

00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:21,740
you how it can be used to visualize the

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,020
outputs and see what happened in the

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:29,570
simulation so I'll show you a completed

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:31,220
simulation so jumping back to Chrome so

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,330
this is the interface it's it's pretty

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,380
similar to the one I showed you before

00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,970
you can rotate and zoom in I've now got

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,630
a sphere for the cell body which sort of

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,430
helps a bit so you can see where that is

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,490
one difference now though is I can click

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:49,130
on a section of the neuron and look at

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,080
the properties for that section so I can

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,480
look at the sort of Jim geometric

00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:58,100
properties like XYZ and are but I could

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,870
also look at I can also look at the

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,300
actual electrical properties of the

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,940
tissue so things like channel

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,920
conductances and that sort of thing and

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,320
so I can select for instance multiple

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,400
compartments and I can override the

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:16,670
default value for these and set it to be

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:20,180
something a bit smaller than it was and

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:22,130
I can then go and color the neuron by

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,930
this property so this is this is the

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,550
sodium channel density so how many

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,290
sodium channels are in this part of the

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,339
neuron and this is very important for

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,910
how in your own sort of behaves

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:33,110
electrically so here we can now see for

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,529
different parts of the neuron we've got

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,760
different channel densities so when that

00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,850
where there's the most channels is in

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,000
the soma and along the axon we've got

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,230
less in the dendrites so flying and then

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,540
in this section we

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:50,000
made their be far fewer sodium channels

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:53,690
so it's in dark blue and we can also

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,720
color the neuron by by its radius so at

00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:00,200
my visualization is just a skeleton

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,600
there's no actual volumes but here we

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,910
can see that this neuron has some sort

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,100
of thicker branch sort of going

00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:11,450
vertically through it and thinner

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:14,210
branches coming out switching back to

00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:18,230
that so I can also choose a compartment

00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:20,810
within the neuron to inject current so i

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,660
can add an electrode here and i can

00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,910
choose when I want to inject the can't

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:30,380
for how long the current gets injected

00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:31,310
and the size of the current and so in

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,710
this way I can sort of set up a

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:36,770
simulation run that and then look at how

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:40,010
so let's now look at this is a similar

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:44,030
one I'd set up previously and run so now

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,920
i can click on a compartment and i can

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,670
visualize how the voltage change changes

00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,080
over time through the simulation so down

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,040
here i've built this little graph using

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:58,310
d3 and i can also i can color the neuron

00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,900
by by the voltage so i can now see the

00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,510
voltage at any point within the neuron

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:08,800
over time so we can play forward through

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:08,800
this like a movie i can zoom in on this

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:16,190
and we should see it getting current

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,990
being injected here and the neuron gets

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,360
enough current to produce an action

00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:24,620
potential a spike that travels out along

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,900
the axon and so this is really really

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:30,040
useful to me i can and i can look at

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,040
graphs from different parts

00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:40,560
thank you so yeah this is a really

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,390
useful tool and I plan to start using it

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,880
for my own research to to understand how

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:51,870
in your own works what was going to it

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,760
yeah so I don't know this is an example

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,430
I guess a really accessible tool for

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,400
helping visualize what you're doing for

00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:03,930
making making these sort of simulations

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:07,830
are like very visual so set up so what

00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:10,230
have I learned from this well I've

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:13,350
learned that the web has has a lot to

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,850
offer science and the scientific

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,740
community and I'd really like to see a

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,360
much larger crossover between these two

00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,480
communities I think there's a lot they

00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,850
can learn from each other and to this

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,560
end a friend of mine Isabel and I have

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:29,370
been developing a course for teaching

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,950
researchers in the scientific community

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:39,800
teaching them sort of web skills and

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:42,780
teaching them to use d3.js so here's

00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:45,390
yeah I'll suppose padova cool so here's

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,310
a tweet from Isabel about about the

00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,160
course material we developed so we

00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,540
developed it on github so that other

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,750
people could borrow this material and

00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,700
use themselves and in fact before we had

00:19:54,750 --> 00:20:00,650
the chance to teach this to researchers

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:06,360
at our University someone beat us to it

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:09,270
they in fact ordered at CERN so at CERN

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,630
as part of some summer student web fest

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:15,630
they told our materials around using d3

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:23,010
to visualize your data which is really

00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:27,330
exciting we couldn't believe it so I've

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:29,190
shown you a visual tool for a vigil

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,070
browser based tool for configuring

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:34,410
simulation inputs and visualizing

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:37,650
simulation outputs but the browser is

00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:41,130
sort of only half of the web what we

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:44,610
wanted to do was once we'd set up a

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:46,170
simulation actually then stay in the

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,300
browser and have that simulation get run

00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,070
in the cloud

00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,990
and then pull back the data from that

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:55,350
simulation and stay so still in the

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:58,860
browser seamlessly go through that whole

00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:00,510
transition this would mean so

00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,710
researchers being able to use this tool

00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,290
mean they now no longer have to worry

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:07,440
about moving around files or setting up

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:09,210
or installing any software so this was

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,660
really exciting that's what I wanted to

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:18,020
do so this is the web app sort of i'm

00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:20,820
using now i needed to be able to

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,560
orchestrate simulations and have them

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,040
store their outputs in the cloud where

00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,920
they could be accessed from the browser

00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:31,100
but this is not an easy thing this is

00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,690
not trivial at least it wasn't for me

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,760
luckily though I work with a lot of

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,880
really amazing people who who I could

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,950
learn from him who could teach me also

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,750
the other benefits working at IBM is

00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:45,690
they're acquiring all the companies that

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:49,800
do all this useful cloud technologies so

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:51,870
I could make use of that so I'm

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,210
deploying my app using an IBM product

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,580
called bluemix which is cloud foundry

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:59,340
but it also lets you connect in other

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,870
services so i connect to database to

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,400
keep track of my simulations keep track

00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:05,010
of the data and what state they're in

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,900
whether they're still running but i need

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,990
to actually run their simulations so i

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:14,070
need to run these on virtual machines in

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:15,690
the cloud and as these runs so these the

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,360
simulations are actually run in c++

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,470
inside dr. containers and as they run

00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,630
they need somewhere to put their data

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:24,540
somewhere the browser can get up so I

00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,130
use object storage for this in both the

00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,080
virtual machines and object storage are

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:31,470
within something another IBM product

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:38,340
called called softlayer another recent

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:46,280
acquisition so let's now see all of this

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:49,050
in action so here we were visualizing

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,750
visualizing Apple to this simulation we

00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,460
can actually go back and so here I've

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,610
got a list of other simulations that

00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,830
existed so we were in here so the green

00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,710
simulations are ones that have been

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:03,299
completed have been finished

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,240
in yellow our simulations that we're

00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:08,159
just setting up and haven't yet run and

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,220
so I can make a copy of this one we were

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:15,740
just in so it creates a new one over

00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,970
here and then we go in and so we've got

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,710
this simulation we're just injecting

00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,200
current at one point so we can now go

00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:25,679
and modify this we might want to add

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:29,730
current in it here as well maybe we want

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:36,000
to do that after 90 milliseconds we can

00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:41,100
also inject some current here maybe this

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:46,770
is a 60 and actually this one here I'm

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:48,840
gonna make it a bit stronger and so what

00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:52,230
we can do now is up the top here i can

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:56,490
click a button called simulate and the

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:58,110
state of the jobs changes to running so

00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:01,470
what's happening here is our web app is

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:03,929
sending the job off 22 softlayer to the

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:07,950
vm in software the c++ code is starting

00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:09,450
up inside the docker container and as

00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,279
it's running it will put its data in

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,610
object storage where the browser can

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,929
download it as it's running so this was

00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,200
really cool we can actually watch the

00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:20,669
simulation as it's going on now full

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,020
disclosure I didn't write the superloft

00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:27,750
passcode my boss actually did he kind of

00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,690
insisted he's written this sort of code

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,549
to model how current flows through a

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,850
neuron I think this might be his fifth

00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:36,960
time so he thought he knew exactly how

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,750
it should be done he'd learned from all

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,340
his mistakes but the thing is this is

00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,380
the first time that you can actually see

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:47,399
what's going on as the simulation is

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,049
running so if we click over here we can

00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:52,679
see that some of the results have

00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:54,570
already downloaded and we can color the

00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,779
neuron by these oak like we wear before

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,279
I mean so this line here where you can

00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:02,820
see it stops that's where the simulation

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:09,510
is up to so we can jump back and we can

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:11,130
play forward through here so being able

00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:13,620
to watch this as it's running and and

00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,460
this is all online so other researchers

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,820
can go on and see the models that you

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,470
created see the simulations you've run

00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,330
collaborators now have a like a really

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,480
easy way to share their results and

00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,960
build upon what each other have done

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,250
they don't have to worry about

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,909
installing software they don't have to

00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:32,679
worry about transferring files so I see

00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:37,840
this as an amazing way for collaboration

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:40,179
to occur and moreover it's an example of

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,159
a super accessible way of sharing

00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:46,120
scientific findings that would otherwise

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,730
require specialized software and and to

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:52,539
do simulation and visualization and this

00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,890
is much more accessible like people in

00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:55,960
different fields or even the general

00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,039
public can look at this and and have a

00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,090
much better understanding of what's

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,110
going on and then if they read a journal

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:03,820
paper so I see this is something that

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:11,919
science really needs I see it as like

00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:14,590
the future of science so as the last

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,330
thing so I'm used to giving academic

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,220
talks and at the end of an academic talk

00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:21,399
there's always an acknowledgment slide

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,630
so that's what I've done there's a

00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:26,500
number of people I'd like to thank the

00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:28,720
first person is Glenn Madden so he's the

00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:32,320
one that initially got me into into into

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,539
the web into web development and he

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,710
continues to be a mentor around anything

00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:41,260
web-related the second person is Isabel

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:45,220
Carol Cornick so she's the one that I

00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:48,220
built those d3 course materials with and

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,990
she also provides an endless source of

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,230
feedback for this project and for other

00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:58,450
projects I like to thank Ben Schwartz

00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:59,890
and Carolina sure they were the ones

00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,440
that encouraged me to actually submit to

00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,760
this conference an international

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,440
JavaScript conference which is not

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,010
something i think i would have thought

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,649
of otherwise i'd like to thank IBM

00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:16,360
research and in particular my manager

00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:18,039
who wrote that c++ code for for

00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,110
encouraging me and seeing the value in

00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:22,720
this work and also all the other amazing

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,279
people i work with that IBM who taught

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,159
me a lot of the skills I've needed to do

00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:28,840
this lastly I'd like to thank the

00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,090
organizers of rejecters

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,630
for for inviting me and for being

00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:36,960
awesome and all of you so thanks for

00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,960
