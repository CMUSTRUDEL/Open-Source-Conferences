# Get your hands dirty – play with hardware!

Powerful computation, cheaper electronics, increased connectivity and the steadily lowering of barriers to entry to prototyping and production are propelling a new hardware revolution. And you can be part of it. JavaScript might just be your ticket to this amazing ride.

In my talk I’ll walk you through the rapidly evolving technological stack that allows regular web developers like us to do amazing stuff. Stuff that was the sole realm of electronic engineers and embedded developers just 10 years ago.

To put all this into context, I’ll bring Felix along to Berlin. Felix is my small quadruped pet robot who wants to be (Boston Dynamics’) BigDog when he grows up.

Transcending the virtual world is a powerful experience. Turning on an LED with software you just wrote feels like a Promethean endeavour.

After this talk you will have no excuses not to get your hands dirty and start playing with hardware.

reject yeah good morning my name is rana

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,310
jaramillo and I'm developer and Omega

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,800
and I will spend the next 30 minutes

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,720
trying to convince you that you should

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,670
get your hands dirty and start playing

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:33,000
with hardware I believe that disruptive

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,360
technologies change society and we can

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,129
drive the change in different directions

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,309
for instance the web can be a really

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:44,700
nice place in a great place but it's not

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,530
only the technology behind it but it's

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,469
the culture that would manage to build

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,680
around it especially if it's is a

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,090
culture the value openness transparency

00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:00,719
collaboration diversity and creativity

00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,910
mmm and we are now moving into the

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,369
future where applications will be

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,930
connected and driven by sensors rather

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:12,869
than by user input and computing will be

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,250
everywhere and on everything and we need

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:19,409
to start thinking about what kind of

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:22,380
values we want in this new space and why

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:27,330
I'm talking to you well this is a Venn

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,670
diagram by brand initial and as you can

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,470
see there is a large set of people who

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,400
knows you have a script it small set of

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:39,780
people who know C C++ and a large set of

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:43,770
people with awesome ideas and we need

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,350
more awesome you know about software and

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,540
you know about networks but we all need

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,640
to learn more about hardware not

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,700
necessarily because you will be building

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,439
products but we need to know enough in

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,590
order to dream about the possibilities

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,030
and think about what kind of future we

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:05,670
want my talk would go like this first a

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,170
bit about my background then why I think

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,349
now is the right time to start tinkering

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,480
a question about hardwood and you have a

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:14,750
script

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,800
where you should start and at the end

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:23,069
fallax here we'll do a bit of walking

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:26,190
and i'll do some show-and-tell i was

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:28,160
born in 73 the same here these three

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,420
characters first were introduced

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,760
probably a lot of you don't know who

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:38,790
they are or what they are but during my

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,890
childhood they fuel my life on

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,640
fascination for technology and robots

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:47,130
and still to this day they shake my tree

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,850
may interest in exoskeletons and

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:54,570
prosthetics and androids in all that

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:58,260
sort of stuff my early teens my biggest

00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:00,560
wish was a hero one robot kit and it

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,060
probably cost it an arm and a leg

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,530
because my parents got me a dremel

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:12,870
instead and they told me that I could be

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:15,690
my build my own and this started a life

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:21,920
of tinkering and working with mechanical

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:26,100
contractions and much the same way I

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,959
wanted a Terry game console and my

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,920
parents they bought me an atari st

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,290
computer and that got me into coding and

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,329
we'll really got me hook was the first

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,739
time i was able to control pixels on the

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:44,370
screen and even though i was into tech

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:48,980
and software I didn't went to

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:51,810
engineering school writing passes and

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,440
optimizing sorting algorithm wasn't my

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:58,980
idea of fun so I went to art school and

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,130
did architecture and industrial and

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:05,370
graphic design but still in high school

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:08,670
I keep coding and doing small projects

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:13,530
and got a part-time job with multimedia

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:20,150
development and in this agency the web

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:23,180
exploded and suddenly I became a 1 pixel

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:27,009
gift table ninja

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:31,990
and we were churning out small web apps

00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:35,240
even though this agency had serious

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,850
software developers but they were busy

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,610
doing custom desktop applications for

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:44,199
enterprise they didn't want to have

00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:48,530
anything with the web five years laters

00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:51,770
all this sort of custom development was

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,750
done on top of a lamp stack as web

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,940
applications and the developers that

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,940
didn't embrace the web they were gone a

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:04,039
show of hands out of curiosity how many

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:15,919
of you has another background but

00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:20,690
software engineering okay nice the in 94

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,639
Paul Milgram described in a paper this

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:28,330
space we now call the Milgram continuum

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:31,190
at this is a place were this is a mix of

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,320
the virtual environment and one side and

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,479
the real environment on the other side

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,300
and technology is quickly filling this

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:40,699
space up and the thing is that each

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,729
major technology converging in this

00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:46,729
space right now hardware software and

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:50,300
connectivity has previously had a huge

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:51,620
impact on its own so there is no limit

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,620
to the amount of how you're currently

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,740
seeing based on the spected implications

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,500
of this development for some of this

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,110
technology media and industry has coined

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,210
this label IOT or Internet of Things and

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:09,919
probably you already can't find the term

00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:11,599
in a bingo card and why I think

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,889
that you can get a foothold in this

00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:18,229
space well there is a trend where

00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:22,960
hardware is undergoing a democratization

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:26,659
process and this process is driven by

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,960
different forces but I will highlight

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:33,419
three open hardware component ization

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:36,580
and rapid prototyping

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:40,210
let me ask again how many of you have

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:43,030
heard about Audrina's epidermal chippers

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,100
good well adrenals are the best thing

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:50,290
coming out of Italy since life's pizza

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:55,270
it was born as a platform for

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:57,190
prototyping Amy primarily at designers

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,120
with no background background in

00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:04,570
electronics or programming and their

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,669
decision to release the blue brains with

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,850
a Creative Commons license change the

00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:14,169
industry that on to that point was sort

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:15,490
of clothes and very proprietary today

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:18,430
there are thousands of platforms

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:20,639
available for physical computing that

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,900
takes the messy details of

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,260
microcontroller programming and wrap it

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,300
up in a easy-to-use package one project

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,800
and very excited about is the tehsil two

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:37,960
coming in november and they they managed

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:40,030
to pack and node.js in the on the board

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,000
and they have to sniff the architecture

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:49,870
of clock and play where each component

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,099
has a corresponding npn package so let

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,810
me ask how many of you have actually

00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:57,190
played with an arduino oh that's nice so

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:02,020
I'm preaching for the claw I can see

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:04,900
well the first time I I got to turn an

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,700
LED on and off with an Arduino it with a

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,860
very special feeling it was sort of the

00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,580
same feeling I that that got me into

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,919
programming for the first time and the

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,870
things that code for ascending from bias

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:22,840
to the physical realm is a very powerful

00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:24,880
experience and the next aspect i will

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,740
talk about its component ization which

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:32,080
i'm not really sure it's a proper would

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:36,240
but picture what the NPM is doing for

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,969
the know Jason ecosystem but then thing

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,290
translated to hardware if your project

00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:47,110
need a GPS positioning or take pictures

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:51,910
or biometrics on

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:55,240
or any kind of sensing or communication

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,269
like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi well there is

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:03,279
probably a component for that and these

00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:04,990
components they take care of things you

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,420
don't need to think about internals or

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,839
the circuitry you just add it to your

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,029
project pluck it and import libraries

00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,459
and you're good to go and their

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,620
companies companies like Adafruit and

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:20,579
sparkfun and pollute I have you covered

00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:24,850
they have a lot of amazing stuff and

00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:28,230
also tutorials it used to be like it

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:32,560
when you need a component you have to

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:34,570
read a spec sheet and out of that find

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,300
out how things work but today you really

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,220
have a lot of help adafruit they

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,680
themselves say jokingly that they are

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:47,500
not a hardware company they are a

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:49,899
tutorial company with a gift shop the

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,089
third aspect I will talk about is rapid

00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:57,310
prototyping 3d printers and laser

00:09:54,089 --> 00:10:00,490
cutters and CNC machines they are

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:03,190
becoming much more accessible today you

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,529
can get desktop models of all these

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:09,579
machines and they're within the reach of

00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:12,850
individuals and the number of fab labs

00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:16,839
and maker spaces around the world keep

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:21,220
greeting at the same time the software

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:24,459
to manage this machine is becoming it's

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,829
constantly improving and cat system used

00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:29,620
to be really expensive and now they're

00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:31,750
becoming a commodity the latest

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:37,089
generation of this software is

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:38,740
cloud-based and collaboration and

00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:43,420
versioning is at the core of these

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:46,000
packages so how is this relevant yep I

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,149
could persone personally I can tell you

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,820
that the first iteration of fellig's

00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:56,829
looked like that it was a one-off made

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:59,380
in my shop and made of aluminium it you

00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:01,030
need tooling and precision and it's easy

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,510
it's difficult to update

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:06,430
and it's difficult to share simplifying

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:12,900
the default the design and going

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:16,450
digitally I can create much much cleaner

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:19,660
hardware which is easy to reproduce easy

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,400
to update and easy to share so what's

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,010
powerful about these machines and

00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,200
software and software systems is that

00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:31,930
they allow you to share physical designs

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:34,390
the same way that we share code so

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:38,800
what's about with JavaScript and

00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:43,620
hardware the embedded system used to be

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:47,950
programmed with low-level languages and

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:52,630
they still do mostly but thanks to some

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:59,680
badass developers we have alternative in

00:11:52,630 --> 00:12:01,960
JavaScript and Johnny 5 is a JavaScript

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,910
programming framework that allows you to

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:08,740
control a rich variety of hardware and

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,620
but to be honest the first time I heard

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:20,200
about your script and hardware I was

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:21,760
like hmm but I after playing with it I

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,820
actually found out that this is not a

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,210
case of what as we can from do in

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:31,990
javascript you don't need to clutter

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:34,150
your code with pooling you can add an

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,600
event least attack an event listener and

00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:40,150
wait for the call this is because and

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,780
and the thing that hard work being a

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:47,740
band base and a synchronous by nature

00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:52,600
make it a really good March then we have

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:56,020
the prototypes which provide a required

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,780
flexibility to create some very neat

00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,400
abstraction layers to hide some of the

00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,040
underlying complexity of all this

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,620
hardware and Johnny 5 takes great

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,170
advantage of all these I can illustrate

00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,200
with an example there are a number of

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,300
components you can use to measure

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,080
distance and

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:19,839
all of these components they have their

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,899
own way of speaking with the

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:30,930
microprocessor they can be sound base

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:35,079
light base or lasers and JavaScript

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:37,630
johnny-five wrap it up in a proximity

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:42,180
class and it can looks like and it looks

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:46,980
like this in phallic see I have a sharp

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:49,870
sensor this is a infrared sensor and the

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,800
code to manage it is quite simple you

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:56,200
get Johnny Five and you instantiate a

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,440
board when the board is ready you

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,380
instantiate your component and you tell

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:07,000
the component if the distance to you

00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:10,690
make sure change please tell me and say

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,800
I got the present for christmas i got a

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:16,329
light a light laser component the only

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,790
thing i have to change is the name of

00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:25,500
the controller that's that's quite

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:29,140
powerful and so in the same way that

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,230
jquery sort of abstract the document

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:38,040
object model Johnny Five is taking care

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:38,040
of all this underlying hardware for you

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:46,660
yeah well well you well you can't get

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:49,420
started you can get some toys I will

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:52,899
recommend that you get a star kid there

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:55,660
are a lot of start kids that came come

00:14:52,899 --> 00:15:01,779
with an assortment of sensors and

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:05,140
actuators and then you get 25 and start

00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:09,850
playing with the examples besides the

00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:11,890
community Johnny Five has really good

00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,949
thing going for it is the documentation

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:16,959
and for each example you get this nice

00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:21,370
diagram showing how you you can wire

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:26,380
everything up and then get this book is

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:29,110
a it's not only about robotics a

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:32,860
there are some neat projects wearable

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:37,270
projects and also IOT project they would

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:39,550
sort of learn you gives you some best

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:44,380
practices and ideas of what you can do

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:46,600
what's possible in this space but don't

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:51,460
lock you need to lock yourself in a room

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:53,890
and hide away and start tinkering you

00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:57,400
can join the community you can join a

00:15:53,890 --> 00:16:00,460
node BOTS event there are events and

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,590
meters around the world if there is no

00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:06,460
meet up close to where you live you can

00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:09,910
consider starting your own chapter you

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:13,270
can join a fab lab or make a space how

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:18,040
many here are members of makerspace or

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:20,770
fab lab that's not much well really

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,120
consider it you will meet people doing

00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:25,120
stuff with the hands it's really

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,220
inspiring and probably you be the only

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,200
one around who really understand

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:39,420
programming and you will be treated like

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:46,330
a wizard so I'm into robotics I like

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:48,970
four legged robots the current state of

00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:52,650
the art is represented by person

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:56,740
dynamics they have spot which is a

00:16:52,650 --> 00:17:01,470
electric four-legged robot and big dark

00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:06,970
which you probably have seen that a

00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:10,089
hydraulic engine power gas power beast

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:13,990
they can run they can jump that's a

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:17,770
mighty cheetahs and they can take a

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:23,650
beating but there is a still a long way

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:26,050
to go that's Daisy and I've been working

00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:30,040
on a four-legged robot for some time

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:33,670
it's called Felix and my goal was to

00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:38,560
create a simple and cheap lake robot the

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:40,210
kids out there tend to be a complex and

00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,909
use a lot of servers

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:49,899
and actually I think that kind of creepy

00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:53,710
and my goal was to create a robot with

00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:56,320
eight servers and the challenge

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,840
challenge there was to explore the types

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:05,309
of gates that were as possible with only

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:09,429
eight degrees of freedom the system

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:12,309
space um in adrenal you know I have a

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:19,270
server control chip some sensors on the

00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:24,220
adrenal we have free matter which live

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:29,289
as firmware and the fermata talks to

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:32,890
join a 5-over socket our air all over

00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:37,899
the serial port on top I'm using spray

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:42,010
CS and socket i/o to provide the UI so

00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:46,120
when you have to learn to get a

00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:51,240
four-legged robot walking you need where

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,240
there are three steps or you need 3 a 3

00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:58,990
parts of your code one part will be

00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:01,990
dealing with the position of of your

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:05,460
feet because you don't want to deal with

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:09,659
the rotation angles you just want to

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:14,110
decide where you place the foot and then

00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:17,230
calculate the angles using trigonometry

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:22,149
and then you want to do some motion

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:24,340
planning like how is your step going to

00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:28,630
work you have a track you have a lift

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:36,820
and then you combine these motions into

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:41,279
gates mmm now will do fellas will do a

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,279
bit of walking and

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:59,330
I think he's better can you see him is

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:59,330
cease on the floor is possible team

00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:27,759
and you can see this sensors they map

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:29,529
the distance and tell him not to bump

00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,599
into anything there's a lot of light

00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:36,190
here so he's quite confused as you can

00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:46,179
see but let's see if he managed to do

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:51,819
some walking speak enough again the UI

00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:57,699
is talking is talking to the Arduino

00:20:51,819 --> 00:21:02,909
using socket i/o and this is a creeping

00:20:57,699 --> 00:21:06,219
gate I can tell him to walk forward stop

00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:08,469
sort of go backward you didn't want to

00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:11,559
go backward you're a bit not no I didn't

00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:15,279
want it you know well he still has to go

00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:18,429
forward he can turn around the thing is

00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:24,190
that because he doesn't have the right

00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:28,959
number of a mobility in the car sir he

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:32,799
is constrained so when he when he wants

00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:36,940
to turn what he does is that he take

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:43,640
small step steps with the lake at that

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:50,190
side he wants to turn to and he can sit

00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:53,220
and he can day and he has also another

00:21:50,190 --> 00:22:15,950
gate which is the trot which is sort of

00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:15,950
a weird tapping dance let me so

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:37,430
and this is the little brother it's

00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:44,330
using a smaller servos with not much

00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:49,400
torque and the idea is to develop this

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:52,970
into kids that you can play with with

00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,730
children or all the people at least in

00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:58,340
the hackerspace kids really like to play

00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:03,970
with this stuff because you can use the

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:06,550
sensors to for instance he stops when

00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:09,200
there are obstacles in front and

00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:14,960
actually I haven't learned him that he

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:23,690
shouldn't go there so I go back to my

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:27,560
talk see there are some links to all the

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,270
resources available check out the Tesla

00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:37,940
I would recommend it take out Johnny 5

00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:40,060
to get you started and go on play thank

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,060
you

00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,310
