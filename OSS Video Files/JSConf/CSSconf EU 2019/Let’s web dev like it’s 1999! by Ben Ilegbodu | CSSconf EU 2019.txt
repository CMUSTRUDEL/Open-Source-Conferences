Description: 
	In order to build our beautifully designed apps with sophisticated interactions, we leverage the latest features in HTML, CSS and JavaScript available in our modern evergreen browsers. However, when web development was in its infancy two decades ago, things were drastically different. Sites had hit counters, used frames for navigation, and were updated manually via FTP. We used the blink tag and scrolling marquees! Let’s walk down memory lane (or have a history lesson) and have some laughs cringing at how sites looked, how they were built, and the rudimentary tooling we had to develop them.

	alright gutentag CSS cough alright Ilearned that in the taxi ride thismorning so that's all I knowbut welcome everybody from lunch who'sstill coming back from lunch this talkis called let's webdev like it's I actually have a question for everyonehere can you raise your hand if you weredoing web development back in your hand if you're doing it back thenokay all right a small handful actuallyokay so that's good so I'm hoping toshare a little bit about my developmentstory and kind of walk us down memorylane those of us who were doing it backthen but for most of you here I guessit'll be you know a history lesson forall of you about what we had to do backthen so I'll kind of sit back and takeit in and hopefully I will learn somenew things along the way as well and wecan appreciate kind of where we arebased upon where we've come from so theslides that I have for the talk they'reavailable online so I have a link at thebottom of my slides there you couldfollow or if you go to my Twitterprofile at been MVP I've tweeted out alink to the slides as well okay so nowif I can get everyone to stand up I wantto get everyone to stand up okay so wejust had lunch and it's gonna startdigesting and you're gonna feel thisurge to fall asleep during my talk okayand I don't want you to do that okay sowhat we're gonna do together is we'regonna do and I want you to count it out with meand if you don't want to or if you can'tyou don't have to you can just do yourarms but kind of join along with me okayso here we go ready three looking great for five halfwaythere six keep going seven yeah you'refeeling it noweight nine and ten wonderful jobeveryone a great job great job[Applause]all right so just a little bit aboutmyself like I said my name is Ben a legBadu I'm a Christian a husband and afather this is a picture of my family welive in the San Francisco Bay Areathat's my wife Rashida we've beenmarried for almost nine years now wehave three kids oh yeah you can give hera clap yepI'll let her know I'll let her knowawesome we have three kidsmy oldest daughter she's five going onfive and a half Simone she's at thebottom there and then our middledaughter she's two and a halfAvery and then our youngest son he isfour and a half months old so he wasjust born in January so I'm a principalfront-end engineer at Eventbrite and Iwork on a newly developed team calledour data and recommendations team we'rekind of focused on providing insights toevent creators like the organizers thatcreated this conference giving theminsights to help them be even moresuccessful sell more tickets and thingslike that I'm also a huge basketball andNBA fan yes NBA so now I'm missing theNBA Finals that just started yesterdaylast night so I know who won andeverything like that I'm gonna miss onSunday but I think this is yeah this wasa better idea to come here and sharewith you also I'm not sad or anythinglike that I'm happy to be here I'm gonnalet you know but I don't want to talkabout me now I want to talk about me years agookay and it started off I learned myfirst programming language basic in thesummer of high school and I usebasic the programming language to startprogramming or building apps for myti-school for my I started building mathprograms mainly and I would createprograms to what I said I I checked myhomework and I check the answers to mytests with my apps that I would build soI'll build a slope calculator orwhatever I was doing an algebra geometryjust plug in the numbers and it wouldgive me the answer and I would verifywhat I did so I figured if I was able tobuild the app it wasn't cheating atleast that's what I told myselfso then I wanted to find a way to teachothers how they could build their appsprogram as well because people wereasking me how they could do thatso naturally I created a website and Ihave to go to the wayback machineactually to find it it isn't it is verybeautiful as you can see here I'mtotally a designer it was called basicguru online because apparently I was aguru at the age of and it's hosted on geo cities for any ofyou all from back then geo cities islike the service there was also angelfire and tripod but like geo cities waslike the main one I'm I'm talking likeearly application but basic guru online and Iupdated it basically by pushing staticfiles static HTML CSS files likedirectly to their servers with FTP justlike from my computer to their serversand and they handle all the backend andsuch so looking at the top I definitelymade the logo in Microsoft Paintusing a clipart from PowerPoint and Iused Comic Sans because Comic Sans solike just come out that time and it wassuper duper popular then everything wasin Comic Sans and then in the middlethere I have my you know trusty hitcounter that everyone had on their sitesback then as wellapparently it was broken now but I hadyou know tens of thousands of hits sinceAugust some reason I thought it was a good ideato show the current date for some reasonthough that was a good idea but it stillworks like the reason why javascript is backwardscompatible so that's someone later their website could still workwhich is awesome and then at the bottomin the middle of all this text that youhave to read I mentioned that a well theAOL browser is the preferred browser toview the site but it should be okay andin an explorer and Netscape Navigatorokay this is how old it was best viewedand further on on the right again I havethis Internet poll about connectionspeed internet connection speed I wish Ihad the results of what they were butyou know dial-up was a thing back thenand then at the bottom was this bottomframe and it was this fixed heightbottom footer I guess so the main windowwould scroll and then it would just befixed at the bottom and I'll talk alittle bit more about how that allworked so but surprisingly and all thisI never used a scrolling marquee or ablink tag or anything like that I'mpretty impressed with my younger self sojust for fun this is what Yahoo lookedlike at the time and if you look if youcan look at the very bottom it sayspowered by Compaq which was funny andthen this is also amazon.com as well andif you look at the bottom it saysMicrosoft XP is now shipping yes okayso but before cssneeded ways to layout our pages okay andmany times we would have some kind ofnavigation that we wanted fixed eitherit's a fixed header at the top or youhave your left nav or in my case Ithought it was a good to have a bottomnav fixed at the bottomand we needed ways to be able to buildthat now you may be thinking that I'mtalking about tables right a table bestlayout but no I'm talking aboutsomething that comes even before a tablebased layouts and I'm talking aboutframe set yeah all these old people likewhoa frames said I remember frame setsyes okay so for those of you I'll getinto what frame sets are in a little bitbut take a look at this HTML code that Ihave here like it's in all caps likeback then we decided we wanted to screamevery time we were writing our coderight and we had attributes like marginheight and frame border like we're noteven quoting those we're just puttingthe numbers right after the equals signand like take a look at the frame tagslike they're not even self closing likeI don't know how the browser figuredthat out like that's amazing the web wasjust crazy back then but so this is thelayout that we're actually buildingright now it's kind of this contrivedexample that I want to show so onceagain we have a frame at the top andthat's fixed and then we have threeframes beneath it and the one on theleft is uh it is frame - and that'sfixed the one on the right is frame fourthat's fixed and then in the middleframe three just has it can be variablewidth depending on the size of yourwindow it's okay let's go back to thecode now so starting off we have thisframe okay and the frames actuallypointed to specific HTML pages like youwould actually have a HTML documentcalled header hand then the frame set itself allows youto align things either by rows or bycolumns and they can even be nested soyou can have a frame set inside of aframe set and take a look at thisasterisk you know syntax here whichbasically says that the column in thiscase will take up the remainder of thespace which is actually pretty fancy forago right that it could just be fluidthat way and of course there's visualstyling that's mixed up in the markup aswell so frames by default had bordersaround them so you could add frameborder zero to turn off the frames thatway but if you left on the borders theborder the borders could be dragged andresized so you could turn off thatattribute with the no resize attributethere to prevent resizing and and thenlast but not least we have thisthis name attribute they're like whatexactly is the name attribute for it'spointing to content again with with noquotes it's pointing to content so letme explain how that worked so inaddition to you know wanting thisgrid-like layout we also didn't want torefresh the entire page every time wenavigate it around right so we knew theheader was gonna stay fixed we knew thenav on the left was gonna stay fixed soinside of the nav we were able to saywhen I click on something that thecontent would actually change so we'realways all used to saying you knowtarget equals underscore blank to openup a new window unless the only time weever use the target attribute wellthere's actually other reasons to usethe target attribute or lease therethere were other reasons to use thetarget attribute and that was the targetother frames in order to update theircontent so in this case when you clickon the link the main content wouldupdate with whatever link we had andalso for some reason the Allies weren'tclosed then either maybe that'ssomething we did or something I did Idon't know but Li tags were just openand by the way frame set was deprecatedin htmluse anymore but all the browser stillseem to support it so I guess you couldgo off in and go old-school now but ifyou've been able if you've been keepingup with everything going on in CSS landright what I just described sounds verysimilar to CSS grid which Rachel showedus earlier and we can basicallyaccomplish the same thing with framesets as we can with CSS grid with thiscode here so I'm not going to go throughthe code that's not really the purposeof this but you know notice how the themain tag is actually above the nav tagso that's for SEO purposes of course sothat the main content which is moreimportant can show up first but then thegrid layout allows us to put thingswherever we want whether it's smallscreen large screen so that it candisplay the way that we like it okay butyou know what CSS grid it's way way waytoo modern for us so let's go let's goback to decadesagain okay so let's say we have thisschedule right that's the schedule forthe CSS coffee you to today and like all we want to do is justindent the name of the speaker in from the left so naturally we woulduse some CSS selector like margin leftwhatever the case may be we have so muchat CSS at our disposal to be able tomake it happen so it's simple enoughrightor maybe we would use bootstrap of gridsystem and we would burn a left columnor something sophisticated like that butwe would leverage CSS but what do you dowhat do you use when CSS doesn't existyet or at the very least you're not surethat CSS is going to exist in all thebrowsers where your sites gonna be wellyou would use a as a spacer gifyes and I say gif not Jeff okay so ifyou say jiff too bad but what it was itwas like it was this hundred percenttransparent see-through image okay andit was teeny in size because it isactually create our pixel perfect spacing and ourpixel perfect layouts before CSS existedso it could work in the horizontal orvertical direction you would just takethegive it a whiff or give it a height orgive it both and you're able to spacethings and give things margins andpadding's and separate things howeveryou wanted and we used them like allover the place all over the place andagain a responsive design wasn't a thingat this time so we were just designingfor like one screen width or whatever sowe didn't have to worry about mobile sowe would just use and for this you know maybe you couldthrow a whole bunch of non-breakingspaces as well which I totally didnumber of times as wellbut for this specific case you knowspacing with non-breaking spacesdepending on the font and the font sizeso things may not line up exactly howyou would want to use them so spacergifts were definitely at our disposalokay and then CSS became a thing whichwas great so we're talking early great we have some CSS we can use ityou've got HTML and we have CSS this isgonna be awesome so what could we do sono longer did we have to put text orlink or background colors on the bodytag anymore or no longer do we have touse the font tag for styling everythinglike the font tag is like obsolete it'snot deprecated it's just like gone fromthe browser's now and I definitely usethe font tag like everywhere I want itto style something I want to makesomething red font tag I wanted to makesomething bigger font tag I wanted tomake something have a background fonttag everywhere everywhere everywherefont tags didn't use spans always fonttags so we do have to do that anymore wewere still using tables obviously forlayouts of course but no longer did wehave to have the styling for the tablein the markup anymore we could put it ina separate file because we had CSShowever you know what we ended up usingCSS the most for or at least what Iended up using CSS the most for in thebeginning it wasto screw with links okay and the defaultlink styling so I could make the defaultlink color like different and without anunderline like whatand like visited links of course we'redifferent they're always purple for somereason so I could make them the samecolor now and undo that and the bestpart was is that when I hovered over thelink I could change the color and thenadd an underline like look how dynamicthat is like you guys are looking at menow like what's the big deal but man years ago being able to do that likebeing able to add that dynamism wasamazing because at the beginning CSS wasonly just for taking the styling out ofthe markup we didn't have all of thefancy transitions and flexbox and allthe different properties that we havenow to create you know sophisticateddynamic layouts all we had was just aseparation of styles so be able to messwith links was like the coolest thingthat I could do at that time ok so thenmoving on there's this there's this campof people right who believe that CSS isso easy right so so easy then there'sthis other camp over here that believesthat CSS is like so hard that we shouldjust move all of our styling intoJavaScript right and do CSS nsj rightand I'm not trying to get in the middleof that war on stage for sure but years agodebugging styling was actually a pain itwas really difficult and because therewas no easy way to know what the browserwas rendering or even to know whatclasses was actually being applied likeif I wrote a CSS class is it actuallytargeting this Dom element or aspecificity rules colliding or what'sgoing on and it was compoundingcompounded by the fact that the sizingof elements the layout of elements thez-index issues like I didn't know whatwas going on so would always throw ondummy colors or add dummy border colorsjust to see what was going on in themarkupand and to see kind of what the boundingboxes were it was basically like consoledot log of CSS at that time and ofcourse in order to do this right I'dhave to make the change in my editorprobably notepad make the change in myeditor save it reload the browser seethe results pull out my hair because Ihad hair back then pull up my hair wishstackoverflow existed and then changesomething and try to see again right andthat was the iterative loop that we hadback then and then Firebug came alongand like mid changed the game like this was rightaround when I started developing likefull-timehaving Firebug and I don't know how manypeople have heard of it but it was anextension of Firefox initially before itbecame embedded in the browser and itgot me to actually move from InternetExplorer over to Firefox at the timethis was before chrome existed and Icould actually like see the CSS in thebrowser and make changes to it I coulddebug the javascript in the browser likecompletely completely revolutionary andI think it actually paved the way forall of the amazing kind of web style applications that came afterwardsbecause we were able to debug and seethings happen in such real time thatenabled us to do bigger and betterthingsso huge Aang and Jason they kind ofshowed us all the benefits of dev toolsright earlier today that have evenallowed us to go even further than thatand now Firefox lets you inspect thegrid that we're writing and the Flex boxthat's there or a firefox allows us toinspect the fonts like all of these arejust kind of mind-blowing we didn't haveany of those things back then and thesedays we have so much tooling dev toolingto make our lives even easier right toensure that we're not shipping brokencode because in the past like I said wehad our desktop computer you made thechanges and then you just FTP that youjust put itthe server right and we basically wereworking directly on the server and wouldalways break all sorts of things likeone dangling comma would just completelydestroy the site but now our code goeslike on this incredible journey beforeit even gets to production right like wehave editors like vs code that makewriting code so much easier because ithas a tell isense and it can warn youfor typos and selectors all theseextensions that make a coding easier andwe have github which is like tablesticks now like having via github but wedidn't have version control back then orat least only the big companies hadversion control and imagine like twopeople trying to work on the sameproject FTP and Co just directly onto asite like it's just madness how we wereable to make all that stuff run and thenthere's of course there's gulp right andI've labeled us to write build scriptsto transform our SAS and to minifiedoptimize CSS like I remember having towrite terse CSS with like no spaces allon one line in order to make sure thatmy CSS was as small as possible becausewe didn't have other things likeminifiers to to change our CSS I had afriendactually who was working at AOL at thesame time and they weren't allowed towrite any comments and any of their CSSand any of their JavaScript because itwould make the CSS even bigger likenothing just write the code and thenwe've got Travis of course that givescontinuous integration environment so wecan automatically kick off builds withgit commits and they could run tests andeven deploy automatically to productionand we have services like net laugh Ithat even allow us to preview our PRSnow even before they're merged so we cansee what this CSS has done we can seewhat the JavaScript is done even beforeit lands and even before we merge it inso um quick question actually before Ifinish another question how many peoplehere have been in the industry beendeveloping for two years or less can youraise your hand for two years or lessokay yeah we got a good a number ofpeople here that's awesomelike I was I was very fortunate to beexposed to software development likewhen I was like that's now I'm definitely my wholecareer and my whole life has beenchanged because of that fact right butit's great that those of you who arejust starting are here and you're herewanting to learn because early onconferences like these were few and farbetween but most new developers theyhave you know what's called impostorsyndrome where they feel like they don'tbelong because now the bar for what'sminimally valuable to be a realdeveloper is higher and higher andhigher you have to know all thesedifferent tools in order to to buildwebsites and it's easy for folks justgetting started to not feel like theybelong and then you can come to aconference like this and hear about evenmore things that you don't know and yourimpostor syndrome can actually get evenworse right and and then you have peoplewho've been in the industry for a whilenow who have successfully made itthrough the gate right they made itthrough the gate they know how to dosoftware development and now they'rethey're blocking the gate beinggatekeepers preventing other people fromgoing in unless they learn the way thatthey learn right they have to go throughthe hardships that they went throughthey have to know how the old codeworked before the new code works rightand you know what I just don't believethat that's the way that it should beright we should I want to encourage youthose who are just getting startedthat don't stress about it right justlearn what you want to learnenjoy it like you're not less thanyou're not subpar there are manydifferent ways to learn you can start bybuilding an app and then learn how thedetails work like I know many people whocome from boot camps who've only gotlearnedtaken schooling for three months or sixmonths we're able to do amazing amazingwork more than peoplewhohad a traditional degree okay so even ifyou just graduated yesterday right youcan be an integral part of thiscommunity I want to encourage you thatlike you can be as integral as somebodywho's been doing it for twenty yearsplus so to sum it up you've got thisokayso that's it just wanted to wrap it up Iwanted to thank the organizers of CSScoffee you for inviting me to come andspeak and putting on such like awelcoming and inclusive conference likethere's closed captioning here for thosefolks who need it there's childcare forfolks who need it like it's amazing so Iwant to take time for all of usto thank them for putting on theconference we give them a round ofapplause thank you so much thank youthank you and thank you all everyone aswell I hope you enjoy kind of the rideon this wayback machinehopefully it gives all of us anappreciation for how far we've come howbad it was I guess in the beginning andthe next time you want to complain aboutnot having something in our browser justimagine having to write framesets allthe time and then it'll make you feel alot better okay so if you have anyquestions for me just feel free to reachme out on Twitter at Ben nvp and I'mhappy to chat with you thank you verymuch[Applause][Music]
