Description: 
	The debate surrounding functional CSS has some ready to dive in and others adamant that it introduces new and undesirable patterns into our code bases. In this talk weâ€™ll take a deep dive into the world of functional CSS and compare it to other OOCSS methodologies. Weâ€™ll explore the history of functional CSS and where it came from, and debunk or support the various critiques of this approach. Weâ€™ll refactor an application from a more classic CSS model to one that leverages the library tachyons.io and do some rapid prototyping in the browser with it.
