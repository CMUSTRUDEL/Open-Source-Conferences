Description: 
	A Journey Through The History Of CSS, Mathematics, And CS To Find Out!

In my quest to find out why we call tags “tags” I learned about mathematician Emil Post (1897-1954), complexity theory, the children’s game of “tag”, the DOM as a tree & why we call them CSS “rules” (it has to do with cellular automata!) In this talk we’ll walk through the many rabbit holes I went down trying to answer this question & learn just how tied the modern browser is to fundamental computer science.

	[Music]I'm excited to be back it's my secondyear at CSS calm and welcome to my talkwhy do we call HTML tags tags I'm AndresCuervo and before we get started I wantto tell you a little bit about a littlebit about myself I'm an XOR artist asoftware engineer and an HCI researcherso that means that I spend most of mytime building web-based VR and ARexperiences demos artworks stuff likethat but I also really like nerding outabout the history of HTML and CSS and sothat's what this talk is gonna be aboutso before we answer the question that'sthe name of this talk even though I'msure this audience being says CSS compis already familiar it's always good tobe really explicit so we'll talk abouttalk a little bit about what tags withthe dad the tags that we're talkingabout are so if we view the source ofany web page you'll see a giant HTMLdocument and it'll have two two types ofthings the first will be the doctype andthat tells you what version of HTMLyou're looking at and the rest of thedocument will be composed of tags so ifwe take for example the title thecontent of the content of the tag isexample domain and that's what appearsin your browser tab in your browser tabis the name but the tags themselves arepieces of XML that are surrounded by bygreater than and less than symbols andyeah so this is what I mean when I'mreferring to a tag and everyone whoworks on the web has to know this andworks it works with this very intimatelyanda few months back I was thinking aboutwhy we call these things tags thoughonly two sort of example or only twolike definitions for the word tag that Ican think of outside of this are thetags like the things that come on yourclothing and tags are tagged like thechildren's game where kids run aroundand tap each other and neither of thoseseem like obviously related to whatwe're talking about hereand after some googling I couldn'treally find a simple answer and that'swhat led to the development of this talkso in order to answer where that wordwhere this word comes from we have totake a short trip through the history ofHTML and the so the first document toactually standardize HTML was publishedby Tim berners-lee in November of and it was called hypertext markuplanguage itself had already been around sincearound particular line that's prettyinteresting to us which is HTMLdocuments our sgml documents withgeneric semantics that are appropriatefor representing information from a widerange of domains and that's just along-winded way of saying that hTML isgood at representing a bunch ofdifferent information types so at thistime there were only even with that limited set people wereable to express a bunch of differentdocument types and that would only growwith the later introduction of more tagsand CSS but for our purposes this isinteresting because it mentions thathTML started off as an sgml document andso that needs to the limit that the nextnatural question which is what is sgmlso it stands for standard generalizedmarkup language and it preceded HTMLbeing standardized in contains it's it's actually not a markuplanguage itself but rather it's a metaMarkham it's it's it's meant to definethe medicine tax for markup languagesthat hope to be general themselves andso it contains to in in that mission tostay really broad it only contains twotypes of things the first are calledtype valid in the document and these arethings that with that this is a tag atthe top of the document that tells youwhat type of document you're looking atand this sounds really familiar becauseit's the doctype that we saw at thebeginning in our example HTML file andthen everything else in sgml is known astag valid where all of the content inthe document is surrounded by an XML tagand those are the two sorts of thingsand this sounds really familiar becausethis is what the first version of HTMLwas SPECT against but this doesn'treally answer our question because thereis something that even precedes sgmlwhich is GML and both of them werecreated by this person Charles Goldfarbat IBM and he talks as early he talksabout talking about tags as early asfragment where he talks about quoteusing an unfilled in outline of tags asa prompter from which to create a newdocument and so this is where we sort offirst see the word tag resemble resemblea thing that we would look we would lookat in HTML and recognize which is as acontainer for data and if we were tostop here this is what the chain wouldlook like and that's pretty short but wecan we can go further down the rabbithole and ask where did the tag the ridof the usage of tag in and this was easy when we were asking itabout HTML because there's a documentthat tells us it's it's an sgml thingbut so far as I could find there was nothere was really no reference to wherethe word tag came from inin the original versions of GML and XMLwhich were developed alongside eachother and so in order to get at thisquestion I took I borrowed a page fromthe field called etymology so let's talkabout that for a secondetymology is defined as the study of theorigin of words and the way in whichtheir meanings have changed theirhistory and so typically etymology isused to study words through hundreds ofyears or thousands of years of changeand so if we take the word cascade as incascading stylesheets then we can seethat it comes to English from this longseries of French Italian and Latin forto fall and that makes sense because thedefinitions are pretty related and thatit's actually pretty old word in Englishcoming in sometime in the mid s'en inmid much more involved process we can take acue from what etymologists and linguistsdo here by trying to find the earliestinstance of the word tag in computingand so in in trying to research thisquestion the earliest instance that Ican find it was credited to this personemile leon post and post was a computerscientist a or he was a mathematicianbut he made sort of fundamental inroadsin theoretical computer science he was acontemporary of Alan Turing's and he wasa logician and a mathematician so heintroduced this idea of a tag system ina paper in of the general combinatorial decisionproblem and while we won't go throughthe whole paper it's useful tounderstand what it's doing in order tounderstand why why the why the word tagis appropriate here so the paper itselfis describing a computational model forproducing words arbitrary words fromproduction rules and that sounds reallyabstract and hand-wavy so here is a veryvery minified exampleif we have a if we have a very simplealphabet that only has four letters init ABC and H and we we say that wheneverwe see an A we add on this string si sibah and whenever we see a B we add onCCA and so on with Si and si si then wecan take any initial word and starttransforming it so if we start with baathen we take a look at that first letterand we see that B goes to C CA and so wetack that on and then there is a formulafor every time we pick a production rulewe truncate the front of the string withsome amount of letters or by some amountof letters and that changes throughoutthe string but the one fundamental thingis that you keep tacking on the end ofto the end of the string that precededit until you finally hit a letter thatyou can no longer produce a productionrule for or you reach a chain that youthat is so small but you can't deleteanything from it and so yeah if we lookat this sequence not only does this looklike a little stack but it looks likethe ends of each each successive wordare sort of chasing each other and infact there is a footnote from thatoriginal paper footnote curious where post-credits this personBP gill with with noting that the thatthe axioms look like they're chasingeach other and so he gave he suggestedthe name tag and so in fact in thisusage we post would have called this atag operation and while this usage isslightly different it's it's probablyfair to say that one Emil posts work wasreally well received during his time andtoo it was it would go on to influencelanguage designers in the next in thepreceding decades and so yeah there'sthere's sort of two possibilities one isthat the word tag comes from the commonthe common word for like a tattoo tag apiece of clothing but this introducedfind like finding this evidence seems topoint to the children's game of taginfluencing BP guilt and so this is thefinal chain of etymology that I came upwith for where we get the word tag inHTML and the word for the children'sgame actually comes as far back as theto post to use the word tag for hisseminal paper and that I'm speculatingsort of made its way into the lexicon ofcomputer scientists where someone at IBMwould later create GML and sgml and thatwould go on to influence the very firstspecs of HTML and so yeah this is I Ihope that this talk sort of does twothings for youone that interests you in item ology alittle bit because I think it's reallycool and that too I hope that it sort ofencourages you to take a look at the atthe history of things that you mighthave overlooked or seen as mundanebecause if you whether it's in yourworker in your personal life there areprobably a million things around youthat you don't realize have probablysurprising and pretty interestinghistories yeah and that's all I have[Applause]you[Applause][Music]
