Playlist: CSSconf EU 2019
Description: 
	We have had Grid Layout in browsers for two years. Long enough for us to start to find the edges, and discover things we really wish it could do. The biggest missing feature from Level 1 was subgrid, which has become the main feature for Level 2 of the specification. In this talk I’ll introduce subgrid, with use cases, example code and some thoughts on where we might see Grid going in the future.
