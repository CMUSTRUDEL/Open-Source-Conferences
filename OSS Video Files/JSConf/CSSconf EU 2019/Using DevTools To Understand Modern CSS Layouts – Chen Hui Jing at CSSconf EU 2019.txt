Publication date: 2019-05-31
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2019
Description: 
	Flexbox, Grid and Box Alignment are the cornerstones of modern CSS layouts. They introduce behaviours that might seem confusing if you don’t completely understand how the browser inteprets the CSS values you assign, e.g. sizing with Flexbox, or the various options for sizing tracks in Grid. This talk will explain a variety of modern CSS layout techniques through live demonstrations via DevTools, and provide real-world use cases of how such techniques allow designs to better adapt across a broad range of viewports.
