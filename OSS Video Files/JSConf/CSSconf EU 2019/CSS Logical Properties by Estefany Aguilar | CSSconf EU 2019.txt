Description: 
	For many of us, when navigating the web, we only ever encounter elements of the web to be left-aligned. But actually, they are start-aligned! In right-to-left languages like Hebrew, Arabic or Persian, the same settings are right-aligned. That is the beauty of the web: It allows us to deliver our content to both writing directions. That is why structuring our CSS layouts in a logical way rather than with physical direction way can help us to write code that works across languages. This talk will explain how CSS logical properties make that even easier.

	[Music]hi hello everybody my name is StefanAguilar I'm fronting developer anillustratorI'm from made in Colombia and this is myfirst time in Berlin I love training andlearning new information abouttechnology and the Colombian techcommunities have been a source ofinspiration for mein Colombia we have about communities providing spaces forinnovation and collaborative learningimagine I'm one of three leaders ofmaize in CSS community the first andonly CSS community in my country acommunity with more than community that creates positive changeand educates for the future today I'mgoing to talk about CSS logicalproperties in CSS we have a lot ofkeywords to describe physical positionssuch as left right top and bottom let'stake this image for example if we wantto move an element of the screen we willuse a container with a relative positionthe element with absolute position topcourse moving an element is not the onlything that we want to do we also need towork with other physical properties suchas margin top bar the bottom paddingleft these properties come naturally ifwe are working in an English gradingsystem for us they are written in a webpage is top left because we graph fromleft to right but have you ever thoughthow our layout will look in a differentrating system in a different alphabetfor example in Arabic Hebrew and Persianvague right from right to left and theorigin of the screen is top right sowhat you will see on the left side onthe English reading mode you will see onthe right side in anHebrew impatient grading systemsconsequently working with physicalproperties can become a problem if wewant our layout to work in manylanguages I just mentioned the wordsgrading modes but I want us to look athow these specification works and whatwe can gain from itthese riding modes can help us betterunderstand CSS green flexbox and thework involved in creating a web page ina new language the gradient mode affectboth the organization and electionallottee in our web page so the gradingnote is the first building block of itsdesign that we create CSS is able tosupport many different internationalgrading systems systems that rise fromleft to right such as the latins this isthe most commonly used writing systemsaround the world with more than twothousands derived from left to right such as theArabic grading systems this is thesecond most commonly used writingsystems around the world it is used inmany languages around the Middle EastAsia and Africa systems that arebi-directional these are a combinationof Latins and Arabic alphabets systemsthat are verticals such as Asiancharacters because CSS support all thesemany languages there are five possiblecareer mode options horizonte tbéamévertical l are vertical RL sideways l rand sideways r l agrarian mode in CSS isdetermined by the properties of readingmode direction and text orientation itis mainly defined in terms of block flowdirection and in line based direction solet's look Iranian CSS words if you havework with CSS before you might befamiliar with display:block anddisplayingif we are in a default grading mode wewill see that by using display:block allthe elements are placed very curly fromthe top of the page to the bottombut if we use display:inline we will seethat the elements are placedside-by-side from left to right this isthe align base duration within the casehow we read read and write but block andalign concepts will help us understandCSS logical properties ahead let's takea look at some examples for differentvalues rally mode horizontal tbhhorizontal T beam is the initial valuethe text is displayed from left to rightwe have locked row direction from top tobottomboth the grading mode and the typographymode are horizontal reading modeBerrocal are L the text is displayedfrom top to bottom with a block flowdirection from right to leftboth the grading mode and thetypographies mode are very cool readingmode very kal-el are the text isdisplayed from top to bottom with ablock flow direction from left to rightboth the grading mode and the typographymode are vertical running mode sidewaysL ll the text is displayed from top tobottom with a block flow direction fromright to left the grading mode isverticalbut the typography mode and the symbolsare placed on the right side runningmode sideways L are the text isdisplayed from bottom to top with ablock flow direction from left to rightthe growing mode is vertical but atypography mode and symbols are placedon the left side is important toconsider the compatibility betweenrunning mode and browsers in this tablefrom Cana use we can see which browsersare compactmalinka remote property everything shownin green is the support of Belgium butin some versions of Chrome Safari andopera the color red indicates it is notsuper yet another consideration is thatsome versions in a peck fix like WebKitor MS to be able to use running modeproperly and you can look up here indisappearing huh where it says lowell inMayanother important property of ReadingMode is direction the election propertydefines how inline content such as thecharacters in a paragraph the paragraphflow on the screenit can have two values left to right isthe first one and the other one is rightto leftCSS logical properties automatically maplayouts to a constant Direction cellwith the direction and the gray verymode a properties before we use physicalposition to be layout but more recentlywe have started using a new approach tobuilding layout flexboxand CSS grid let's take a deeper lookinto flexbox and the logic involvedflexbox doesn't take into accountphysical dimensions such as left righttop and bottom it uses values like flexestar and flex and these values rely onthe direction of the main and cross axiswhich we using flexbox this is betterbecause concept like start and L are upin are relative in Flex box and can beeasily flippedhere we have an example of flex box inaction the first thing that you need todo to create this example is define thecontainer we display flex by default allthe elements are placed side by sidefrom left to rightif we need the elements to be placedvery column we need to add anotherproperty to the container flex directionwe need to keep in mind that flex box isa single direction layout concept thatis the elements can be placed inoriental rose or vertical columns forthis reason flex Direction has fourdifferent values row row is the defaultvalue and depends of the direction ofthe under reading mode property if youare in an LTR direction you can see thatthe elements are placed side by sidefrom left right but if you are in an LTIdirection you can see the elements areplaced from right to left row rivers isthe same concept like rows but in thiscase if you are in an LTR direction youcan see the elements are placed side byside from right to left and if you arein an RTL direction you can see theelements are placed side by side fromleft to right column is the same conceptlike row but in this case the elementsare placed top to bottom and culinarywealth is the same that row reverse butin this case the elements are placed tobottom to top with only these twoproperties display flex and flexdirection we can see the magic in thisexample and when the bottoms change tothe values of the growing mode propertyin horizontal tea be very kal-el are andvertical are in flexbox the behavior oftheir lives depend of the flex directionproperty for example justified contentalong the elements horizontally if flexdirection is row or Rory where's markvertically if the flow direction iscolumn or curlcolumnreverse this is the real beauty offlexbox and this is the beginning of thelogic concepts in our layout Joseph Icontent property can be take five valuesflex start flex and center is spacebetween and space around but let's focuson the first two flex start and flicksit in this expect in this example youcan see that the start and end conceptschange dependent of the gradient modeproblem after flexbox the most powerfullayout systems appear CSS grid CSS gridis a two dimensional system createdspecifically to solve the layoutsproblem we have been hacking from a longtime CSS grid doesn't know left righttop and bottom properties basically CSSgrid flows the same logic ax place booksyou can define the position of the greenitems with properties such as green rowsare or green called column end similarlyto flexbox CSS grid also has logicalproperties instead of physical pointslet's take a look at one example to getstarted you have defined the containerwe display grid the elements we also forcoordinate the elements you need thecontainer define with rip templatecolumns or greet and paid rows to placethe children into the grid we need todefine each elements with green columnstart one green column and two green rowstart one and grid row and two or use ashorthand like write Rho star / M realrow start end the way of thinking in CSSlogical properties a very importantthing in CSS is the box modelwe use we are used the box model shownon the left side on the screen this isnot wrong this is still correct but inbut in order to use the CSS logicalpropertywe must stop thinking in in terms ofleft right top and bottom and replacethem with inline star in line and blockstart and block end you can see thischange in language shown in the secondbox model now we return to this sourceproperty these two concepts blood andstar and in life when we are work withlogical properties we start understandthe block and align axis as we ship tothis way of thinking of our layoutbegins to make more sense nowour logical properties will be like thelist shown on the left margins on theleft of this table you can see the nameof the property of the physical propertymargin top margin left margin rightmargin bottom and in the right side youcan see the equivalent of these aphysical property for example of margintop the equivalent is margin block starin a logical problem at the same inmargin right the equivalent is margin inline end this is an example of marginsin this case I use margin block starproperty and we can see how it changedwhen running mode property change youwill want to keep your eyes on it on thespace between the first block and thesecond block this is the margin blockpalette this is the same of margins onthe left side you can see the propertiesthe physical properties such as paddingtop padding left padding right and parambottom and the right side you can seethe logical propertythe Kimmel analogical property so shehas padding block star black Palininline star Palin in line and I'mPauline block and here there are someexamples for palates again you can seehow Palin's change when they grow inmode change the container here isshowing their purple and the shy isrepresenting with them with the borderin color white there are purpleoutside of the white dots is the partyborders in this table you can see alittle of the left side the physicalproperties this is a little bit complexbecause is the border top and you canplace the size or style or color and thesame the logical problem the logicalequivalent property is bordered blockstar and you can set them size style orcolor this example of borders might be alittle more complicated the differentcolors of the border shown here willhelp you track how they they changedifferently with the red border I usethe border in line start preparing forthe purple border I use the borderinline star properly and affect theother block with yellow border I use theborder block eight positions on the leftyou see the name of the property as useof the old box model top left right andbottom and the left side you can see thelogical problem equivalent like insteadblock start instead in line startinstead in line and are in safe blockand just like running mode thecompatibility is importantand again some Belgians need a prix fixeand you can lick you can see and thisupper right hand when say global is to dot think in ways of create webpage thataccessible to everyone thinking in termsor logical properties is a good practicewhen creating a webpage with multiplelanguages but ok I have a little quizfor you please take out your phone andwrite Kahoot that I teamOhokay in your phone you can see effectsgame thing here you put the eye the codeyes okay[Music]hops everybody join the game okay okaysee you logical properties the firstquestion which is the first buildingblock of this design delivery[Music][Applause]the next okay which concepts help usunderstand the CSS elements where is thelogical property equivalent to themargin top physical profit[Music][Music]whoa what is the logical propertyequivalent to the party left I don'tknow what is the name of a case the lastquestion thinking in terms of logicalpropertiesYakub practice when creating a webpage[Music]okay the winners please find me todayfinally during the coffee break please Ihave a little gay for youColumbian candies and okayeverybody I have a Snickers for youdon't worryma I have a groomrape onions we have a new member of theCSS come family CSS come Columbia andone of the leaders of the CSS confColumbia I'm very very excited to hostthis conference in managing the nextyear um thank you find me on socialmedia at DEFCON[Music]
