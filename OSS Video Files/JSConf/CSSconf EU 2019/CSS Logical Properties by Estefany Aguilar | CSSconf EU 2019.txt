Description: 
	For many of us, when navigating the web, we only ever encounter elements of the web to be left-aligned. But actually, they are start-aligned! In right-to-left languages like Hebrew, Arabic or Persian, the same settings are right-aligned. That is the beauty of the web: It allows us to deliver our content to both writing directions.

This talk will explain how CSS logical properties make that even easier.
