conference and all thevolunteers that have made us happen overthe last few months[Applause]so this is now the sixth year of CSScan't be you this photo is from September EU it was much smaller in terms of venueand numbers of people that it was thesame in essence bringing people with aninterest exterior city about CSStogether in one space exchanging ideaslearning something new how did it allbegin just a few months prior thefirst-ever CSS comp based in the USNicole Sullivan was an organizer withthe aim to address the gap in conferencespace there are already conferences topick they're already the focus onJavaScript or design and they were greatbut they didn't have CSS developers theydidn't have those topics talked about itwas something missing from their CSScomp us is born and one of the attendeesof this eventChrissa came to Berlin and a plan tobring that conference to Europe and justa few months later he was herehello can hear me yes thank you[Applause]great so so back in conference and and now six years latersix events later I should say we're herewhat have we achieved throughout theyears they've been so many fascinatingtalks the topics talked about and shareto a wider audience from newspecifications such as CSS grid andvariable fonts to CSS animation to newdeveloper tools and techniques forwriting CSS such as CSS and jeaiousthere's a wealth of content that'savailable in the back catalogue ofconferences and videos online thesevideos are now available for developersand would-be developers to watch learnfrom and be inspired one of my favoriteaspects of this conference is thescholarship program for people whootherwise wouldn't be able to attendover the years and amazing have received scholarships to attendthis conference for many recipients ofthat scholarship is the first timethey've been able to take part in thebroader developer community inspired bythis main conference CSS classes hasbeen offered in multiple cities BerlinHamburg Prague and suit to be anAmsterdam a way to introduce people toprogramming via CSS whether you're abeginner or have been programming foryears the ethos of CSS comp remains thesame to welcome people into web but it'sbecome a global movement CSS comp usAustralia Norway and Argentina Asia andsivan some upcoming ones in beautiful inColombia from the startCSS con tu has had a open call forproposals this means that anyone nomatter their background or relativeexperience could have a shot of being onstage two years ago I gave my very firstconference talk on the stageat that point I'd only been a developerfor about a year and half I didn't knowmuch about confident speaking or how towrite an abstract for a tech event andwhen it came to deciding on a talk andhelping refine an abstract polishing thetalk every stage is able to get supportand encouragement from different membersof this community how did I meet thosepeopleit was during breaks during the eventsconferences meetups asking questions onTwitter sharing my interest to learnasking for advice so keep in touch withthe people here not here today for thefirst time if you heard a greatcommunity lightning talk drop them amessage afterwards if there's a speakerwho's inspired you to try out somethingnew share that with them and more widelythe connections you've made therelationships you've built today will beinvaluable it can be incredibly helpfulto hear about people's experiences Ihave a challenge for you what do youhave to offer if you're a web developermaybe it's a half hour chat talkingabout what your job is like that couldhelp a person considering a change intheir career have a really clear idea ofwhat opportunities are available to themand how they can achieve their goals ifyou're a native English speaker maybeoffer to edit a talk to abstract theseminars if you're brand new to using atool or a library sharing yourexperience about how it was just to usethat can be great for the main Tanners afresh perspectiveRachel Andrew mentioned this morninghave feedback from you to the CSSworking group of hours vendors can bereally work useful but the developmentof tech if you find it stressful talkingto people at events that's fine as wellyou can share your advice in blog postsmaybe or maybe briefly on a creditTwitter dick Q&A you have your uniqueperspectiveand being able to share that with othersis a wonder often who we talk aboutcommunity of web developers designersand more but what does the CSS communitymean here it could just mean having acommon interest but is it superficiallyjust that we write CSS what could it bemore than that what creates that slatesense of belonging having a supportiveplace my view that it's something we allhave a part in whether we've been on webdevelopment for decades or whether we'rejust starting to explore it right nowmany technical fields have their areasof tension and CSS isn't an exception Iwant to examine some things that I'venoticed that aren't liking so well somethings that can be jarring some thingsthat we can reflect on over the pastcouple of years has been a swell ofargue pitting two approaches against oneanother your ask the picker site are youwith us or against us it's pretty muchas though you're going into battle rightas though if you should be part of aclique a group have a part of youridentity supporting one particular wayof thinking on one hand they're stuck inthe past using CSS and J's is the futurehow can they not see how it solves somany issues on the other all they can'tbe bothered to learn how to use theCascade if they're not worth our timewhat would it look like if we examinethe emotional way we give thesetechnical implications implementationsand that we chose to act differentlywe've been having this argument foryears and it's led to hostility anddivision it's time to move on and findour path forwards all tools have theirpros and cons we should be able tolisten to each other respect one anotherand move on from thereanother long-standing issue that likesto focus on is this there's thisperceived hierarchy where in theindustry knowledge of CSS isn't oftenconsidered as important as JavaScript inthe same way that front-end is often notconsidered as important as back and worksuch as note as Ivana McConnell said onthe stage two years ago there's ahierarchy problem this constructedhierarchy means people who are C'speople who see a specialist often playedless than JavaScript specialists careerprogression within organizations areoften stunted a JavaScript specialistcan gain a seniority quite quickly or asthe CSS specialist often needs to goabove and beyond to prove the expertiseis just as valuable what can we do tochange thisit'll take a concerted effort on behalfof us all the language you use whentalking about expertise in spaces likethis online in meetups in offices it'simportant to pay attention to this notewhat assumptions you're making will allwork assumptions you're hearing othersmake and then act on changing that it'sonly by respecting others expertise isvalid can we get rid of these falsehierarchies of importancewe have in the space missing talks overthe community lounge as well as talks onstage when we leave here it's not justwith a pocket full of stickers andbadges as nice as wellit's experiences that we take away andthat inform us how we can step forwardsinclusion is going out of your way tomake a space welcoming to otherindividuals it's listening to them aboutwhat they need and acting on it in thisindustry we talk about inclusive designensuring our websites we build areaccessible and don't form barriers topeople well about our own tech spacesphysical spaces like this conference wehave live captions to enable those withhearing and parents to be able toparticipate in real time at theconference we have a scholarship schemethat enables this space to be attendedby those who otherwise can afford itthe inclusion doesn't just stop at thesedoors it's about how we write our opensource libraries to welcome people whodon't have English as a native languageit's about how we enforce codes ofconduct online to ensure there's a clearunderstanding of expected behavior it'sabout ensuring those from marginalizedgroups aren't excludedit's about respecting others often thoseof us in the US or Europe Centerourselves intact this means of an urbanso focused here every year peopleexpected a speakers to conferences inEurope and the u.s. denied visas tospeak due to political circumstances weshould be using the privilege that wehave to elevate others it's about beingcurious fishing boundaries learning whythings are the way they are proposingnew ways of thinking communicating witheach other across the traditionalboundaries of dev designer browserengineer spec proposer expertise isn'tsomething that necessary takes years toachieve sometimes it can be the newjoiner to the fields who gives the mostinsightful critique and pushes theboundaries of what is the receivedwisdom this is about inspiring a newgeneration of web developers andrevitalizing the space for those alreadyin the industrybuilding community it starts with ashared interest in our topic in our caseCSS but it grows to be so much more thanthatit's bringing people together whether inphysical spaces like this one or indigital spaces onlineit requires ensuring that there's mutualrespect inclusivity and a platform forsharing expertise there are many ways todo this take inspiration from thisconference and others talk to peopleabout what they needthere isn't being served by currentevents and online spaces what is left isfor you to come together to build yourcommunitythank you CSS comfy[Applause][Music]
