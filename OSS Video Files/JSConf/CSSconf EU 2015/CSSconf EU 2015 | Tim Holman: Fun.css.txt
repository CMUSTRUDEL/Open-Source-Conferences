Title: CSSconf EU 2015 | Tim Holman: Fun.css
Publication date: 2015-09-26
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2015
Description: 
	On a mission to take that seriousness away from the world of web development Timâ€™s talk, Fun.css, delves into some of the strangest areas of the internet. Tim introduces us to unusual and bizarre techniques and ways of thinking that we can use to create friendlier and, at the very least, more interesting experiences.

Tim is an Australian developer who has both a love and a flair for all things quirky and strange online. When he's not working on Tumblr, you'll find him building something bizarre which, in his own words, the world definitely does not need.

all right hi how is everybody

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm Tim actually I'll fix this for you

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:31,990
I'm from Australia so that was pretty

00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,250
that was a pretty cool new joke I'm

00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,050
allowed to do that because I'm actually

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,150
from Australia so that's alright

00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,860
CSS cough god it's been such a big day

00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,380
today it's been such a good day I feel I

00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,910
feel so privileged to be amongst like

00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,280
the speakers that we've had

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,590
it's truly special and everyone has been

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,590
like so insanely helpful I had this

00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,510
weird moment earlier today where my I

00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,910
didn't bring like a German convert a

00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,129
plug and my laptop was getting getting

00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,739
low and Mac started doing like power

00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:01,570
saving things and eventually just

00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:02,620
stopped responding and I had to like do

00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,360
that thing where you hold the power

00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,530
button down and I felt really weird I

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,380
was like I was smothering it with a

00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,010
pillow it's like Shh it's gonna be all

00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,080
over soon that was I was a bit strange

00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,510
so it was like yeah there's been such a

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,689
huge variety of talks today this is this

00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,040
is a little bit of a different talk

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,659
because you're definitely not going to

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,939
learn anything if anything it's kind of

00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:26,860
like an unlearning unlearning kind of

00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:28,450
talk I've definitely seen the sketch

00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,280
notes from my talks before and it's just

00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,799
basically an empty page with my name

00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,439
written in the centre so take your

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,970
thinking caps off we're gonna go on a

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,700
great great adventure I want to talk

00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,140
about fun I want to talk about having

00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,340
fun with the code and having fun with

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,890
the tools that we have because we have

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,200
so much power and we have so much

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,180
ability to create such crazy cool things

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,479
you know I'm happy to like talk about

00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,890
CSS all day and I can talk about kind of

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,570
like the frameworks and stuff but in a

00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,490
weird way I kind of feel like I'm

00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,689
talking about building a kite and I'm

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,070
not actually talking about flying the

00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:01,960
kite and flying the kite is the best

00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,549
thing so that's that's kind of what this

00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,590
talk is about this is my qualification

00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:08,410
CSS for babies that's where I learned

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,880
everything so the first thing that I

00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,370
want to talk about is this is this kind

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,840
of framework I you've kind of seen these

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,890
like star wipes going on actually

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,460
everything in this whole talk is

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,170
epileptic I'm sorry I really like I just

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,150
put oh there he goes well there we go

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,610
here's the CSS for that it's using mask

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,840
image with an SVG which is fantastic it

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,650
kind of gives you some cool things like

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,360
I can change it to hearts I can do a hot

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,860
which was really nice like a thumbs up

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,290
maybe some subliminal messaging there

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,480
like Tim's a cool guy Tim's a cool guy

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,579
Tim's a cool guy Tim's a cool guy

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:45,049
I put I put him a stash in that for Nick

00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:46,609
actually which was nice yeah I also I

00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:48,019
also put a donkey in that which is

00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:50,060
technically an

00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:54,290
so I was pretty proud of myself there

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:56,930
they hit my new in maturity levels but

00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,359
let's stick with the star I found this

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:02,780
great video it was actually a tribute to

00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:03,889
star wipes in a star wipe format which

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,019
was which was kind of like the

00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:07,609
inspiration to want to make a

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,349
presentation framework because there's

00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:10,819
so many this reveal Jay asked is like I

00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:12,439
know there's a thousand systems to do

00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:13,939
these things but none of them offered

00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,549
star wipes which which was a little bit

00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:17,959
distressing anyway this is kind of what

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:20,299
I'm talking about when I say fun like I

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,159
I really like to run into something and

00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:23,780
kind of hit it head-on really football

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,310
and then kind of start exploring and

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,389
start going like a little bit deeper and

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,359
a little bit deeper and a little bit

00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:30,859
deeper to see kind of where it can go

00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:34,819
and what what we can kind of do with

00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:36,760
with what we're creating in school

00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:39,500
school in Australia was pretty laid-back

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,889
I was kind of like a little bit of a

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,870
lazy kid and I know CSS is is something

00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,090
that you can kind of use lazily and you

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:50,150
can use aggressively and powerfully and

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,099
I sometimes I find myself leaning kind

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,799
of on the lazy side but it was also a

00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:57,440
great way to kind of describe things so

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,819
here's me this is a weird format that's

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,400
the number I decided I was probably

00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,620
about this 63rd thousandth Tim Holman in

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,090
the world which is you know it's just

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,699
nice I'm about seven thousand pixels

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,790
tall probably um

00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:12,919
yeah mm wide I've got some padding now

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,599
that it's summer well summers ending but

00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,099
hopefully I can get rid of that padding

00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,539
this is kind of what I did with my

00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:19,130
assignments in school you had to submit

00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:21,349
assignments like it's three pages or

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,229
four pages of five pages or ten pages it

00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:26,599
was particularly bad and you could kind

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:28,190
of cheat the system so like books I

00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:31,580
bought a box it's a piece of paper of

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,260
course first increase the padding like

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,000
then you're gonna have less words in

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,090
each line it's gonna stuck in our faster

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,969
next increase the word spacing suddenly

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,919
like one page is at least two pages now

00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:44,659
increase the letter spacing when you're

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,300
really like slip that one through the

00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:49,099
teachers it's a good way to do it and

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,189
it's the lazy way it's the lazy approach

00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:58,129
it's the Tim Holman tried and trusted

00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:59,419
method for for development so I kind of

00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:00,949
wanted to put something like that into

00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,029
this into this presentation that was

00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,580
kind of like oh you know I've got to

00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:06,830
talk for for 30 minutes or so what's

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,719
like the the padding decrease that I can

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,159
put on this so like into the framework

00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:12,740
here I kind of build a system to like

00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:16,699
slow down the transition so I can really

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:20,929
like play it slow make sure I get the

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:22,189
time that I'm kind of going for yeah you

00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:23,539
know and that I can speed it up again it

00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,499
can be like fostering the furious oh

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:27,459
that's not fast enough

00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:30,559
Vin Diesel that's me what I'm developing

00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:32,360
I liked I actually really like these CSS

00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:33,830
puns in this I guess there's a ton of

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,419
them online there was a few like reddit

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,339
threads and this is like a nice one Lego

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,759
display:block I like it because I

00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:44,659
understand it that's the main thing

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:47,149
Titanic float:none yeah so it's not in

00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:49,309
bad taste so well no they didn't even

00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:51,259
know about CSS back then periodic

00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:53,479
display table that's a good one

00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,680
muffins ready over for wide visible if I

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,979
made them you'll never get to that

00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,819
status Chuck Norris's color is badass

00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:03,469
naturally this is really cool I'm from

00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,329
Australia that's the that's the rotation

00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:07,180
that I have naturally in my eyes

00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:09,319
everyone sitting on the roof right now

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,269
this was kind of me when I found these

00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,769
these plums I was like I'm gonna be

00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:15,979
great at this I'm like I can be a funny

00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:17,179
guy I can make some weird jokes and all

00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:18,110
of them turned out to be really

00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:20,800
depressing actually

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:26,059
so like here's me here are my abs

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,939
display:none here's me here's my beard

00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:31,339
now I've got like a patchy SVG mask over

00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:34,099
it for the rest of my life this is my

00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:35,269
regular transition speed like that's

00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:37,159
pretty accurate

00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,539
when seamless arrives at the door BAM

00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,219
I'm fast as anything do you have

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:43,429
seamless here for me no like Chinese

00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:45,889
delivery what I'm preparing for this

00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:47,209
slow is anything I kind of like really

00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:50,360
got bogged down I kind of got bogged

00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:51,919
down building the system this is me when

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,879
I'm making something and I stop to think

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,870
of ideas do you ever get that feeling

00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,390
when you're when you're

00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,890
well doing something and your your head

00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,240
is just going off it's like if I wasn't

00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,680
developing this these are the other

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,270
things that I would be developing that's

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,500
like me all the time I'm just like I'm

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,700
building this but we're gonna be cool if

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,470
I wasn't doing this and I could do

00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,340
something else and I just want to start

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,020
something start something start

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,610
something something start something so

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,650
when I made this I started to make this

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,030
presentation to talk about a fun with

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,770
CSS and I spent most of the time

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,350
building the framework which is which is

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,610
now what I'm talking about I kind of

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,750
have like this nervousness when I'm

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,060
developing I don't know where I came

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,890
from to be honest probably like

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,540
untrustworthy Australian Internet where

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,950
I just like saved everything I'm just

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,020
like safe safe safe safe safe safe safe

00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,000
three times I press the Save button at

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,190
least three times on every file that I

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,490
want to save I built this into here so

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,880
like every slide I can kind of save my

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,760
there we go

00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,890
I can save me I save my status save

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,300
where I'm at keep going it's a nice you

00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,030
know it's a nice little fullback here's

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,380
me clapping applauding myself like clean

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,330
girl free so this was like my list of

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,040
fears when when I was giving a

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,410
conference talk like everybody kind of

00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,550
has like a few little fears obviously

00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,700
the first one was that I wasn't feeling

00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,320
the time which which I can defeat by

00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,850
slowing the transition slowing the

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,560
slides down a lot I might do it you know

00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,460
I've got a clock here if I'm if I'm not

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,690
feeling in time

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,370
that's definitely what's gonna happen

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,900
everything's gonna break down you know I

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,490
can't really do that much about that but

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,380
I can definitely like save my position

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,330
on every single slide every single time

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,090
and the next one was like that I'm gonna

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,350
forget what I'm gonna say which is you

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,790
know that's a huge fear right like

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,620
public speaking is a huge fear you come

00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,180
up and you're like oh what was I going

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,430
to say what was I gonna say so I needed

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:28,580
to build in speaking notes obviously to

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,530
this this presentation system so I did

00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,810
it like this you know here here up come

00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,100
my hand so you can actually will see it

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,630
you know it's kind of nice I'm like if I

00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,530
have trouble seeing things you guys can

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,970
see it as well it was it was a nice

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,520
system that was actually that was

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,630
papyrus if anyone asked I actually found

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,240
somebody the other day

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:52,630
combined comic sans and papyrus into a

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:57,020
new super font move-over Helvetica

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:58,730
papyrus sans is here it was fantastic

00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,400
this was the CSS that I used to make my

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,050
hands look less ugly in there a little

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,490
bit of blur you know Photoshop is dead

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,140
we already learned it today a little bit

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,000
of brightness a little bit of grayscale

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,280
take some color out of these

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,560
bad boys maybe I'm born with it maybe

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:19,580
it's mabeline all right

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,930
really I should just like blow them

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,370
completely and you wouldn't you wouldn't

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,810
have to deal with you wouldn't have to

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,070
deal with those hands are really weird

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,390
when you look at them up close and

00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,000
especially when you're developing

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,950
looking at hands I kind of had this

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,680
problem when I built the system to to

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,790
give me to give me notes where I was

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,160
kind of like rehearsing and practicing

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,620
the speech as a practicing the talk as

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,570
you do and I kind of found that I wasn't

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,890
actually learning it like I was you know

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,690
I was kind of falling back into those

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,310
lazy ways and I was cheating again

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,720
so like every slide I'd be like what's

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,860
that like this you know this doesn't

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,230
really make sense I'm like what was I

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,370
trying to do there and and of course I

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,950
would like get out the hands and it's

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,150
like oh why why can't I stop cheating so

00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,150
I kind of had to build it this thing

00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,620
where after i after I try to cheat for a

00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:05,390
few times it starts messing with the

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,020
text you know it gets gets worse it gets

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,690
worse

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,260
we're like checking you know that would

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,670
be bad

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,010
and then eventually it's like you're

00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:16,160
over you're done Tim you're you're in

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:18,020
big trouble I kind of like this concept

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,670
I kind of liken it to Bilbo in the ring

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,490
like he kind of relies on this thing and

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,860
it just just kind of goes a little bit

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,990
crazy in the end and the concept of like

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,060
computers getting mad at us and kind of

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,770
like intentionally building something to

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,450
to hurt people and to ruin people's

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,400
experience I kind of really like that

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,170
idea I think it's like a weird way of

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,970
thinking when you're when you're trying

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,200
to make an experience negative on you're

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,310
trying to make something a little bit

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
worse so trying to make something a

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,690
little bit weird and a little bit more

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,120
wrong because nobody really does that

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,190
that much and passwords are a big one

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,780
possible is just like well it's kind of

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,520
like a pet peeve of mine where you put

00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,500
in a password and it's like oh your

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,089
password is too it's too simple like

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,430
that's kind of an insult it's like Tim

00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:00,680
your simple person you can't you can't

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,000
remember anything else and I kind of

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,410
like feel a little bit hurt by that

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,540
every single time I get her I feel like

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,400
my password 10 years ago if I use it

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,570
again now it's like the technology's

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,130
changed we understand that right the

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,740
technology has changed you can crack

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:15,950
passwords faster so I kind of my

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,000
Possible's got weaker over time and and

00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,150
I kind of wanted to play around with

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,560
that this is a website that I built with

00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:24,100
friend is called the passive-aggressive

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,350
password machine my my my path to world

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,990
dominance of course of all's around

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,610
having my own password algorithm to

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,470
detect strengths so when you're kind of

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,120
talking that the idea was like you're

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,860
kind of being talking down to like

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,630
really you called that a password do you

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,280
even know what a password is that's what

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,630
I feel when I says my possible speak I'm

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,760
not angry I'm just disappointed

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,860
my mom's used that one on me before and

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,240
it stings the most right to your core

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,040
you never you never really forget though

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,280
and try hard I like blah blah you know

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,240
it gets I got some numbers in there in

00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,300
the end it's like you're not even gonna

00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:01,900
remember this part that's okay because

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,880
at least you're proud of me now yeah I

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,440
kind of get like a little bit yeah I

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,820
kind of get a little bit down when I see

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,290
these things and and it's kind of nice

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,730
to to kind of explore them and you know

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,780
sometimes you get a little bit sad maybe

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,310
I'm making some jokes in the

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,340
presentation and the not quite going

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,900
over as well so I kind of built in

00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,420
motivational notes so like if I press em

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:26,580
it's like Tim you can do it amazing like

00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:30,220
you're doing great thank you Oh God oh

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,570
it's so nice isn't it I feel really good

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,860
now and then I was like maybe Tim you're

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,420
gonna get you're gonna get a little bit

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,010
over you're gonna get a little bit too

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:40,870
on top so I have some demotivational

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:44,950
ones as well all right let's keep it

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:46,570
happy let's keep it happy I kind of got

00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,960
a lot I got pretty distracted building

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,030
this whole thing you know that's that's

00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,220
kind of the crux of it I built in x-ray

00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,360
mode oops so it goes all kind of x-ray

00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,040
if you try to get speaking those in

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,560
x-ray mode you get skeleton hands that's

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,740
nice that's a must in anything really

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,940
it's on x-ray off I can like I know if

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,760
you can see it here I can like beach

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:12,310
ball beach ball my mouth you know just

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,960
in case I need to have some unenforced

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,140
technical difficulties and get out of

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,140
here

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,880
it's a weird thing when you just kind of

00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,170
go down the rabbit hole and there's

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,730
nothing really stopping you you just

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,780
kind of get deeper and deeper and deeper

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,100
and deeper strange yeah so that's that's

00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,050
star wipe

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,120
the the presentation system of the

00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,260
future but I should I should move on

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,030
from there

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,260
but is this fun is this the kind of fun

00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,450
thing this is the stuff that I enjoy

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,860
making the most like I I know there's

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,300
nothing really holding you back there's

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,710
no one telling me there's no one telling

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,350
anyone here really like this is the

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,790
wrong way to to kind of enjoy yourself

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,920
and to make weird things and kind of

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:54,000
like surprise and delight everybody that

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,180
you're that you're going through I this

00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:03,480
is a good slide isn't it

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:06,390
no notes there I was a bit of a

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,810
prankster in school and and kind of as

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:11,490
as I've grown up you know the pranks

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,140
kind of evolved and they use like in

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,640
school you have like a pencil or a glue

00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,950
stick and you put on someone's chair and

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,630
it's the funniest thing

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,030
and as you know as you kind of grow into

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,370
a new set of tools your your pranks

00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,510
evolve a little bit and there's a lot of

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,090
cool stuff that you can do with CSS

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,820
that's the equivalent of chucking a

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,870
slice of cheese on someone's bass

00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,170
there's this file I don't know if

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,380
anyone's seen it custom CSS and it lives

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:41,040
in the chrome lives in like the chrome

00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:43,410
like root of your of your laptop and any

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,700
CSS that you put in this file will run

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:50,540
on every single page that person goes to

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:53,310
it's it's fantastic it's really really

00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,900
when I found this like I ran straight to

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,320
the bathroom and giggled for like five

00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,760
minutes

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,390
I hadn't even done anything I was like

00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,890
oh we are gonna have so much fun here so

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,020
he wrote like a little bash script that

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,700
that would inject whatever I wanted into

00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,470
this into this and when somebody leaves

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,360
that laptop open I would kind of go onto

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,620
that computer and you know get it out of

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,780
github and I just paste it into a

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,800
terminal close the terminal delete the

00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:18,240
history of the browser and it's

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:24,190
completely gone and this is so good so

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:26,080
custom CSS it is God's gift to man

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:31,750
so this is a good one this was the the

00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:33,160
hue rotation put it on everything forget

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,340
it throw out the rulebook there is no

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,630
rulebook you know we understand this

00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,550
thing we could probably look at it and

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,320
go oh something strange is happening

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,360
here but I don't quite tell what it is

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,910
but you know if you do that to your

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,580
sister or your workmates

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:51,640
no idea here's like I mean I include

00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,200
that little effect or if it loads this

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,090
is it you've got to do it really subtle

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,070
like you have to have like this is ten

00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,150
seconds this is too fast you don't want

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,340
to do it in ten seconds you want to do

00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,620
it over 100 seconds you want somebody on

00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,610
Google to just be like a little bit

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,610
questioning if they're going crazy

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,870
just a little bit

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,040
I mean it doesn't end there it doesn't

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,690
end there

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,090
this is a good one a lot of things use

00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,860
the class an ID logo you can rotate them

00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,540
and this is kind of a broad this is what

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,710
I call like a broad spectrum prank

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,820
really because this is good this is kind

00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,290
of it doesn't ruin your experience

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,700
you're gonna see it and you're gonna be

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,520
on google and you're gonna see the logo

00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:39,850
kind of rotating like Oh Google's doing

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,100
one of those things today yeah it must

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,520
be it must be like the invention of the

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,170
merry-go-round or something Netflix it

00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,960
does I just kind of like put this on for

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,220
a while tried it out and you kind of

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,710
forget when you've done this to somebody

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,120
because it's not that harmful but every

00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,770
now and then like I've had this like

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,090
passing like I've kind of overheard it

00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,320
in the office was like have you noticed

00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:02,260
that all the websites online are

00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,180
spinning it's been happening for the

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:07,440
past few weeks I'm like oh I left

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:11,820
it on this guy's okay I left it there

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:15,400
Google's the same logo no it's a nice

00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,449
it's a nice subtle subtle messing

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,339
sometimes you can just make everything

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,060
grayscale there's suddenly everyone

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,180
thinks that they're a little bit

00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,350
colorblind this is cruel and it's kind

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,360
of especially strange to have you open

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,589
Firefox everything's fine go back to

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,040
Chrome me like oh my chrome is just

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:31,450
screwed everything's black and white

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,070
doesn't doesn't make any sense this is

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,610
what I actually tried to do first I

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:40,270
tried to yeah took Oh Tim you've gone

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:44,260
too far you've gone too far it doesn't

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:47,520
work it doesn't work I was I was so

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,260
excited I particularly like this because

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,810
it refuses to recognize papyrus as a

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,280
font in the first place it's just gonna

00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,730
sit there in the white why would that

00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,180
happen

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:00,400
I mean papyrus sans is fine just make

00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:04,750
all the links hot pink you know just a

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,490
subtle thing that's harmless do what you

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,240
want I kind of like this idea again of

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:12,040
like making experiences worse for people

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,930
you know sometimes sometimes you can

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,460
kind of unlock some new ideas there and

00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,280
you can kind of like find these new

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,660
treasure troves of weirdness and and you

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,130
get a little bit of perspective as well

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,230
you're kind of going down this rabbit

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,940
hole of making something worse and you

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,860
can kind of get a good perspective and

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,419
thing like oh you know everything's not

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:32,679
that bad really

00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:34,179
this is a great image of a pop up you

00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,619
know everyone has seen these on the web

00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,749
Google is kind of penalizing for

00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:39,039
penalizing your your search ranking for

00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,989
hitting a web page with these pop-ups

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,179
this is like demonic spawn of a pop up

00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:45,669
you know that because it's got sound one

00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:47,739
that's like checkbox amazing it's kind

00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:49,359
of selling itself it like consumes the

00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:50,409
whole screen I've had to build pop-ups

00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,799
like this before I've worked in

00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:55,989
advertising I I don't fully believe in

00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,549
like the the self-righteous web

00:18:55,989 --> 00:18:59,080
developer where you're like I absolutely

00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:00,460
refuse to build this because it's your

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,960
job sometimes you have to do these

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,710
things and I kind of like this

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,909
experience of making things worse again

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:11,649
I just keep saying and I'm a bad person

00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:13,210
social media is kind of spamming is is a

00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:15,129
good example of that and this is this is

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,509
a website that I built trying to think

00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:18,159
like you know the pop up will come up

00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:19,539
and say like tweet this page we need you

00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,789
to share this like thousand Facebook

00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:23,049
Likes we need likes and I kind of built

00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:24,940
this library it's got like a little bit

00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:26,739
of subliminal messaging in the

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,960
background and wherever you move your

00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:33,460
mouse on the webpage the tweet button

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:36,100
actually sticks to it that's fifty four

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,049
thousand tweets right there I actually

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,179
have to filter it out of my feed because

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:42,639
it's annoying as it's really

00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:45,100
frustrating I haven't seen this in the

00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:48,340
wild but I actually am convinced that is

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,470
a very effective mechanism I should go

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,649
to the next like spam Kampf and be you

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:55,149
know report my findings it's weird like

00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:57,009
that it's making things worse it makes

00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:59,080
you kind of understand that you know

00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:02,289
everything is okay interactions a big

00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,869
one this is a website that I built for a

00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:06,369
friend who who has this app called

00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:08,289
authentic weather and it's kind of like

00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:09,909
a weather app that is it's a little bit

00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:12,249
brutally honest it's like it's

00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:15,249
rainy right now look outside you don't

00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:16,509
need to know the weather and that's kind

00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:18,009
of like a simple site you know it's not

00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:20,320
it's not too crazy it's got some like

00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:23,619
Instagram things get your sunglasses

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,269
it's very cozy and and this is this was

00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:27,220
kind of a nice web site to build it

00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:28,749
didn't look particularly bad it wasn't

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,929
all that sweet bones in the wrong place

00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:34,929
whoever built that is terrible yeah it

00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:36,879
doesn't really like represent a big

00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:39,039
challenge but it's kind of nice to build

00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:40,239
and and I kind of like to ask myself

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,020
whenever I'm building something like

00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,280
what can I get out of this

00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,600
whether I'm gonna go in a weird

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,030
direction and make something worse or

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,550
I'm gonna make something better what

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,170
what small amount can I gain where can I

00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,470
inject some creativity where can I have

00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:56,330
some fun and this was the button I'll

00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,010
let me zoom you know this was like the

00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,240
blue buttons on that on that on the side

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,530
that said like click this and you can

00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,770
download the app and click this and you

00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:05,150
can get the Android app and and I kind

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,290
of wanted to like put something fun in

00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,820
there so I kind of injected like a

00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,470
little bit of a story into this button

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,010
so when you hover it's like how are you

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,920
today

00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:15,350
I'm doing well thanks for asking just

00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:19,100
keep hovering it's a good life being a

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:27,280
button the work is hard but enjoyable

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:27,280
yeah it's great save me

00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,610
it's nice right it doesn't do it doesn't

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,110
do any harm like it's it's you know some

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,400
people can kind of breeze by this it's

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,440
like that little bit of surprise and

00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,850
delight and a little bit of fun and I

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,590
could take this out of the website and I

00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,360
could put it on like code pen or I could

00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,190
put it kind of in an isolated place and

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,870
I feel happy that it exists and I feel

00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,770
like a little bit proud that it's you

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,530
know that it's there and then it's

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,850
around and this is the nice way again a

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,010
kind of looking at things and looking at

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,480
interaction of course there is the bad

00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,190
way again that I keep saying that's like

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,540
always two sides this is what funny gif

00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,550
isn't it there's two sides of a coin

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,490
this was this was a library that had

00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:06,050
built gift links this was this was again

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,140
like playing with hover interactions and

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:11,230
the kind of thought was was like how can

00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,940
a computer kind of punch you in the face

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,680
so so when your hobby is like you know

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,850
there's orange orange like since the

00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,590
dawn of the internet the world has been

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:23,300
asking why a hover interaction so boring

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,730
only recently has a new paradigm arisen

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,120
to solve these emotionally crippling

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,500
problems designers call them gift links

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,190
this is my favorite gift on the internet

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,560
actually it's like a toy from the 70s

00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:39,920
60s maybe before toys were fun before

00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,800
the game boy and he's getting brain

00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,710
damage I'm sure of it trying to look

00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,330
like I'm having a good time it's a

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,170
little-known fact but 9 out of 10 UX

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,350
specialists

00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:53,480
I agree the gift length right a richer

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,740
more enhanced user experience which can

00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,730
be tailored specifically for the

00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,140
enjoyment of your audience and and this

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,060
is kind of like a library that I that I

00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,920
kind of created just to just to do this

00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,170
effect it's nothing really crazy it's

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,120
nothing really big it's on github with

00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,470
the rest of the stuff and this is kind

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,120
of a weird one like I got some emails

00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,280
like Tim you are actually ruining the

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,770
internet you're making the world a worse

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,710
place I kind of want to print that and

00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:20,450
just stick it on my wall and I've seen

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,700
that one kind of out in the wild it's a

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,620
bit of a funny thing sometimes I kind of

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,480
like exploring like the borders and and

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,350
kind of finding like weird little

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,400
browser quirks and things that you can

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,950
what did I say then that was funny I

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,440
don't know yeah it can kind of like jump

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,210
over these little spaces and and so this

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,380
wasn't this was one this is a website

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,990
that I built with the with the same

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:45,500
friend oh nice well it's all red and we

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,870
that's okay so this was like a website

00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,190
for like a beard oil and when I kind of

00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,530
go in it was like well I can put like a

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,750
little animation in the console there he

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,320
is like he's it's a nice beard and he's

00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,510
winking

00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,950
I spent 90% of the dev time on that

00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:02,360
project building that instead of instead

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,010
of the rest of it and when he was kind

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,380
of like Tim just play around like do

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,490
something fun do something weird you

00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,720
know that's kind of what I did I also

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,809
made the mistake of naming all my

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,450
classes off the types of beards soul

00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:16,340
patch like old Dutch that was the

00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,780
biggest mistake I've ever made it made

00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,480
everything way more confusing you should

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,850
compile it into that after there's some

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,710
good research though oh yeah so this is

00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,059
kind of like reaching over into into

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,000
another space and kind of playing around

00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:31,160
this is another one it only works on Mac

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,929
now like when I released this it's like

00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,330
Chrome patched the bug in like three

00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:37,100
days and it's like you're cruel people I

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,360
was around four weeks before that but

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,309
when you when you when you kind of

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,750
scroll up and down on a Mac or an iOS

00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:44,210
device you kind of noticed that little

00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,620
spring effect that it has at the top and

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,030
when you're looking in JavaScript you

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,860
kind of get a negative number back

00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,330
coming from the scroll position so I

00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:56,090
could kind of use that too when you

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:57,320
scroll too far on either side I could

00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,309
have something a little pop-up like a

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,559
little bit of a little bit of grumpy cat

00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:08,990
I was upset at Chrome I filed a bug I

00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:11,480
was like guys you're ruining my fun and

00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,770
they were way more serious than I was in

00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,780
that conversation so it didn't really

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:19,880
work out that we need to create this not

00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,280
really right there's no there's no real

00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,840
reason for us to do anything but we can

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,040
kind of come in and we can explore a

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,380
little bit and we can have a good time

00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,540
this is a website that I built ages ago

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,730
months years two years ago the useless

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:35,000
web and this was kind of like the

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,860
website that got me into weird stuff I'd

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,240
say like you know when someone's like

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,530
how long have you been a developer I'm

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,620
like I've been like an unprofessional

00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,970
web developer three years that's kind of

00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,640
my answer when you press this button it

00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,530
kind of takes you to these weird weird

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,540
websites this is a this is I don't know

00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,760
that's a weird that's not a fun one

00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:55,440
I'm just get something else this is just

00:25:52,760 --> 00:26:00,929
a purple screen I think the URL is like

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:04,429
random color there we go let's see well

00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:04,429
they're not lying there not lying there

00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:12,779
that had noise this was just a domain

00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,100
people kind of buy these buy these URLs

00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,990
and kind of put something weird on their

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:22,889
cat bounce this is gonna be fun you know

00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:24,960
it it's that like 49,000 tweets I mean I

00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:26,789
could just tweet that every single day

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:32,669
for the rest of my life and die a happy

00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:34,769
person anyway I could stay on here

00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:36,149
forever it's like a huge time-suck it's

00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:37,889
got it gets like millions of visitors

00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:40,289
and everyone stays for about ten minutes

00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:42,539
and I kind of like calculate it and it's

00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:44,940
like over one month that consumes us

00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:46,200
like years and years of man-hours I feel

00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,750
like I've made a negative dent on the

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,330
whole economy of the world which is

00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,470
something I'm very proud of personally

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,779
this was a funny little library that I

00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,860
built elevated yes it's kind of weird

00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,960
now because everyone's like oh you're

00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,000
the guy that did this like really simple

00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,500
thing but when you kind of scroll down

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,759
to the to the bottom and this I cut oh

00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,210
this is going to take you back to the

00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:05,210
top of the website

00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:12,739
elevator music some nice thing about

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,299
I'm convinced this javascript library as

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,320
the key to world peace kind of weird

00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:25,750
this is something that I was playing

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,100
around with recently nobody likes this

00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,270
some it's always hit and miss you know

00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,429
you'll spend a couple of weekends and

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,110
make something and people like oh this

00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,159
was really great like that elevated yes

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,940
and sometimes you make something

00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:38,590
anyone's like Tim go away and this was

00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,679
one I'm kind of scared to go to his blue

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,240
screen of death ojs and there's a whole

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,880
seven tweets there because it's really

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,320
kind of horrific and you include this

00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,700
when you start developing it was like

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,279
the dev tools have just been getting so

00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,559
good everything's been getting so easy

00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:55,029
and whenever any JavaScript error

00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:56,710
happens on your page it just wipes out

00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:58,990
the whole Dom it wipes out the whole

00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,549
head of the page it spams your console

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,390
so you essentially can't find out what

00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:06,700
the happened I mean and it just

00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:08,409
looks like a blue screen though that's a

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,789
nice picture right there hopefully it

00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:12,610
doesn't crash everything no it didn't

00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:14,500
that's nice so yeah you know this is

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,520
this is kind of like what I'm making

00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,960
this stuff you don't really like

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,370
thinking much I'm just kind of trying to

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,570
make something fun I'm kind of repeating

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:22,120
this point over and over and over again

00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,340
but I kind of have no strong thoughts

00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,720
one way or the other I'm not like big on

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,640
kind of arguing about these things

00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,429
because it is for our own delight and

00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,350
it's our own platform and we can do

00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:35,320
whatever we kind of want to do

00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:37,299
I found this function this is kind of

00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,850
coming coming towards an end I work at

00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:42,390
tumblr and I found this function in the

00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:45,970
code was like generate dolphins thank

00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,380
stop the presses I literally stopped the

00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:51,029
presses I was like I'm not doing

00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,029
anything until I understand what this is

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:56,710
because it's intriguing and and the code

00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:58,330
it was like in this far corner of the

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,130
thing I'm like kind of reading it

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,390
through and like it seems to be

00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:06,309
generating some kind of dolphin

00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:07,659
somewhere where are the dolphins and and

00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:10,330
I was kind of on slack it was like God

00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,870
generate dolphins function where did

00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,549
this come from

00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,309
I found it eventually in the in there

00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:16,809
audio player in tumblr when when songs

00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:18,010
finished the psychic dolphins swimming

00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:20,470
around you can kind of see it in the

00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,480
visualizer there somebody was like oh

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,039
that's a shark because the tail fin is

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,460
up and down I was like I come from

00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:28,840
Australia it's a dolphin let me but this

00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,620
is kind of again it's like the surprise

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,850
and delight you know don't be

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,650
to have a little fun with what you're

00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,690
doing don't be afraid to inject some

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,940
dolphins into your code put some weird

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,049
things put music to stuff make things

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,580
follow the mouse it doesn't really

00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:42,350
matter where you go there's no wrong

00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,160
answer and there's no wrong way to have

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,830
fun

00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,620
and kind of like coming to a close this

00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,620
was the deconstruction for that for the

00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,420
generate dolphins when dolphins cry and

00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,070
and I'm kind of a little bit sad now

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,850
that everything is kind of done but

00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,850
cheers thank you

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,610
