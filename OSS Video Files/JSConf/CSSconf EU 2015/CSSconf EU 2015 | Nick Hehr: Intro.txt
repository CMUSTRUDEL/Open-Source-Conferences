CSS and css3 and the CSS comp is part of

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,900
the CSS conf organization now it's a

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,080
whole organization originally inspired

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,830
by Nicole Sullivan for CSS comp in

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,170
florida in 2011 our 2013 excuse me and

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,530
is expanded so far has inspired so many

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,320
other conferences so the past this past

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,290
year they've had CSS conf changed over

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,759
from Florida to New York where I'm from

00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,829
and that was this past year it was an

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,479
amazing event and some multiple people

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,310
from which none of that are here today

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:42,210
as well we have CSS conf Australia which

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:46,770
I've heard and quoting here strongly

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:48,630
believe it might happen again maybe

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,790
around march or april of next year so

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,670

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,770
fun and hopefully it might happen again

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:17,640

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,060
we're here in amazing Berlin this is

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,980
actually my first time absolutely

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,620
outside the United States and it's been

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,770
an awesome week that I've been here it's

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,990
amazing to visit Berlin and see the

00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:29,720
places and all the all the great food

00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,360
and touristy things that I've been able

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,040
to do and great coffee by the way but

00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,990
we're also hearing this amazing radio

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:41,270
systems boom I think I pronounced that

00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:43,459
correctly ish and it may be wonder what

00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,290
happened to the other four radio systems

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,520
I mean we're here the fourth way

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,730
especially the third one we're going to

00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,620
keep in theme with three today and so r

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,350
audio system that I happen to be very

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,320
appropriate for the name maybe not

00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:01,209
location or a waterworks factory for

00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,350
those that don't get it try desert

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:14,739
speaking of dry humor and we're going to

00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:14,739
go onto movie puns so Dhaka

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:24,740
so I wanted to look into the movie

00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:28,040
trilogies inspired by css3 starting with

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,480
Mad Max with beyond pundir dome to give

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,390
you a little hint of what we're going

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,600
for today although as chrissy pointed it

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:38,240
out CSS com3 did not wait till the 4th

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,680
one to equal out as gender diversity and

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:47,030
get that going this event was almost

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,890
return of the JED if anyone and however

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,440
you couldn't make it this year so I came

00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,730
up and took his place some of the people

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,500
the audience who might recognize that

00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:57,590
this is actually the sixth movie

00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,720
technically but if you look closely at

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:04,370
the third one it's actually returned to

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:07,250
the six so that's a little strange and

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:13,760
you'll see that in CSS as revenge of the

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:17,390
sixth and we're also in the EU in Europe

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,920
and so we want to show the European

00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:25,430
movie series that have been inspired by

00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:31,330
CSS including before midnight and our

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:33,860
favorite three color series of FFF and

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,480
also we had those old school movies I've

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,430
been really coming out but actually may

00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,070
have kind of guess what's going on in

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:44,930
the future the good the bad and the in

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:47,630
line and I think one of Judge Smith's

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:53,150
personal favorites Indiana Jones and the

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:55,160
Last cascade so I believe it's happening

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,920
it's coming i mean CSS is dead if you've

00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,520
heard from anyone i'm kidding it's just

00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,140
God if speakers go on a little bit too

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,640
long today we're going to have to cut

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:15,010
them off for in other words at words end

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:18,470
oh yeah oh yeah one grown we got it and

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:22,070
also coming up in the future of CSS

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:25,700
might be the rising machines if anyone's

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:27,510
seen the grid io yet it's happening it's

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,270
they're taking over

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:34,530
and of course one of my favorite sci-fi

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:38,850
flicks matrix revolutions or with these

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:40,170
days matrix 3d revolutions of course

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,790
Michael Bay's always been a big fan of

00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,340
CSS if y'all didn't know the

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:52,110
Transformers series has been one of my

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:56,070
favorites I was a little stretch and so

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,120
today there's me a lot going on and so I

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,510
want to go over the schedule real quick

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,220
as we had this morning me up here and we

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,230
have a couple speakers and then coffee

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,300
and then a couple speakers and then

00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,460
lunch and then a couple speakers and

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,090
then more coffee and a couple speakers

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,830
then coffee and cake so the plan will

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,500
have closing remarks at a family photo

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:19,980

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,930

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:27,270
keep track of all those sets this URL

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,690
and so I'd like to introduce our first

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,700

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,580

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,740
her in New York and all the events that

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,500
