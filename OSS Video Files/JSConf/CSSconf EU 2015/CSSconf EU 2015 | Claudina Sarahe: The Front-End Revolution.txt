Title: CSSconf EU 2015 | Claudina Sarahe: The Front-End Revolution
Publication date: 2015-09-26
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2015
Description: 
	Claudina's talk explores events in the history of front end development that have lead to the bouleversement within the field. Despite what you might think, the revolution has nothing to do with the tools and technology. Twitter adoption isn't what started the Arab Spring; Node isn't responsible for JavaScript's renaissance; and Wikipedia's most significant accomplishment has nothing to do with the fact that they are one of the most visited, most trusted, human-powered sites.

Claudina is an NYC-based entrepreneur, front end architect, tech event organizer, and speaker. She curates SassConf and runs the monthly NYC Sass meetup.

great all right good morning so what

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,699
makes something revolutionary for

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,359
purposes of this talk I'm gonna propose

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,059
the following definition something is

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,420
revolutionary when it not only totally

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:39,510
disrupts the established order but it

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,989
replaces the established order with a

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:48,030
new order and thus it changes the

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:50,370
dynamics of everything around it the

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,100
discipline of front-end development is

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,539
continuing to change at a meteoric rate

00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,690
and in hindsight this isn't actually a

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:05,339
big surprise for ours is the discipline

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:08,790
that deals with the user people and how

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,830
they interact in their emotions and so

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,280
of course we're going to need more of us

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,680
as more and more people continue to get

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:25,799
on the internet and as our devices have

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:28,650
taken over and things are chaotic every

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,590
day we have a new tool new frameworks

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,820
sometimes it's absolutely exhausting to

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:39,600
keep up and in fact all of these new

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:43,409
tools are transforming our lives as

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,930
developers and designers they're giving

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:50,040
us these new capabilities that we can

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:54,360
turn into new opportunities and this is

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,219
actually what's important over the last

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,149
few years we've had to adopt to many

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:03,270
many many many many new changes and it's

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,600
these behavioral changes that we make to

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,890
keep up with our craft that's actually

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,840
revolutionary and that's because

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,940
revolutions don't happen when we adopt

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,580
new technologies

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:22,380
they actually happen when we adopt new

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,330
behaviors so what are these behaviors

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,370
that we've actually adopted right and

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,130
how do we go about understanding what a

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,220
behavior is so before we get into that

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:36,200
we're going to look at the doctor frog's

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,190
behavior method which is a model for

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,950
persuasive technology for developing

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,110
persuasive technology and dr. Fogg leads

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,450
the persuasive tech lab at Stanford

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,730
University and in the 90s his big thing

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,160
was that he published a paper that said

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,700
you know what computers might actually

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,130
be able to alter and change what we do

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,760
and I was kind of mind-blowing for

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,920
people so what is his model his model

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,030
states that behavior is actually

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,060
composed of three factors its motivation

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:11,610
ability and a trigger and all three of

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:16,410
these things need to be present in order

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:19,250
for us to do anything so first we need

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,750
to be sufficiently motivated and

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:25,410
motivation is really anything that gets

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,570
you to act for some you might be

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,660
motivated by money for others they might

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:33,989
be motivated by freedom and so given

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,239
that motivation is so subjective it's

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,070
actually not a good thing to rely just

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:44,220
on motivation to change someone's

00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:48,450
behavior second is ability and the

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,370
ability is a bit of a difficult one to

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,590
explain it really has to deal with how

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,440
simple or easy something is and that

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,330
varies individually for a person for

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,000
example if a task at hand is going to

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,250
take ten minutes and you don't have ten

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,890
minutes then you aren't able to perform

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:09,090
that task even if that task is

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,870
relatively easy for you it isn't so

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,640
persuasive technologies really focus on

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,380
lowering ability lowering that barrier

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,580
to entry no matter what so that it's

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,970
easy for anyone to get into it unless

00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,970
Lea triggers

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,120
which can be squirrels for some people

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:32,030
depending who you are they can take many

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,590
forms so a trigger can be anything such

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:38,509
as like an alarm or a notification a an

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,000
article that you've read that's

00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:42,979
prompting you to do something and there

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,099
are three characteristics two triggers

00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:49,699
that make them successful first we

00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:52,009
actually have to notice them second we

00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:55,699
have to associate this trigger with a

00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:57,740
target behavior and third when it

00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,050
actually happens we have to be

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,139
sufficiently motivated to perform the

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:08,349
behavior so it looks like this on a

00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:11,780
graph basically if this line is behavior

00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:14,449
anything that happens here will result

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,789
in a successful behavior and anything

00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:20,300
that occurs in here will result in an in

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:22,490
successful behavior so you can see that

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,650
the easier something is to do with lower

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,490
motivation now you're gonna capped it

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:32,810
cap get more people but the harder it

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:35,840
gets some more motivation you also need

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:40,009
to require make sure that it's easy to

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,740
do if something requires a high level of

00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:44,599
motivation and it's hard to do very few

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,599
people are actually going to be able to

00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:50,229
do it so you keep this in mind when we

00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:54,379
start to take a look at how our tools

00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:56,629
use this persuasive technology model to

00:05:54,379 --> 00:06:04,639
get us to use them and adopt their

00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:07,969
behaviors so now we need to back up a

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,990
little bit to the mid arts to take a

00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:14,779
look at how behavior how our tools

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,569
utilize this model to to affect our

00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:19,879
behavior and because we're talking about

00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:22,789
front-end we don't actually have to go

00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:26,210
all the way back in time about 2005 is

00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:27,770
2007 and there was a lot of sort of

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,770
rumblings happen in web development

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:34,039
we're coming out of the web standards

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,589
movement in 2000 javascript and CSS at

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,730
this point in time are really poised for

00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:39,380
some change

00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:44,450
it's kind of difficult to navigate the

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:47,390
web so there was a bunch of new

00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,040
JavaScript frameworks and they were all

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,320
aimed at addressing the API

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,060
inconsistencies that we were

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:59,470
experiencing as web developers and in

00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:04,490
2006 john resonating released jQuery and

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:08,240
it wasn't the first framework that came

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:11,870
out we can see that they were actually a

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,260
bunch of them but jQuery did three

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:21,230
things that none of these other tools

00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:23,690
managed to do in time first had a really

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:29,930
really simple solution to Dom

00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:32,810
manipulation second it released with

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,610
really good documentation there were

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,710
libraries that came out before for

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,660
example of the prototype library that

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,700
was adopted in rails it didn't have

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,980
documentation for the first year or so

00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,880
that makes it really hard for anyone to

00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:50,390
jump in and figure out what to do and

00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:53,030
lastly when jQuery launched it launched

00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:57,620
with an invitation for people to

00:07:53,030 --> 00:08:01,820
participate and to contribute and by the

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:06,440
second day someone had already released

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:09,350
the first plug-in and this was amazing

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,920
this was the first time that you could

00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,900
do this and John's response is to say

00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,630
you know what I'm gonna make this a

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,570
really big thing I'm gonna ensure that

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,580
we have a place for anyone to contribute

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,920
their code and that it's easy for them

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:30,080
to do it because he realized the value

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:35,599
of what was going on so J's jQuery

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:38,660
success is the fact that it took a very

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,599
simple approach which allowed anyone to

00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,430
join even if you had sufficient

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,830
motivation and at that time period we

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:48,500
can say that our motivation was

00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,779
incredibly high it was a nightmare to be

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,750
working on the web

00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:57,779
secondly good documentation making

00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:00,870
making it easy the ability lowering the

00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,800
ability and this invitation to

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,980
participate

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,600
perhaps a trigger and perhaps the other

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,740
triggers were just the articles that

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,020
were coming out now it's still the

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,440
number one open source framework in use

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,600
and there's been a lot of grumbling

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,790
whether or not we should continue using

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,560
jQuery I'm not going to go into that in

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,830
this confidence thing in this talk I

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,930
leave that up to you to decide but the

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:32,089
really important thing is that these

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:34,550
three design decisions paved the way for

00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:38,399
big revolution in front-end development

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:41,760
and it led to other projects like node

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,440
and react and all the amazing things

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,839
that are coming out in JavaScript now

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:55,339
which is why we have these week-long

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:55,339
conferences all over the world so

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:02,520
contribution has always been a major

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:05,399
part of back-end development it's kind

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,920
of a big tenant of the web right but its

00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,579
foray into front-end development is very

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:16,829
very recent and in CSS since sort of the

00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:19,170
UX world this is even more recent so

00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:21,720
around the same time that jQuery is kind

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,959
of picking up speed CSS on the other

00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,640
hand is really ready for its Renaissance

00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:31,200
let's take a look at where we were about

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:34,020
mid odds somehow we had decided that 960

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,060
pixels was the best way to design our

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:44,970
websites and the only way to design our

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:48,180
websites we also had ie6 7 8 9 who knows

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,490
how many other browsers and we were

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,880
finally really excited for this thing

00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:58,920
called css3 that was going to help rid

00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,800
our HTML of a bunch of tag soup but what

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,329
did that introduce a bunch of vendor

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,140
prefixes because all the browser's

00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,510
couldn't decide how

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:11,730
they wanted to adopt it and who had to

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:15,390
deal with that pain we did right so it's

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:18,360
not surprising that we wanted new things

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:21,630
and additionally here comes the

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,850
smartphone completely about to change

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,070
every notion that we have a best

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,570
practice and we start developing these

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,900
new techniques for dealing with things

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:33,720
like smacks and object-oriented CSS and

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,360
BEM and conventions that are trying to

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,980
save our life and so it's really no

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:44,130
surprise that preprocessors arrived and

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:46,380
much like jQuery and JavaScript there

00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:50,580
were a ton I didn't know about these but

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:56,280
I CSS P P DT CSS a bunch of free

00:11:50,580 --> 00:12:02,160
processors because our need was was

00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:07,880
evident but there were two that really

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,880
edged out and how did that happen

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:18,630
the reason is by the same design

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,350
decisions so SAS was always kind of

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:24,180
touted as one of the more powerful ones

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:28,620
but it had a really big contender less

00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:30,750
and less adoption and Jake in excuse me

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,200
in boot shop is one of the reasons that

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:37,860
I think it continued and once SAS picked

00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,860
up the CSS syntax it made it much easier

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:45,260
for anyone to come in and to collaborate

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:48,030
so we can see that we had the motivation

00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:57,150
but SAS was a little more difficult to

00:12:48,030 --> 00:13:01,050
use but it did edge out and last year it

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:03,300
won the game changer award and recently

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:08,040
there was an article published that said

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:14,820
that a 66% a front end people are using

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,650
SAS today which is huge but it took some

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,510
other things

00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,670
well SAS

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:22,460
was sort of answering our problems for

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:26,000
dealing with vendor prefixes and making

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:28,210
it easier to write CSS I feel that it

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,260
wasn't until compass came along and

00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:36,440
provided a way for authoring writers

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,550
ourselves to contribute and it was a

00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,100
little complicated

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:44,840
we grumbled at first we had to learn

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:48,770
Ruby and how to make ruby gems but it

00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:51,590
ultimately paid off and now it's even

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:55,070
easier to contribute this things like

00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,840
libsass where you don't even have to

00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,690
worry about packaging up and creating

00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:03,620
ruby gems anymore as long as you build

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:07,180
an extensible framework your sass file

00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:12,200
can be included and used anywhere and

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:15,620
it's amazing right we now have an

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,020
amazing amount of tools people are

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:23,410
creating new things every day we're

00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:26,870
experimenting and this was this is new

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:30,070
we couldn't do this before we were

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:33,470
writing blog posts and trying to share

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:37,100
tips and tricks but we couldn't share

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:40,220
our code and aside from joining the

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:46,070
working group there was no way to really

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:50,180
affect change in the language and what's

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:52,640
even more incredible is how these tools

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,340
are now influencing the parent language

00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,460
and there's a bunch of amazing new

00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:02,000
things coming out in CSS level 4

00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,750
we've got variables in CSS where did

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,480
that come from

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:09,080
that came from sass that came from

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:12,560
pre-processors we have mix-ins

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,770
we have grids we have blend modes there

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,990
are so many amazing things and yes I

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:20,870
don't necessarily have full insight into

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:24,130
the working group so I'm sure that they

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,360
are developing ideas on their own but

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,430
I'm also positive that they're looking

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,440
at the changes in the community to make

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,270
those decisions you can also see that

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,370
with

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:36,640
recent release of epimer script six and

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:40,240
how it took a lot of its new features

00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,830
from CoffeeScript why did CoffeeScript

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,260
come out because we were tired of

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,540
writing a lot of j/s and there was a lot

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,670
of inconsistencies that CoffeeScript

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:54,460
nicely packaged away for us so we could

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:59,410
do things the right way and this is

00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:06,700
incredible our tools are lowering the

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:09,310
threshold for finding new ideas and by

00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:13,150
doing this they've opened up tremendous

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:16,810
opportunity for finding for for new

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:18,790
things we're free to experiment we can

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,370
get out there we don't have to rely on

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,920
these larger institutions and this is

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,700
very new this is this participatory

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,070
innovation that we're talking about our

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:34,000
tools have created a participatory

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:36,310
culture and our traditional rules don't

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,760
really matter anymore because we can

00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:43,870
move ahead of them and this is

00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:46,170
incredibly important because it's the

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:50,260
ability for collective participation and

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:54,130
collective action that are really the

00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,860
necessary ingredients for change our

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,800
tools have enabled us to try radical

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,550
things we're creating environments in

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,770
which people can get things done and

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:11,470
we're doing this while being encouraging

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:13,959
and supportive and welcoming so it was

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,750
really fascinating for me is when you

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,390
start to look at the growth of our tools

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,750
in the adoption and you can do this in

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:25,120
Google Trends we get this really

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,570
interesting distribution which tends to

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,800
look like a power log and in network

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:35,010
science this type of graph of behavior

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,480
represents a small world network and

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:41,290
small world networks our networks that

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:45,010
are built up of many nodes that are

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:48,660
connected to each other and they have to

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:51,910
incredibly evolutionary advance

00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:55,390
advantages the first is that they're

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:58,630
resistant to damage and the second is

00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:01,450
that they disseminate information really

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:07,030
well they act both as filters and

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:10,390
amplifiers so what's incredible is that

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:14,020
perhaps without us even really noticing

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:16,980
it we've designed our front-end

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:23,050
communities for growth and resilience

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:26,980
and so given that we are so skilled at

00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:30,580
creating such a resilient Network one

00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:33,960
that values the uniqueness of its

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:36,580
members and the people within it and

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,510
given that we can do so in such a short

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,980
amount of time

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:43,840
oonh really is a decade ten years I

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,570
really believe that we have a lot to

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,480
contribute back to society

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:53,680
beyond just great websites and

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:58,750
experiences citizens the world over are

00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:01,840
already calling for change and I believe

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:04,780
along with many others that in order for

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,440
this change to happen it's only going to

00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:12,160
come through a participatory revolution

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,560
and I also predict that we're gonna see

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,850
a very big change from solving technical

00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:23,260
problems to more interpersonal problems

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:28,480
about the people and who better to take

00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:31,720
part in this than us we are successful

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:36,190
practicing models of participatory

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:40,540
culture it's not we may take this for

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:43,630
granted but it's really incredible not

00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:47,470
everyone works this way not everyone has

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,300
the ability to work this way and so

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,720
maybe we can put the same design

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:56,220
decisions that we've put into our tools

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:59,700
into making cities better into improving

00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,700
education systems

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:09,409
code literacy holds immense power it's

00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:12,570
more than just a job or a career change

00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:16,889
it's this ability to participate in the

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:21,899
largest human connected network that's

00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:25,710
what the web is it has a culture it has

00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:30,090
a history it has a social structure and

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:33,419
it's shaped by each of us so it's really

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:36,359
up to us to decide where we want to

00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:40,559
create these opportunities and what we

00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:44,179
want to do with them and it'll vary by

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,889
what we can do it can be as large as

00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:50,970
organizing this conference and bring us

00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:53,820
together to talk and share it can be as

00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:56,749
small as taking the time to mentor

00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,659
someone and help them write a blog post

00:20:56,749 --> 00:21:05,190
release the plug-in it doesn't matter

00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:09,960
what it is what matters most right now

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:11,309
is that we keep creating because this is

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:20,039
what's going to determine what comes

00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:24,629
next and there's less harm in that so

00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:27,509
please make up and while we do it

00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:33,359
just remember to continue to be

00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:38,809
inclusive and welcoming because if we do

00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:42,359
this if we will continue to innovate and

00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:44,759
given what we've just observed I really

00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:50,279
believe that our innovations will

00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:52,549
continue to be revolutionary thank you

00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,549
