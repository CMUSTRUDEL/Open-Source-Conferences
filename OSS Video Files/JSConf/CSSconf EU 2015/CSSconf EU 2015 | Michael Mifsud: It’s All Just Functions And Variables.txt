Title: CSSconf EU 2015 | Michael Mifsud: It’s All Just Functions And Variables
Publication date: 2015-09-26
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2015
Description: 
	Michael’s talk, It‘s All Just Functions And Variables, will tell the story of how weeks of being taunted by nonsensical compiler errors and a supportive community turned him, a "lowly" front end developer, into a core contributor to LibSass - a large C/C++ project. He will unravel the stigma that "front end developers aren't real programmers" which propagates throughout the industry and into the hearts and minds of fellow developers.

Michael will convince you that regardless of whether you write CSS, JavaScript or COBOL, you are as much a programmer as anyone on your team or the intenet, and that it’s not our languages that define us but our willingness to learn to master our domain.

Michael is a front end engineer at 99designs where he focuses on performance and tooling. He is a core contributor to LibSass and the Node-Sass project lead. He also started the MelbCSS Meetup and is an organizer of CSSConf AU.

awesome hey how it's gone so uh yeah sir

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,090
I am zypher if if you know me probably

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,500
owned by that but since they're all here

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,309
and we're all friends and glee Michael

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,570
and I really love what we have in our

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:34,860
community it's kind of special in that

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,380
they're very few communities that are

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,700
open to sharing and having events like

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,469
this and like as part of that part of

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,210
the team that runs this is confer you I

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,489
with some other great people of you here

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,410
and Glenn he'll be speaking later and I

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,980
also helped run one of the bigger front

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,329
end meetups back home in Melbourne and i

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,770
really love up and saw some of that we

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,210
can share our code and we can all learn

00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,370
from each other and really build on the

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,840
shoulder of giants and as part of that I

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,899
country the projects like a lib

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,600
sassanids us but this is anas a stalk

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,100
I'm not here to tell you how amazing

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,909
sasses but they should use a SAS or not

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,369
this is actually a story and it's my

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,580
story and it's a story of all about how

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,750
my life got flipped turned upside down

00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,640
I'd like to take a minute just sit right

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,640
there I'd tell how became a real program

00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:34,900
so I want to start with a smaller side

00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:36,729
so back home in australia until the end

00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,000
of primary schools about the age of 12

00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:42,580
13 your entire schooling you work in our

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,869
pencil you never use pens and the idea

00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,369
is that in your final year of primary

00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:46,810
school you go through a stink will

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:49,030
depend license and you have to prove

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,680
that your handwriting is legible enough

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:56,740
that you can use a pen and not make

00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:58,270
mistakes and uh so I got my pen license

00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,759
I was the last one to get my pen less

00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,289
instead of my entire level and to this

00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,080
day I'm pretty sure I got our obligation

00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:08,200
because I deserved it and since about

00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,119
the age of 12 and so if we think back

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,410
this is like looking back in my life

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,860
this is kind of I started programming

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,810
very early know by the age of like eight

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,880
or nine I was very plainly things like

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,850
basic making like really simple bit back

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,230
bitmap pixel games that kind of stuff

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,000
and then not long before that not long

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,890
after that I learned HTML because it's

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,970
kind of really simply need a notepad my

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:33,549
computer is really terrible and this

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:35,410
kind of worked and I she was about it

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,390
was about this time that I got my pen

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,769
license so at this point i could

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,269
probably pretty confidently like to

00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,549
relatively basic languages i get some

00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:44,140
stuff done yo comped earlier high school

00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:45,070
i start messing around with like hello

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,750
world apps and really kind of

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,170
command-line apps in like python and

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,370
moving on to things like c and then in

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,500
very early high school i discovered

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,700
flash i just got to blue my vines i

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,470
could actually see what i was doing no

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,360
more hello world No More CL eyes like

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,400
really pretty interactive stuff other

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,660
than flash actionscript like that kind

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,180
of blew my mind Zac object orientated

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,310
programming inside this action script is

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,829
a pretty language there later in high

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,620
school we had a part of our schooling we

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:13,299
learn like Excel and Word and like the

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,549
built-in like vba language in that and

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:16,630
from that moves like some of us are

00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,299
really curious that playing a visual

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,640
basic and then you know this web person

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,260
kept eating at me so I found out his PHP

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,030
and got involved in like sitepoint stuff

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,340
and our big on PHP at the time so I

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,870
learn how to play with the web then

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,670
unique comes around and like we all have

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,650
to do java the web car disappears for me

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,420
for a while but i can't i can't get away

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,520
i keep going back to it so I learned

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,640
jquery

00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:43,440
not JavaScript jQuery I'll proudly say

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,330
that so then I got a job writing PHP and

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,260
jquery for a company after dropping out

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,370
of uni and I started messing with a

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,380
c-sharp was like an internal project we

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,990
had that people started using foolishly

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,260
and then we moved on to some Ruby stuff

00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:00,810
and then like I couldn't get way from

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,180
this web thing later on I start working

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,280
like an agency moved mostly to front end

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,560
stuff i started doing ere you ç sister

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,960
HTML got really excited yeah something

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,610
some javascript stuff that eventually

00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,020
leads to things like node and then like

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,400
I got really the performance and anyone

00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,540
like worth their salt performance wants

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,520
to know everything about how everything

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,870
is working so you like engine X and a

00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,170
passion you're tweaking things and like

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,670
how can I make this faster oh then it's

00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,260
like our map start getting bigger and

00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,970
bigger bigger companies like this

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,100
setting is crazy it's all over the place

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,510
how do we how do we manage this just

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,450
stop playing with sass and they removed

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,830
for to today and like I was using react

00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,260
and like this all seems kind of crazy

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,360
like who does all this all these

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,070
languages and but actually have been

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,890
really simple because they all spring

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,080
from the stink like c-style languages so

00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,090
we look at it something like a C++ for

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,060
example which is like one of those big

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,340
boy languages and we look at me see

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,960
things like all right we can figure out

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,510
we got like a variable assignment here

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,520
we've got like a function like that

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,110
we're taking a string you're adding the

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,580
input of the function to another string

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,200
or defined and returning that and just

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,910
calling that function it's pretty simple

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,470
code for like this like any language I

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,180
don't know kind of weird thing and this

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,760
is like we see like the string keyword

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,950
which is like we assume as a type like

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,420
we know our strings are that's all right

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,590
that's pretty bad it's nothing too

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,630
difficult but then you take things look

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,130
at javascript and like let's pretty much

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,140
the same thing right you got a variable

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,060
yet the VAR keyword a set of the string

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,320
like about the type anymore we're still

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,910
with the function the function name the

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,110
function parameter we're still plussing

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,820
two strings together returning I strand

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,080
calling a function that's like all right

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,090
well this is pretty straightforward

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,860
we've got a PHP and like this is almost

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,750
exactly the same thing we've dropped

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:41,070
afar and added like dollar signs and

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:43,770
otherwise its exact same code take this

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,180
to SAS exact same thing like we've taken

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,890
the function return web with that symbol

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,120
in front of them but yeah under the

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,660
covers are all kind of the same things

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,810
what this same

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,670
heritage lanikai you moved towards you

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,440
you are fast your language is anything

00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,760
like Ruby where it's like all this

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,350
things made the code readable a now gone

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,700
and you kind of like if you've seen like

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,110
the previous examples you have rats

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,040
going on but jumping into like this like

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:10,320
all right they've taken it too far so

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,280
it's like it's not it's not hard this

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,590
programming things actually really easy

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,020
like that language is really language is

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,670
so easy but actually the whole thing of

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,290
like learning how to program is hard

00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:25,050
like what is a ruby isn't whatsapp HP is

00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:27,270
it was a javascript ism and so the last

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,070
four years I transitioned almost

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,780
primarily to entirely front-end

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,600
theyselves the hardest one market finds

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,040
most enjoyable problem and things like

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,440
an interesting start running meetups and

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,880
hang out entirely more fronting crowds

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,800
then we'd hire more developers in my

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,720
current job and they'd never seen me

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,340
right back anchored so you can send

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,430
questions is like you can do this weird

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,650
debates like is X even program you CSIS

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,490
exit programming like what I wanted to

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,680
do a real code why you're doing this

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:57,000
front-end thing like you seem so smart

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,980
what are you doing with your life this

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,420
is like this this is pretty pervasive

00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,650
and I think about this in like what is

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,760
your programming it's like in the front

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,230
end with the lowest maintainability

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,140
scaling issues that we do on the back

00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,820
end we're so he's doing a bunch of

00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,340
operations here we care about we care

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,300
about performance yeah and it we have

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,169
two things like they have to worry about

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,430
we have to worry about compatibility

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,080
they have to wear BEC compatibility or

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,490
cross-platform like that code they write

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,770
it on PHP runs in that server it's

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,120
always going to work on that server very

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,740
little is going to break it and we had

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,210
this like a whole array of things such

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,169
different browser to browser versions

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:29,250
like a lot of a significantly harder and

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,350
so I pondered on this for one really

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,900
kind of bugged me and I bumped into this

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,400
mention of the dunning-kruger effect and

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,460
it's kind of a two-part thing and one is

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,169
like as people who only know a little

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,150
bit about a thing can extrapolate what

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,610
they know and realize yeah well this is

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,230
easy like I can make a round corner

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,760
service I can make like a pie chart out

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,530
of gradient so I can feel this thing and

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,150
I could do like there's so much I can do

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,710
because I can do this really tiny thing

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,970
and they don't have you don't know

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,280
enough to know how much you don't know

00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,210
until you start doing it and we start

00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,200
list and browse the whole time like this

00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,980
one's really simple when you start

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,610
messing with it like

00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,440
is really hard and the other side of

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,020
this and the really kind of toxic part

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,850
that I find is people who are who are

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,830
good at something assume everybody is as

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,150
good as they are and so they belittle

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,740
what they know it's like well I know

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,270
this everybody knows this so it can't be

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,710
that hard and you put these things

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,690
together and you have like the whole

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,830
idea of like front-end ebbs people time

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,070
when our programmers and we believe

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,750
we're not programmers this is kind of

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,860
this thing that's kind of bugged me for

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,470
a while it's got an inspiration behind

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:32,130
this talk of like wow why are we

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:34,500
considered programs so in 2011 i joined

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,840
copy nine on designs and we had this

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,700
like ad hoc look was very developed

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,850
during very small team we had like

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,070
multiple generations of the UI and like

00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,360
as you can imagine PHP devs riding

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,240
front-end code it was everything you

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,830
imagined it was an unpleasant was a mess

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,660
and I joined as a back-end developer

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,520
saying that when you care about the

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:57,510
front end I'm there this is what I want

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,980
to do so come around 2012 and we decided

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,570
all right when he does responsive thing

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,220
is kind of cool we need to do it so he

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,530
did a responsive rebrand started working

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,320
on this thing and I convinced them we

00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,640
got to do SAS like used it before it's

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,130
incredible he's going to save us so much

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,500
time and we started building our

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:16,320
internal and internal framework based

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,520
off foundation and because Royal

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,060
Engineers we build a framework for

00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,110
engineers and as a result things were

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,510
good for a while we understood we were

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,880
doing like our PHP guys can write our

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,260
CSS and like it worked and it was nice

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,150
and like everyone could take second

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,730
languages we're using like using SAS

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,380
like an API for the most things but as

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,720
this happened we got more and more code

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,540
and as we all know compilation times

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,650
just like blew out like I won't pull at

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,990
like six minute eight minute compilation

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,310
times brought into my compass magic but

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,950
that like tuna compilation times was

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,090
kind of brutal and I back in this one no

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,080
part of its like what are you doing it

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,520
used to work for us she CSS so I we had

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,280
enough and we SAT la vista latest thing

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,990
called lib sass the idea behind it was

00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,330
like it was the Ruby such project taking

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,550
a C++ an assumption like of it since

00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,440
it'll just be faster like there are

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,360
other really great benefits of this but

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,740
the big thing was like we can put in C

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,920
we'll make it fast of all the problems

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,540
and then Iraq have super fast ass

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,070
alright we played with it for a long

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,510
time and we just couldn't get there like

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,550
the basic phone mental features were

00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,560
missing so you can even polyfill I was

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,459
like ah variables of Oregon like that's

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,870
a problem so we kind of played this in a

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,940
bandit because a killer backbone we want

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,699
to come back to it and so later that

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,000
year I went to the first caps s in san

00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:34,730
francisco and this was my chance like I

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,490
had questions for these people so i was

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:41,709
there i ran into chris Epstein who is

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:45,260
one of the main riders of SAS along with

00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:46,639
Natalie and I ran into Hampton who was

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,430
running camps ass but also it was like

00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,649
the original inventor of SAS and the

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:54,019
person who had the vision for lib SAS in

00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,329
the first place and then I ran into Erin

00:10:54,019 --> 00:11:00,769
who was the person Hampton convinced to

00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:03,649
write lips ass so I had questions for

00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:05,329
like why why is that in nerd aren't i

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,820
fronted to change nerd like this is days

00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:09,050
are like grunt to the thing and like why

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,279
not make it a nerd things we don't play

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,570
together have one big nice things really

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,839
know it's faster than Ruby let's just do

00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:16,040
this and I was I also had a head full of

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,149
steam like I'm gonna come back on a

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,560
write this like I've started thinking

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:20,060
about it pretty intensely we'd run

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,720
accessorize full time for to use at this

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,040
point bring this framework and I talked

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,240
to Hampton he goes you could totally do

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,640
that you could definitely write this a

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,680
nerd but just know how much time this is

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,730
this the next to use your life like

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,079
there's so many edge case you have no I

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,390
how much work is going into making sash

00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:36,920
do it says does and to start messing

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,149
with it none like well I don't this

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,910
fills back at that in Kruger fact it

00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:41,720
feels easy but it's not like all right

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,890
now look so why is it taking so long

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,500
then why is this pretty bad for years

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,670
like it was almost no progress and it's

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,120
like well the intersection of people who

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:52,730
write C++ and CSS is zero like nobody

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,260
cares this happens because I'm paying

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,079
somebody and I've stopped paying him and

00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:00,709
I stopped happening it's like all right

00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:03,800
all that it's legit so come back home

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:06,230
2014 I'm like I don't think I have

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,240
enough of my life to write a note

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,579
version of this like so just about the

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,139
bull I could I'll just I'll do some say

00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:14,260
this let's get it working I've taught

00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,040
myself much languages let's just do it

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,720
completely well I didn't know a single

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,660
thing about C++ I could never analyzed

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,810
supposed to compiled it was really scary

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,850
to me like C++ is like that's the

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,430
boy language like he'll write operating

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,990
systems and games and like this is it

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,340
when I think my programming is like I

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,830
miss my on the web but these guys are

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,210
really these as a building things it was

00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,490
kind of scary thing for me a long time I

00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,350
put it off for a long time I purpose but

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,900
figure I let's just do this ragama go

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,550
start the adventure and we got to get

00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,980
started like thinking back my university

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,510
days like what is the scary thing my

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,890
suppose what what do I know I know it's

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,140
a compiled language which like for most

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,550
of like the server's like it's all run

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,310
time it's kind of happens as you do it's

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,650
pretty it's interpreted what languages

00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,540
have a doob lot more work initially is a

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,580
lot of upfront costs but it's kind of

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:05,740
weather run faster and there was this

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:07,900
linker and it linked to things yeah I

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,250
actually still don't know what that does

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:15,010
really i'm not close to some pain I

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,350
don't need to know I don't so there are

00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,589
make files so I'm try to think back to

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,029
like surely we can't be to diverge from

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:23,890
front and the back end like okay I do

00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:25,620
the same thing so I'm thinking back like

00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,089
so make files are essentially grunt for

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,920
C or for unix people like before those

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:33,190
JavaScript there was Mike and then we

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,770
decided laughter JavaScript grant the

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,110
grunt make you know preprocessor

00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,580
directives like this is a he's a

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,920
relatively complicated and I don't

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,030
understand him completely but everyone

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,080
looked through the lips I source code

00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,400
noises he's include everywhere is

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,200
included I'm like all this is obvious

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,390
this is just like import right this is

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,860
we've done this before there are some

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,150
differences with the MER spot like I

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,240
don't you dinner this is going to work

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:57,460
the same way I'm is strictly typed which

00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,170
is open first example it's like we're

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,060
going to define our types like our

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:06,450
coolest place virus string we sorted

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:08,440
good how many times can i really be yeah

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,360
so it's kind of the same thing we kind

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,320
of I get a sharp like this it is just

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,660
functions of variables as pretty

00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:18,700
convinced this should be too hard got

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:23,680
ahead of files and these are whoa sir

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:25,600
java kicked in skip this version cool

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,310
so we have our header files and our

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,960
header file sir I try to think it was

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,460
like like doesn't your bow or mpm like

00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,170
they're not but they're on the way they

00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,850
express intent it's like this won't work

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,370
without this thing that I've told you I

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,720
need like all right well I already miss

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,220
them too much I'm gonna get by without

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,370
touching them so it's copy and paste

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,110
what i see so you do a quick sesh lesson

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,870
so the big feature missing from SAS that

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,779
we really needed with SAS maps and so

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,190
sassa the data structure called lists

00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:53,350
unless we're kind of see in CSS is like

00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,760
space separated thing like any kind of

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,410
shorthand like paddings or margins

00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,570
essentially we should was list inside of

00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,920
SAS and we have a bunch of list

00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,920
functions we can find a list of this

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,570
becomes like an array essentially being

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,279
cool ends and say give me the first item

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,620
in this unlike other languages it's one

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,180
indexed I zero indexed but it's pretty

00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,240
simple weeks we've all done is kind of

00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,970
stuff so we have maps and maps a kind

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,870
like your hash map or impeach page still

00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:21,670
in array so Christ simple here we have a

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,410
list of values we have a hash of values

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,910
the map values we can like name the

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,490
thing we want which is better than we

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,279
can just say I get me this thing like by

00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,630
name and this like it we scream at this

00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,490
for years build one of the since ass for

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,170
so long and I finally landed but live

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,940
SAS was just so far off the ball that we

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,350
this is the thing we need to dump I

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,270
framework was based off maps I figure if

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,910
we could just do maps then we gonna we

00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,610
can get there we'll touch there this is

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:47,440
my girls on a work on a bringing SAS

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,800
maps into set until obsess trying to

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,540
figure it out and uh so the way this

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,650
works is every think would suspect like

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,029
I said test Suites a whole different

00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,650
project and all it takes is a bunch of

00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:59,050
SAS files and turns when the CSS files

00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,790
and compares them like if the stuff

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,140
you've given the same sass file if

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,830
you're British the same CSS Ruby says

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:08,020
does you've passed so I call right easy

00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:10,300
so a first step was creating a poor

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,740
quest like let's create all the all the

00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,209
specs of the map functions the big map

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,560
API let's write all the specs we know

00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:18,760
it's going to work and this got merged

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,649
and like all right like getting stuff

00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,149
motion up and sauce is hard so have a

00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:25,209
team wants like once your stuff that's

00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:27,459
pretty cool so getting that PR Matt

00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:28,899
merge made me feel really good like I

00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:31,870
admit I seem like a little giddy at the

00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:33,550
time was like wow this happened so it

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,320
gave me this rush of confidence and in

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,440
that moment I felt like this possible

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,050
maybe I can do this yeah

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,200
spicing is easy i got this this is this

00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,510
good fun is easy now boys a doubt creeps

00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:48,250
in and you're like they've put their

00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:54,140
trust in you you better not screw up and

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:58,490
then it sinks in I didn't write C++ I I

00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:01,450
turned SAS into CSS my cat walking on my

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,860
keyboard could have mistakenly done this

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:06,020
but it's okay I've got this has nothing

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,480
to lose like they're not expecting a

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:12,439
pull request like if I pull it off it'll

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,319
be a fantastic and surprising but what

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,640
if the pr sucks what if they can tell

00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,810
them afford immediately one of my shitty

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,480
code is out there for whole world to see

00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:25,850
forever we're not going to do i like all

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,949
rights so what if it sucks all right I

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,660
tried they're good people they don't

00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:31,490
want it to help just do it I've talked

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:35,150
to them it's okay like it's all going to

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:37,790
be all right so I'm going to get into

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,900
how I started so not knowing see I jump

00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,910
into the code base and I figured all

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,830
right maps are kind of like lists like

00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,910
we see in the purchase same thing so

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,700
I've just started throwing some code at

00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:49,040
the wall like let's see if it sticks so

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,380
this is our samples from original PR and

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,400
I out it take a short look just so you

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:58,880
can find the pattern what's going on

00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:01,490
here it's a bit bit more of it don't

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,300
lean in the code but we can see they've

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,770
got bring in maps in here done it again

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,780
same kind of thing and this is what I

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,670
call like CP DT this is a pattern that i

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,950
use to really get this sorted and what

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,950
it is copy paste driven development like

00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:25,789
like we just take a short look like

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,740
anyway you saw the keyword map you saw

00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:28,970
the keyword list because maps are like

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,190
lists I figure if I can just make maps

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,669
do a lister then what if i'm a bit let's

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,990
push the same thing the slight

00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:37,490
difference here is like you maps the

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,539
keys and values not just values like

00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:43,269
otherwise it's like two lists right

00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:47,870
let's move forward so the next one was a

00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:49,639
cedd so usually when you write code and

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,129
you get an error like we've seen SAS let

00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:53,269
go you know it's out of it's out of

00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:57,200
bounds you've asked so a third element

00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:58,869
the recent third element yeah useful

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,600
error message you kind of find your code

00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:05,419
c++ when things go wrong things go wrong

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:09,320
look just like it's broken figure it out

00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:12,649
I'm like what am i doing how do I get

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,419
how I get pasta sick so go do this I

00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:16,100
discovered a sink with gdb which I just

00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,779
overflowed and just got a missed I know

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,029
three commands and three commands are

00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:21,710
always using that work every time but

00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:28,999
you some like this and it's like all

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:31,490
right all right okay sure I'm seeing OS

00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:34,669
some sink symbol I'm saying very scary

00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:42,070
words in there what have I broken

00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:42,070
whatever done yeah well 11

00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:53,370
there and a half there it is so that's

00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,840
the thing it's actually broken this

00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,940
tells me off somewhere in this print

00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,410
thighs function is like an issue this is

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,090
the stack trace 'ok most languages to

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:03,060
give you this is useful thing and you

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,880
get there eventually a bit like yeah

00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,640
it's still scary every time i see that i

00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,220
kind of panic a bit so that's compilat

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,520
orange of development and I'm this is

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,810
because it is a compiled language like

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,010
it knows when things are wrong for the

00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,780
most part before they're actually wrong

00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,830
then kind of stopped you and if it

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,870
wasn't for this I don't think I ever

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,160
would have shipped my lips I stuff in

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,590
the first place because I think I no

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,660
idea what I was doing this is like weeks

00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,700
and weeks of work eventually had a pull

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:34,040
request had some help people I work with

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:37,410
who were great and uh so I did this and

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,850
Wow bye-bye a series of like unfortunate

00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:42,000
and Portage's their behalf they merge

00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,230
this code and I product explicitly say

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,240
you probably should emerge this like

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,100
this is a start someone better than I am

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,170
can fix this but take what I've done

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,470
like I don't like I says they are don't

00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:54,270
write C C++ but they're excited who

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,620
starts out like they wanted emerges to

00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,030
go to that there's big pork quest people

00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,340
really happy and it's a really big

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:05,250
problem the big form was I'm terrible at

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:06,390
sea and so when we looked at while I was

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,810
writing the map functions i was riding

00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:11,130
him like like two sets of lists if you

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,170
know a basic computer science a terrible

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,970
idea this is like the map get function

00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,920
turned to SAS but but sip athis code was

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,080
doing it's like oh you have a map and a

00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,460
key was looped through the entire map

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,320
each time find the key the matches bring

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,990
value back it's pretty naive we've all

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,720
done it before but this is crazy slower

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,920
this is terrible code and it was so slow

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,650
in the fact that thing the first

00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,560
iteration was a couple orders magnitude

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,700
slower than Ruby so no matter how fast c

00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,670
is like there's no substitute for

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,430
terrible code so ox why they ship this

00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:45,510
and the thing is like performance as a

00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:46,560
feature to them nope i open an issue

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,340
saying like i know it was on this think

00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,930
is terrible but uh wind up we have

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,280
multiple iterations i'm coming here is

00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,220
saying like I know why it's broken right

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,460
Darnell how to fix it and see an ad fix

00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,470
it in JavaScript

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,080
took a bit of research and we file got a

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,760
second PR and stuck down a third or

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,860
fourth iteration at this point it's like

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,090
lightning fast but one of the fastest

00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,409
parts of lib sites like this map thing

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,240
it's got a lot of work into it it's like

00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:11,919
a lot of work people perform me like

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,940
people who wrote really fussy libraries

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,649
and I bench alert had user api's and

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,149
it's perfect fit sure it's really

00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:20,679
important to us the community wanted

00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:23,440
maps they didn't care how fast they

00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,820
where it's much better use them so

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,770
 something like this this is

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,710
comparison of going around like lib SAS

00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:32,529
is two times slower than / CSS written

00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,610
in JavaScript I'm wearing C so we're

00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:34,690
doing special isn't really terribly

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,090
wrong well they're just a really great

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,850
engineering and like we know this we

00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,470
know it's slow it wasn't really

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,110
concerned make it true phosphorus like

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,669
we're bring on the laurels of CC is fast

00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,679
so we'll be just be fast by having being

00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:48,850
in C and doesn't always work out but

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,220
like we give people the features they

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,919
wanted so we've all seen stuff like this

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,809
and like we've all seen it in regards to

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,549
CSS but more accurately it's like things

00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:59,590
that don't understand I don't know how

00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:01,029
to do a thing it's painful like I don't

00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:05,770
know what I'm doing was he yelling at me

00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:07,809
how do i fix this so yeah this is like

00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,960
the one of the new iterations and we can

00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:13,120
see in the previous version where like a

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,610
second or so slower than like rubies ass

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,020
and a new version I think this is the

00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,730
version we were actually equivalent we

00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,789
got as fast as Ruby SAS was super

00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:24,010
excited well I was because I fixed my

00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:29,130
terrible code so come around the tour

00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:31,270
2005 this is out there and um through

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:34,840
continued continued poor decisions on

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:38,080
behalf of Hampton I'm now one half of

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,350
the core team of lube SAS ah one-third

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,279
start an OC by the way we've added a new

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,679
contributor now which is really awesome

00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:46,630
the team is growing I'm most another

00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:49,149
project lead of nerd sauce which is a

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,590
JavaScript project that's mostly see so

00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:51,909
that's the continuing theme I'm up here

00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,370
on stage in front of you all talking

00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:56,440
about how terrible em as a programmer

00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,490
but yes still a programmer and so I've

00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,929
talked about these techniques for how

00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,610
you can take what you know in SAS and

00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:01,779
JavaScript and write like big boy stuff

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,600
like C and see if I see not be afraid

00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:06,840
and like words a cheap so let's write

00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,840
some code

00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:17,770
I sinner so we're going to write some

00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:21,110
lips s today so yeah clap when it works

00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:23,060
so this is a compact function it's

00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:28,040
pretty simple or does the text takes a

00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:29,840
list so we have a list here of we have a

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,190
list here of values you know some truth

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,700
you some folks who knows from JavaScript

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,500
false is false null is false the guy

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,240
just takes this list now if you've

00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,380
actually passed in a list having

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,630
personal issues return the list for

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,340
years like no up but it's going to loop

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,650
through your list find things that

00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,150
looked Ruthie add them to a new listing

00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,470
return on your list it's like returning

00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,260
the stuff is probably Nolan didn't mean

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,610
to have in the first place so that's

00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,620
cool this is the SAS version of it and

00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:59,930
if we run it we can see it works like

00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:02,870
false is gone and null is gone this is

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:04,370
cool work turning SAS into c plus

00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,620
bhaskar and then executing that and

00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,660
bring back out SAS a super slow like we

00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,970
want native methods run like this end

00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:14,230
function like and these loops how fast

00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:16,670
these because they're in C++ so that's a

00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,680
let's bring some the c++ the way I would

00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:21,380
program obsess so if there's anyone here

00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,120
who like who's bosses are controlled by

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,010
the youth lib toss not just they should

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,740
leave this is the house is how we write

00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:31,040
this covered it's not very personal way

00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,930
to lose facing code right here so like

00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,590
we could probably guess this thing is

00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:38,360
empty good functions as a functions file

00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,580
cool so the one thing we do know like

00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,320
when I know a lot of sass so for me this

00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:46,780
is kind of easy I know I need something

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:49,870
this is like a function called index so

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:51,860
if you look like index index is a

00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:54,020
function in SAS it's kind of like

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:57,140
finally we're in disarray this thing

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,330
happens let's keep looking where

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:04,820
anything's look like these that look

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:07,820
around index function alright cool so we

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:11,630
can see this kind of looks like a texan

00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,730
a list if the list is empty return the

00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,890
list sure we've done this before loop

00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,630
over the list if it equals x we pass the

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,809
internet number cool that's kind of like

00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:22,440
some what we're doing we're looping over

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:24,240
taking a list of returning a value what

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,039
we want to do we want to turn a list not

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,120
a number and that's similar to the

00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,629
append function which is actually right

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,480
here so what's this doing this is a lot

00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:34,350
of code let's talk about that right now

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,809
so it's like all right so we want

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:39,450
something it's kind of like index so

00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:41,730
it's just copy and paste this we only

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:46,620
wanted to call compact not index let's

00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:47,759
just a change that the compact we don't

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,749
want to value we just on the list so to

00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:55,009
get rid of the value all right so we

00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:58,249
just guess that this is creating a list

00:26:55,009 --> 00:27:03,840
we don't want value so they can go away

00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:08,580
so this means be sure cool so this is

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,600
comparing if the value at i equals the

00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,980
value we passed it we don't have a

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,869
values obviously don't want this I

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,399
really want this like so what we're

00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:15,629
checking for is like existing truthy all

00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:20,100
right if it's truly you want it we don't

00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:23,779
so to your incest like is this true

00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,980
right if this is true then do a thing so

00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:26,940
so such a stirring and number stop what

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,039
we want below if you see the pattern

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,169
here like it's very similar to our SAS

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:36,299
code of like loop through if do

00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:37,559
something return so in a pen just kind

00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:40,350
of like the list stuff we need right

00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:41,999
it's like results well you know result

00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,039
of same in every language that's thing

00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:49,289
we're returning so let's create one of

00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:50,369
those setting a length we don't know the

00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:54,749
lengths let's get rid of that just

00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:58,830
defaulted deserve sure whatever that

00:27:54,749 --> 00:28:02,309
means cool so what we need to do is add

00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,389
a new thing to list a like we know this

00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:09,450
is going to do this let's figure it out

00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:12,960
the odd thing to list sure it's probably

00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:15,029
going to work we don't have V but V is

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,619
this value right so let's just copy and

00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:21,210
paste that it's probably gonna work I'm

00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:26,249
gonna return the results like this part

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:27,779
we know where programmers cool this

00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:28,790
looks like almost exactly like I'll SAS

00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:32,330
code

00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:36,620
oh I miss one day I compact what I

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:38,150
could've been bad I do have the license

00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,890
but I upgraded and they doesn't work in

00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:44,210
three-point oh my stuff's Birkin um sir

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,680
all right let's run this again actually

00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,450
no it's not run graduate compile our

00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:53,120
code so we're not grunt file or I'll

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:58,880
make file that looks cool oh I compiled

00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:00,110
did not expect that all right so comment

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:06,680
out our compact functions when we're

00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:08,860
using our code let's run it I'd save

00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,860
that

00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,510
No

00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:26,610
there we go so yeah it's spitting out

00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,750
the word of compact which that we want

00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:31,020
it all so it actually not finding our

00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:33,660
functions at all sorry I done something

00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,360
wrong look our index function what's

00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:39,300
this index sick sure that's a search

00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:44,180
four letter code base ah there we go

00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:50,870
we've missed some stuff all right turn

00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:53,870
index into compact whereas we missed

00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:58,670
let's string index now we just did that

00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,670
yeah there we go stick your header files

00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:16,230
all right it's Rick impalas o this ere

00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:19,720
drug development right in front so

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:21,250
contact all right so obviously there's a

00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,860
thing called compact some wasn't exists

00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:28,930
but when our index exists so let's

00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:31,570
search for index what do we missed these

00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:34,740
don't look right that's on the score

00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,740
index nope

00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:51,549
there we go you can tell us in their

00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,549
comeback in the earth

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:06,600
let's do it hey no air is it compiled

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,240
but it hasn't done a thing we've noticed

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,810
like know what our folks is still there

00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,330
why is false there obviously our if

00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:17,780
check isn't cutting it just go back to

00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,780
our code

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:31,990
it's the head of file right so I missing

00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,220
something here this if check is

00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,440
obviously failing like things that are

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:43,320
folks are coming in true so it's like a

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:43,320
look for those oh how people doing false

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:53,820
is false there we go now we're doing it

00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:06,549
so if this room is false we want if it's

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:17,220
really one if it's true right like it's

00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:17,220
not false yeah all right we've just C++

00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:28,979
wish it was a jerk that's how most of

00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:30,929
slips us gets written sir running out of

00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:32,999
time so we just come to today we have a

00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:36,649
new release loose ass coming out it is

00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:36,649
now the fast food processor out there

00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:41,940
we're now at a narrow after three major

00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,919
versions or almost a complete feature

00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,179
parity the new version which is on this

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,309
list there should be a complete feature

00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:51,989
parity with some edge cases I can hang

00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:54,690
out with these great people this is a

00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:55,829
Hampton Chris like this thanks these

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,389
people that I'm a will be up here and

00:32:55,829 --> 00:33:00,690
tell you about this stuff and you can

00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:03,450
use lips esterday know could have

00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:05,729
thanked Natalie who is in approach the

00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,799
person who runs assassin does or

00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:09,690
language design for SAS and like I

00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:11,149
couldn't have done this like I would

00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:13,320
never put that PR up if I didn't think

00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:14,729
like that be supportive like having met

00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,469
them before I having known the SS

00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:17,729
community like there's some great people

00:33:16,469 --> 00:33:20,549
in this community like has spoken today

00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,779
owner include inna were being like since

00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:22,950
meeting them off doing this work I Know
