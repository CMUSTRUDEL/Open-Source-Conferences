so high I hope everyone is having a

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,070
really great afternoon so I currently

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,470
work at automatic which is a company

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,830
behind wordpress com amongst other

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,019
things and I have this thread of

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,489
psychology running through my life

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:39,149
studies and career and code psychology

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:42,180
really really excites me and I love

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,680
doing experiments and I love trying to

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,620
work out how we can actually create

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,610
experiences that connect with others

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:54,600
that really really drives me so emotion

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,480
is a really really powerful thing it

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,660
drives us to actions it makes us feel

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,589
connected and kind of it's an essential

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,890
part of being human in one day we can

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:10,680
laugh we can cry and weaken sigh and our

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,040
range of emotions is incredible our face

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,460
and body show these despite quite often

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,009
trying to hide them we also have this

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,540
desire to associate emotions to

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,840
inanimate objects and it's something we

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,270
all do so my laptop for example if it's

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,369
not booting it's sad it's feeling grumpy

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,920
I associate those emotions with it and

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:35,070
if it works expected it's happy it's

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,640
having a great day and that's part of

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,430
the nature as humans we expect things to

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,350
have emotions and we all just demand it

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,439
because without it we kind of feel a

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,600
little bit uneasy and pics are actually

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,180
recognize this in their first official

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,119
short film called luxo jr. and in this

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,299
film there's a little lamp which plays

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,219
while the big lamp looks on it's kind of

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:04,920
a father and son short in the form of

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:07,229
lamps and animals feel emotions too for

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,489
example look the sheer joy of this dog

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:13,530
running we get comfort in this kind of

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,600
cycle of emotion so

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,940
we recognize joy and then that feeds

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:23,700
back into our joy and this is pepper so

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,709
pepper actually is a humanoid robot

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,680
designed to live with humans but it's

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,989
not task-based pepper actually is a

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,650
social robot designed to live

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:37,890
autonomously and to converse recognize

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,319
and react to your emotions and beyond

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,360
being super super cute pepper actually

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,330
as an illustration of how we connect

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,680
through emotion an emotional companion

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,330
is actually a perfect fit and because I

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,519
like robots I like to show another one

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,010
for you today and this is power this is

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,340
actually a therapeutic robot baby harp

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,310
seal and this is designed by intention

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,810
to be cute and it's to have a calming

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,470
effect and emotional response in

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,019
patients of hospitals and nursing homes

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,060
so it's kind of the animal version of at

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:16,350
the robot version of animal-assisted

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:19,410
therapy power actually has tactile

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,230
sensors across his body that responds to

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:25,410
petting and it can stimulate such

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,380
emotions as surprise happiness and anger

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,750
and it also has sound similar to the

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:35,850
baby harp seal as well as a sleep and

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:39,780
awake cycle so we connect with it humans

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,970
need we need emotional responses that

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,470
connection I kind of think we're a

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,130
little bit like the primate needing a

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,769
hug the world is a scary place and we

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,359
need that connection we have a range of

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,049
emotions and by understanding emotions

00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:57,720
in others we then relate to them samosas

00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:02,220
actually are the feelings of the mind

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,609
just like physiological sensations an

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,010
emotion actually has three components

00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:11,370
these are physiological changes such as

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,420
increased heart rate behavioral response

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,100
such as whether you stay or escape and

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,820
as subjective experience like feeling

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,890
angry happy or sad and the latter is

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,430
normally what we associate with being an

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,430
emotion

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:32,940
animation is four years touch the hearts

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,669
of us from picture to studio ghibli we

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,949
fallen in love with characters had a

00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:41,699
heart broken by ink and

00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:43,889
computer-generated images animation

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,580
connects on a level that touches the

00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:49,169
very human heart of us we dive into

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:54,539
those animated worlds and we often

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:58,199
escape into them as well studio ghibli

00:04:54,539 --> 00:05:00,090
to me show mastery in each of their

00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,910
films as far as bringing a sense of

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,250
delight goes this is actually an advert

00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,889
they did so this cat we can relate to

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,020
because it's beyond cute right there's a

00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,539
sense of delight in its playful batting

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:18,030
of the butterfly it's delightful to

00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:21,180
watch and it fills you with joy well

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,220
mrs. a complete contrast the web it's

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:28,259
never been very good over late interest

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:30,780
as a human interactions often cold clin

00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:34,949
clinical because it's not actually a

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,539
pixar film and it has in the past felt

00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:41,340
like the web was created for robots

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:44,270
rather than humans when you only have an

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:48,650
interface how do you actually show

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:51,810
emotion animation takes advantage of

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,449
facial features because robots even have

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,300
them right we show our motion on our

00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:03,030
faces but what happens when you have no

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:05,430
face so anime and manga actually have a

00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:08,580
unique visual language that conveys

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,470
character emotion and these range from

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,419
speed lines to cryin and something at

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,889
racal cat mouths it's a bit of an aside

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,020
but i'd like to share this with you a

00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,419
cat mouth is actually when a mouth gross

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,949
finds and looks like a cat and what it

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:25,229
means is the character is feeling catty

00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:28,199
so it adds a nerve element beyond the

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:31,550
facial expression to the animation and

00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,620
to us our understanding of the character

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,029
so a lot of you probably know the book

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,020
by disney called the illusion of life

00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:40,240
disney animation

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,900
and in that it set trial basic

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,210
principles of animation and these kind

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,819
of create illusion that the object

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,220
adheres to the laws of physics but it

00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:54,400
actually goes beyond that too emotional

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,780
timing and character appeal and I feel

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,180
when dealing with motion we can probably

00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,110
deal this kind of reduce the 12 down to

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,039
four and those i'd like to share to that

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:07,599
so the first of these would be

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:10,690
anticipation anticipation prepares for

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,599
an action this also focuses attention on

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:16,330
an object this could be really useful to

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,139
show a start of an emotional response or

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,849
arresting emotion and then we have

00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,370
timing and this is critical for

00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:26,530
conveying emotions and different

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,030
emotions have different times as well it

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,539
really can convey the character's

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:34,449
personality and then we have

00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:36,460
exaggeration this is a little bit of a

00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:38,349
double-edged sword because it can be a

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,419
technique that's actually overused but

00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:43,449
where motion is concerned some are

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,680
actually exaggerated and this is one

00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,810
that you can really play around with and

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,419
create an emotion in a static element

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,330
and then you have appeal which is

00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,460
essential for motion we have to find

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,400
something appealing so this is kind of

00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,130
if you ever played a kind of D&D this

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,590
was your charisma kind of amount in that

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,389
so we have less of this then you

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,830
wouldn't simplify so in Disney terms

00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,969
this would be kind of the villain you

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,979
wouldn't want to sympathize with the

00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:14,039
villain and this is also seen as a

00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:18,099
captivation of a character summation

00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:22,300
experiences connect with the user they

00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:24,400
bring moments of delight an interface

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,560
can touch you as you interact with it

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,650
and when you do that you actually create

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,089
a meaningful in connection and that's

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:37,360
priceless this is how your users become

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:39,550
really really engaged they create

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,380
feelings with your interface and in a

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,539
sort of way they're kind of bond with it

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:47,170
as a result their investment increases

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:49,209
as they use it so when thinking about

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,730
emotion I really think you can learn a

00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:54,490
lot from apps and I like to share a few

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,680
today so this is katina and in this this

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,660
little face look at them as you kind of

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,850
interact their eyes and you get that

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:04,329
kind of feedback you relate and you get

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,160
that kind of interaction a monument

00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:08,589
valley I think can teach an awful lot

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,019
about atmosphere and every single

00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:13,510
interaction layering up to create an

00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:17,199
emotional response and a feeling of the

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:19,120
world an up coffee shows emotion is it

00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:21,250
adds up so it kind of gets more and more

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,920
and then it's kind of this whoa kind of

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,699
as it fills up its so excited to be full

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,740
and I couldn't not show flappy bird

00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:32,440
because the flappy bird to me shows

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,570
personality right from the start so kind

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,060
of it unload the little captures ready

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,699
to go and to die horribly but it's ready

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:44,139
to go and then it refreshes again ready

00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:47,139
to go and die horribly again so we have

00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:51,370
this ability to create the same animated

00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:53,589
emotion in CSS since animations really

00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,230
exciting to me and the potential is

00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,360
thrilling and there were tons of

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,420
experiments like this amazing dozing

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,550
bird but what about the big of you what

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:09,399
about crane an entire experience in CSS

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:12,790
the sites we create we should see as a

00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,740
chance to move the user maybe it's for a

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,410
reason like this site which we're going

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,839
to dr appt showing this we're going to

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,089
have the demo from this tonight what

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,750
reason touching someone on an emotional

00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:27,100
level is powerful in the past if you

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,220
wanted to connect with someone with the

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:35,470
same power animation does you use flash

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:37,690
or video this is moving it's making a

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:41,829
real connection with the human as you

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,660
use it and this site is how a simple

00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:46,209
button connects you with the rest of the

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,740
animation on the site I think at this

00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:49,630
button had a noise it will kind of be

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,819
boring because that's what this button

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,730
does as you interact with it and it adds

00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:56,680
to the character and the feelings that

00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,949
unites with those UI elements to create

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,750
the entire experience and knowing the

00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:02,600
voice of your site and the brand is

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,420
really

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,690
a foundation to know what to kind of

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,130
emotion you want to revoke and it sets

00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,319
your emotional tone if you think bats

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:16,220
Monument Valley how everything layers up

00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:18,350
to create that emotional tone those

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,860
examples are great but they're big

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:25,399
they're showcases it's what an entire

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,500
animated experience can be and summer

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,529
just experiments to test the boundaries

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,990
of this relatively new format what about

00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:37,759
smaller interactions how can we bring a

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:39,949
sense of delight to those so animation

00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,440
isn't just for Co pens or fancy

00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:45,410
animation flourishes we should be adding

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,290
it to the smallest of a UI how do we

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:51,440
take those exaggerations into smaller

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,720
forms so like all the examples before

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,120
when animation designs for motion is

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,630
thought of it tends to be in the sense

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,620
of that entire experience the lead role

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:06,079
but these large expenses are incredible

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,610
but look at this house lack uses the

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,370
emoji pecker that tiny little

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,399
interaction that you may hear connection

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,689
with that doesn't have to be big and

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,180
cold pen I'm not going to play this is

00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:18,889
quite a long animation however the

00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,269
cocaine button is a great attention

00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:22,310
grabber because it has different levels

00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:24,889
so there's initial kind of wobble and

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:26,689
then it kind of gets more and then if

00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:29,029
you really don't notice that it sends a

00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:32,029
notification box in so to me the

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:33,589
personality of this is it kind of tries

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:35,120
to kind of make a little cough tries to

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:37,160
get your attention then it kind of

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,420
shouts a bit and then it gives up and

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:43,279
calls its mate notification box in and

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,959
here's Co pen again I had to share this

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,350
because copán just has some really nice

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,829
tiny flourishes this heart unload

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,839
there's a kind of pulse and then when

00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:55,699
you click it it's kind of like you give

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,339
your heart away that's a really powerful

00:12:55,699 --> 00:13:01,639
and simple thing to do as you like

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:06,139
something and what's better than having

00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:08,180
toggles kiddie toggles I love this

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:10,009
because it actually shows how you can

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,680
simply add to previously pouring

00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:15,350
standard interface something really fun

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,470
and interactive and doesn't always have

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,630
to be cute but it's kind of nice

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:23,580
when it is and I just loves you change

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:25,800
from no to yes on this so I decided to

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,470
conduct a bit of an experiment cuz i

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,260
kind of like doing experiments how can I

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:35,040
convey an emotion through simple buttons

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,260
animation so I set myself a task to have

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,080
a series of buttons with various

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:44,070
emotions and then do a few tests to see

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,620
if people got the right emotion so first

00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,350
of all trying to pick what emotion was a

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,540
little bit tricky I knew I wanted some

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,340
obvious ones but I also because maybe

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,430
I'm odd i want to give myself a bit of a

00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:59,990
challenge so I decided unhappy and angry

00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:02,520
and then the challenge would be sad

00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,290
throughout of all good tests I needed to

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,070
set some conditions to really try and

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,570
get this way and I wanted to kind of

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,800
narrow down what I was doing because

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,630
there's an awful lot you can do have

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,070
animation as an awful lot that can cause

00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,950
bias and someone when they're

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:19,500
interacting so I decided to just use

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,450
ease in and out just use translates and

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,090
also to focus on purely just doing

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,280
simple keyframes I actually wanted to

00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:29,490
kind of get to the lowest denominator

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,110
and also want to try and make the button

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,180
emotionless in its design because as we

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,100
all know people are influenced by color

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,330
shape all these kind of other things I

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,630
want to try and focus on how the

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:43,770
animation could create the design that

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:47,070
the actual motion so I started first of

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,530
all was happy and as with all good

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,920
searches I started with animated gifts

00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:54,960
and I actually found I'm not sure if

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,480
this is a hamster or guinea pig or

00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,960
gerbil but this small furry happy thing

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,390
I found and to me this happy dance just

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,420
personify just made me feel happy as

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:09,960
soon as I saw it but I kind of thought I

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:13,200
could go happier than that so I thought

00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,630
about minions because minions just exude

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,370
they just have such happiness it just

00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,920
kind of is exploding for them as they're

00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:23,700
bouncing up and down so I wanted to

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,650
bring that into my button so I started

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,510
to think how the keyframes would look

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,920
and I did some really rough graphs

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:32,260
however this was me just time

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,769
think how it would kind of peak and

00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,720
trough so I kind of thought the happy

00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,130
button would actually be keen to be used

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,410
if you think of the minions they're just

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,329
not kind of just grinning that just kind

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,279
of can't stop it escaping they're

00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:48,160
bouncing so I wanted this button to

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,930
actually react on load imagine it'd kind

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,120
of be so happy it just couldn't help

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,740
itself so little happiness blips were

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,930
escaping and then when you actually

00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:00,100
interacted with it it will get even

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:02,440
happier so this is a happy button it's

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,959
kind of just kind of doing a little and

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,600
then when you interact with it it just

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:12,370
cannot escape so this is my version of a

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:15,670
minions in a bun so then I went back to

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:18,639
look at angry and I started think about

00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,440
how the angry button would appear and i

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,339
found this animated gif and you can see

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,570
the rock side by side of sheer anger and

00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:27,250
i thought this would be good to reflect

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,899
particularly in relation to the minion

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:33,370
button with the kind of up and down

00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:37,329
movement so i went back to drawing rough

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:39,399
graphs and i kind of thought that I

00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,589
wanted to attach a personality this time

00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,140
to its button beyond just kind of the

00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:46,390
minion I wanted to actually make you

00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:49,000
feel that there was a kind of a girl and

00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,680
a violent shaking so I actually thought

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,199
it would be a little bit like poking

00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,720
someone awake so it'd kind of be all

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,820
quiet and then it'd kind of be a girl

00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,620
get off is what I wanted this the kind

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:03,130
of anger so you kind of get that feeling

00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:06,400
and this is what I had with angry button

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:10,209
so you interact to kind of get off and

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:14,290
it kind of gives that feedback and then

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:15,850
it kind of a second so sad but and I

00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:19,000
knew just going to be a bit of a

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:21,160
challenge because sadness is quite a

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,309
wide range and it's quite hard to convey

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:28,419
and one person sad really isn't another

00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:31,650
person's sadness I did a bit of search

00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:34,210
and I found this heartbreaking Pikachu

00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,620
this kind of all the sad I can't watch

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:40,240
it for too long because it's just too

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:42,610
sad however this to me conveyed the

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,250
little trembling I just like that's just

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,200
a universal for

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,450
so I then thought about how that I would

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,890
actually look in a graph and it's kind

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,110
of quite you can see the difference in

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,870
the emotion in the grass I'm creating

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,760
and I thought this is kind of be a

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,880
reluctant button and I cited think of

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,160
how it'd almost be that sad sighing and

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,480
this would be on click and it would be

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,370
kind of reluctant there would be this

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,020
kind of time delay when we're going back

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:12,790
to timing this really would come into

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:15,490
play with sadness so sad Burton is

00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:19,360
actually really sad it's actually quite

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:23,520
a slight emotion but you interact its

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:27,160
kind of that's what the button does so I

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,490
then went on to test on some humans I

00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,200
did five initial 121 test because I just

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,760
wanted to see whether i was crazy

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,010
developing these buttons by myself

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,640
wherever I was actually conveying these

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:42,460
emotions I used cope n to share and I

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,480
asked a simple question of what emotion

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:48,010
does this button feel and I really want

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,780
to do some more after this if I wanted

00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,240
kind of a baseline by asking and then

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:55,960
refining and with that I actually

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,580
presented three emotions to the person

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,280
and ask them to select them and the

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,620
reason I did this was you could get five

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,840
hugging in lots of different words for

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:08,020
the same emotion I wanted to really try

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:11,350
and pin it down at least initially so

00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:14,290
his results happy Burton got five people

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,520
which I was really pleased about also

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,200
the feedback I got was really

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,920
interesting considering I base that on

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,809
minions which people said it was rushed

00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,730
excited and anxious anxious was

00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:28,120
interesting but anxious can actually be

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:31,030
very close to excitable happiness so

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,780
that was kind of on the money with what

00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:37,960
was said in an angry button or five

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:40,780
people definitely said that button was

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,790
angry and also what was interesting

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:46,870
relating to the kind of girl get off

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:50,830
people also said it was annoyed so it

00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:53,650
kind of was giving that feeling this is

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:56,340
where I got a bit tricky sad Burton all

00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:58,119
five people did say it was sad however

00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,859
people actually

00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,279
you were saying if I have to pick one

00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:05,349
it'll be sad so I don't I sad button was

00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,969
not a success and I knew this was going

00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:08,889
to be hard to sads actually some things

00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:11,739
that's really difficult to convey and

00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:14,589
the feedback was quite varied such as it

00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:17,349
was stoned it was sleepy reluctant and

00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:19,599
bored maybe that kind of applies to the

00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:21,909
same but it kind of indicates I really

00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,939
wasn't on the hannah on target foot

00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:27,669
being sad and one of the feedbacks I

00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:30,339
actually got was that happy and angry

00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:32,049
reminded them of their kid which to me

00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:33,879
was great considering I based on a

00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:39,489
minion and that kind of girl get off

00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:41,379
kind of childish thing so that's a fun

00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:43,359
experiment I like doing things like that

00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:45,429
and I want to do more of those emotions

00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:48,579
because to me it was really a useful

00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:50,979
experiment how can you actually take

00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:52,719
that into the interfaces you create how

00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:56,949
can we take that beyond those kind of

00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:59,889
cute angry experiments for buttons so

00:20:56,949 --> 00:21:01,979
invisible animation can be said to be

00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:07,209
the one that creates the most profound

00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:09,759
emotions well animation is good you

00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:12,099
don't notice that and a lot of the

00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,189
experiments I'm doing focus on smaller

00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:17,159
elements thats aligned this it's also

00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:19,449
about adding to the experience and

00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:21,099
causing reaction that subconscious if

00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:23,139
you think about Monument Valley again i

00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:26,319
keep on going back to it because it

00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:28,509
layers up to create that experience it's

00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,489
what animation film students what Pixar

00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:32,589
do it's what you do Ghibli do they add

00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:34,749
these layers to create the whole entire

00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:38,019
experience and that's what we can be

00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:39,519
doing the smaller elements so I did a

00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:41,879
couple more experiments that I'd like to

00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:46,269
share at the end of this talk with you

00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:48,849
and one of those scoffing buttons so

00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:51,129
this is I was trying to play around with

00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:53,529
how I could take a subtle emotion into a

00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:57,429
simple interface so what's the coffin

00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:59,919
bone it's quite simply in the form of a

00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:03,759
button so it's may be very English noise

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:06,819
but it's basically doing that it's not

00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:09,269
loud it's so but it's just enough to

00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:09,269
grab attention

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,530
and this is my version of a coughing

00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,800
button so it's kind of just in the

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:19,390
corner I want to play around with this a

00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,340
little bit more it's just my first stab

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,640
at coughing buttons but it shows how you

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:26,260
can just have a simple attention grabber

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,350
and the other thing I've side a look at

00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,480
phone calls n inputs and this is really

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,310
really subtle it's part of that layering

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,680
and adding two different things to how

00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:39,760
even an input could be just SAT there

00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,560
adding to that atmosphere the simple is

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,210
quietly waiting that's why it's called

00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,490
Zen it's just quietly doing its own

00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,590
thing and you're not meant to notice it

00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,080
until you interact and it stops moving

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,000
that's when you probably notice it don't

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,610
know how this is going to convey on the

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,480
big screen but it's just ever ever so

00:22:54,610 --> 00:23:00,700
slightly making a little bit of movement

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,740
and I almost wanted you to not notice it

00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,060
was moving but kind of register it's

00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:09,270
moving so you kind of get that feeling

00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:12,820
but you you don't know so all these

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:14,950
experiments are great and fun to do well

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,190
for me there but a lot of them come down

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:21,370
to feedback this is when the user

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,320
interacts and gets an emotion back it's

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,180
the same thing that we relate to the

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,370
robots we get that emotional feedback

00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:31,960
back while we relate to animals we get

00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:34,890
that feedback as well for example if you

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,630
click a button and you make it Angry or

00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:40,110
if you add input into a field and make

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,370
it hold its breath as you do that

00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:44,410
feedback isn't the only way to show

00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,030
emotion through CSS but it can be really

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,850
really effective one and quite a low

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:51,640
entry point humans we seek that

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:56,320
emotional feedback and this is a great

00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:59,710
way that we can interact through CSS

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,890
animation we can bring personality to

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:06,190
interactions buttons can be impatient or

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:09,880
happy a sliding panel might be eager to

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:12,390
actually be opened I'm input field might

00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,880
be impatient to have content added to it

00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:20,560
motion is powerful and we can really use

00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:22,890
it to connect to users motion makes

00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,820
interfaces more human

00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:29,010
and as humans we then connect with that

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:32,370
cleaner interface you feel connected to

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:34,380
is incredibly powerful maybe it's a

00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,840
grand showcase that tugs at the

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,100
heartstrings but we should be also

00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,680
looking at the smaller details and I

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,140
hope I've shown that today since this is

00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,210
really really powerful and we can bring

00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,540
a little bit of emotion to any aspect

00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:50,190
the interface so thank you so much

00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,230
listening to me I'm going to be around

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,690
all day so please come and say hi as I

00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:58,490
love meeting new people and I'd be happy

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,490
