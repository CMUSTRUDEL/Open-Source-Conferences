Title: CSSconf EU 2015 | Una Kravets: Photoshop is Dead!: Editing Images in CSS
Publication date: 2015-09-26
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2015
Description: 
	Unaâ€™s talk, Photoshop is Dead: Editing Images in CSS, demonstrates how we can use CSS blend modes, filters, and gradients to implement custom photo effects right in the browser. The talk helps us understand how blend modes work and will show us how to implement dynamic and accessible graphics within our own web projects.

Una is a front end developer on the IBM Design team in Austin, TX. She blogs, illustrates, is a core member of the Open Design Foundation, and started the DC and Austin Sass Meetups.

hello everybody

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:18,840

sounds like unicorn this is not the

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,039
unicorn emoji but there will be unicorn

emoji so that's super exciting I am a

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,050

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,660
has started this a CDC meetup nhx ass

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,279
meetup and I'm also a member of the open

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,989
design foundation but more importantly I

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,079
found this perfect tweet describe what I

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,480
do from Horst is and what I do is just

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,309
breaking the web with CSS and this talk

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,770
is a perfect example of that so if

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,079
you're here to see some breaking the web

00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,539
welcome welcome to get you in the mood I

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,039
have a video here I thought you was

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,600
getting to be a lady Photoshop it's

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,370
gonna be a pleasure to kill you or less

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,500
than your chrome in this presentation

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,829
give me a lesson in long distance

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,890
spitting anything you can do I can do

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,830
better I can do anything better than you

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,430
are you yes I can oh you can yes I can

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,799
oh you can yes I can yes I can all right

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,869
so now that you'll feel me now they were

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,900
all in the mood for this let's get

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:19,049
excited so last week I was in Vilonia

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,869
that is a huge thing of tiramisu it's

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,479
it's ridiculous how they feed you there

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,600
like it's insane I didn't eat it hello

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,640
and I promise but anyway while I was in

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,829
Bologna I won do some traveling so I go

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,200
online and go the Train Italia website I

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,990
don't speak Italian I'm so sorry

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,150
so I just had to translate the page for

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,689
Italian to English a translate of the

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,840
page

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,840
I still see Oh God I still see this I

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,030
could have blacked out um so here I am

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,890
wondering what does this say I thought

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,710
I'd translated the page why is there a

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,020
baby I just want to buy a train pass to

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,280
visit another city I've no idea what

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,590
saying and I get really frustrated

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,020
because this is an example of a designer

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,549
just throwing it like a comp together in

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,740
Photoshop and putting it online like

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,630
this isn't helping anybody here at CSS

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,770
comp we have over 31 countries

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,780
represented

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,830
that's amazing like coming clap for the

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:18,190
organizer is really quick for that

00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:22,510
Oh like this isn't going to help any of

00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:24,340
those people fine talk about loading

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,460
time so the average loading time for

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,680
Photoshop is 33 seconds but my favorite

00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,000
part of this is not just we have to wait

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,980
and watch the slowed screen that we have

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,270
nightmares of they also want to

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:40,150
highlight the names of the people

00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:42,280
responsible for this while we wait cool

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,410
thank you it's fine let's talk about

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,200
responsive design in photoshop we're

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,220
done talking about it

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,900
you came down with like a separate

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,459
application you could fake it but you

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,040
really can't do responsive design like

00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:57,370
you can do in the browser and then the

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,350
price okay that's a lot of money it's

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,120
240 dollars a year just for Photoshop

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:04,750
alone I created cloud the six hundred US

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,670
dollars a year it's quite a bit but it's

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,400
fine cuz I can go to flaming text calm

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,230
and just make all of these logos look I

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,850
have like 20 logo options right now I

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,120
had to pay zero dollars and zero cents

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:20,230
for Google Chrome and this is the worst

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,510
part so I remember trying to sign in to

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,190
browser what I'm - Photoshop while I was

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,780
on an airplane I was trying to do some

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,600
work so it's exciting required that's

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,769
fine I'm trying to sign up my team and

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,730
then I get please connect to the

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:36,160
Internet and retry I'm on an airplane I

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,739
don't have Wi-Fi so what do I do I hit

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,870
cancel are you sure you want to quit yes

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:45,269
I want to quit and then this is how I

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:47,410
feel about Photoshop from now on oh gosh

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,030
so this talk is going to focus on

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,709
filters and blend modes specifically and

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,150
we're also going to talk about gradients

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,500
a little bit but there is a vast variety

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,540
of things that you can do in the browser

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,459
instead of opening Photoshop to do them

00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,959
cutting images out there's so much so

00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:01,870
I'm just going to be focusing on these

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,820
few topics and before I move on just a

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,959
notes normally I would be using

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,700
something like post-assessment

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,000
autoprefixer to take care of my vendor

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,709
prefix thing but I'm using just a style

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,680
block with constant editable and this

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,000
demo and just vanilla CSS so I'm going

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,430
to have to do some WebKit filter

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,400
prefixing so just keep that in mind you

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:25,240
won't actually do that in real life so

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,130
starting with CSS filters the

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,199
compatibility with CSS filters is pretty

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,199
good the only browser that's really not

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,810
doing it yet is edge but um hopefully

00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,030
that will change so here I can seem a

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,410
little bit there we go

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,539
so the options that we have for CSS

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,630
filters are blur brightness contrast

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,639
drop shadow grayscale hue rotate invert

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,500
opacity CPN saturate so we have a few

00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,720
different options here and just to show

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,580
an example here some of the more

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,610
interesting ones I find are like drop

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,919
shadow because it takes this shape of

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,270
that image so here we have a PNG and if

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,099
I move this out a little bit you can

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,570
really see that this drop shadow is

00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:03,250
taking the shape of that image so

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,860
instead of a box shadow that just takes

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,720
the size of the box or it takes the

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,180
border size it will just take the size

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,919
of that image itself so that's pretty

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,210
cool

00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,479
blur does what you would think it does

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:19,409
it works with any really unit value here

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,210
so we could do like 0.2 m/s if we want

00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:24,580
any any unit value here so brightness

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,919
obviously anything that is greater than

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,060
one for brightness will increase the

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,159
brightness and anything less will

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,050
decrease it so a brightness of zero just

00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:33,430
makes it black another interesting one

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,849
that I will talk about the highlight

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,229
here is invert so invert also takes no

00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:39,880
parameters so if you have no parameters

00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:42,400
in there it takes it as value of one

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,710
completely inverts your image here if

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,389
it's an invert value of 0.5 its

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,280
completely gray scaled because the way

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,349
that you invert pixels is you take the

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,389
luminance value and you subtract it from

00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,770
one so right here when you do invert

00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,940
point five you're taking all the

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,180
luminance values and setting them

00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,190
closest to that 50% gray so the rest are

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,659
kind of self-explanatory grayscale key

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:06,190
rotate is another fun one that I can

00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:08,050
highlight so this you can play with so

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,570
here's like zero degrees and then I

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,820
could do like 180 degrees rotates the

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,940
hue of that color just on a circular

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:19,330
plane by the degree that you basically

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,250
set it to here so you can solve a lot of

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,229
really small problems by using filters

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,710
very briefly this is a blog post that I

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,210
wrote and I use the paper app so I use

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,919
the paper app and what happens in use

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,930
the paper app is you get this grey

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,310
background but I wanted to flow into

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,949
this white background a little bit on my

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,810
page so I just set this WebKit filter

00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:39,169
and as you can see all the images here

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,909
do have that gray

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,199
but instead of opening all these images

00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:44,300
in Photoshop editing them all

00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,800
individually I just had to add a WebKit

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,080
filter or just a regular filter of

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,539
brightness 1.1 I could have used a

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,180
contrast filter and it just makes it

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:55,580
flow a lot better into this document one

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,779
line of code beautiful thank you CSS

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,610
filters you can also have some fun with

00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:03,560
it because this CSS you can do fun

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,629
things like animate this is literally

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,819
five lines of code I'm using a hue

00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,279
rotate animation and it's creating this

00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:13,810
visualization just super quick super

00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:15,949
easy and something that's inherent to us

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,770
so blend modes this is where things

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,689
start to get really interesting so there

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,819
are two types background blend mode and

00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:25,580
mix blend mode and background blend mode

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:27,020
works on the background items within the

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,999
element so if an element has multiple

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,830
backgrounds you can use this to kind of

00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:32,990
channel how those different backgrounds

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,249
interact with each other so the support

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,139
on this is a little worse than filters

00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:38,960
em edge again doesn't really have much

00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,729
but it's getting there so mixed blend

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,219
mode is very similar with sports and

00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:44,569
this takes that element itself and talks

00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:46,899
about how it's going to blend in with

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:49,580
the other elements on the page behind it

00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,379
so all the blend mode options that we

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:55,189
have in Photoshop are listed here

00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:56,990
and CSS has a majority of these so I'm

00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:59,990
going to kind of walk through how those

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,460
work a little bit so the blend mode

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,889
types there are five different types

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,099
there's the darken modes group there are

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:10,159
light modes contrast modes Comparative

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:12,110
modes and composite modes so I'm going

00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:14,899
to use my balloon friend here to help me

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:18,649
explain this Munsell color system with

00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:20,689
web color names here so as you can see

00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,370
there is a rainbow projected on this

00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:23,839
balloon and if you look at these lights

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,819
from the top of the stage it's the

00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,680
lightness value that's the luminosity so

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,120
stranding it down the light and it kind

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,249
of becomes a cone of darkness at the

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,779
bottom now you can see the whole range

00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:34,729
of colors surrounding the balloon and

00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:37,849
the very inside of the balloon that

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,589
Center Point's is a 50% gray so no

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:42,079
matter what the line light can't shine

00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,430
in all the way it becomes a 50% gray you

00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:45,800
still have light from the top coming

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,149
down so the most saturated value is what

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,029
this balloon gets from that light

00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:51,800
projecting immediately thank you to the

00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,920
awesome light team here I also give them

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,920
around

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,890
let's keep that up there because they'll

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,740
help explain the blend modes when I keep

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,270
going but I figured I might as well take

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,820
a bloon off the loan use it while I have

00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,350
the opportunity so to explain dark and

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,250
blend modes I'm going to use the help of

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:15,440
vanilla ice and vanilla ice cream so

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,610
let's start with multiply ok we're

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,710
multiplying them are going to overlap

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,450
our images so the way that multiplied

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,240
works is it uses the luminance levels

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,340
that light level of the pixels in each

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,800
space of these two images and it just

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,750
multiplies the pixels um math terms it

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,640
just does a times B and this is a lot

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,230
like transparency so if you take Juve

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,060
entrace perÃ³n seized and overlay them

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,280
and then shine a light through that's

00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,560
what the multiply blend mode does so if

00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,270
your pixel value is 1 if luminosity is 1

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,490
it shines all the way through but the

00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,920
more you layer the darker it gets so

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,680
darken works in a similar way except it

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,360
uses the RGB values so if not as dark

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,270
because it's using the color range on a

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,280
per color a per channel basis to sort of

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,710
detect which colors should remain which

00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,510
which leaves so if the active layer

00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,430
pixels the active layer is the ice cream

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,560
here I'm only applying the blend mode to

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,480
that active layer if those pixels are

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,400
darker than they stay but if they're

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,130
lighter than the tones of pixels behind

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,380
them they're replaced by those tones the

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,810
last one is color burn which is the most

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,640
saturated of all of these and it also

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,310
uses the luminance values but it uses an

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,040
inversion algorithm to sort of have that

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,890
more saturated look so for lighten blend

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,050
modes we're gonna have a dog surfing and

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:31,130
a dog skateboarding who's the winner

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:33,650
here so screen blend mode is the

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,720
opposite of the multiply blend mode it

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,310
is inverting the pixel so how like I

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,380
mentioned earlier it's doing 1 minus

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,090
that luminosity value and then it's

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,740
multiplying that for both the active and

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,600
background layer and then inverting the

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,640
product of that so it's inverting it

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,700
again and this basically means that

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,430
we're multiplying the light pixels so

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,800
then lighten is using those RGB values

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,720
it's not as bright as screen and color

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,950
Dodge is the brightest so blows things

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,280
out the quickest of all of these

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:03,500
lightening blend modes now once we have

00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,060
the contrast group so here we're gonna

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,570
do oatmeal and a comic from the oatmeal

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,490
I really worked hard in these puns yell

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,560
alright so we're gonna do overlay so one

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,760
thing that the contrast group is a uses

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,350
a combination of lighten and darken

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,150
modes in different ways

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,970
and so for over like for example

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,910
specifically it uses both the screen and

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,220
the multiply blend mode both in half

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,380
strength and it takes those mid-tones

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,250
50% gray and just drops them so that's

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,900
how that works

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,600
soft play is a little more organic it

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:37,080
keeps those 50% mid-tones and then hard

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,700
light is the most dramatic so they all

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,700
sort of work in similar ways with the

00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,670
contrast group comparative blend modes

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,590
are next and so we have an oreo rainbows

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,820
this is my favorite group and then Tim

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:52,560
Tams for all the Australians here it's a

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,920
Tim Tam fridge I wanted to bridge the

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,660
gap because I want Tim Tams in America

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,050
anyway let's make that happen with

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,290
difference oh my gosh so this group does

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:07,620
something pretty fun so it basically

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:10,440
takes pixels that are on the same space

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,060
of the two values and it inverts the

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,830
pixels based on the luminance channels

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,720
on a channel by channel basis so you

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,670
take the active layer pixel and you

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,650
subtract it from the same layer on the

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,200
background pixel and for difference is

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,330
selective inversion where similar colors

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,890
will turn black they'll cancel each

00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,650
other out and turn black but it inverts

00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,660
it so the original point and use case of

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,580
difference was lining up transparencies

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,810
when you had the perfect black on black

00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,810
that's how you knew that things were

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:38,490
perfectly aligned exclusion is pretty

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,680
similar to difference but it has those

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,080
50% gray mid-tones so it's a little bit

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,750
lighter than the difference blend mode

00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,610
and then we have one last group and

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,890
that's the composite one mode that's why

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,440
I'm glad that my friends Klaus here is

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,930
helping so we've got the Wi-Fi password

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:59,430
pretty much so we got cat pictures as

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:01,230
promised and pupae laces um so this is

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,810
kind of interesting what happens here is

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,480
with the active layer so the lasers it

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,070
only takes a hue it keeps that hue color

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,440
that's mixing it with both the

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,540
luminosity and the saturation of the

00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,910
background layer so since the cats are

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,050
so bright it keeps that bright white so

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,690
I'm taking the hue and since they're not

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,670
very saturated

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,340
you shade is going to become lighter I'm

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:25,400
over top of the cats in this demo

00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,860
example so saturation only takes a

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,110
saturation of lasers so it takes the

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,270
colors of the cat so their eyes become a

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,790
very bright blue their fur becomes very

00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:37,270
very saturated but the value the color

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,260
value remains and so does the luminosity

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,720
so luminosity is going to look a little

00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:45,620
different than all of these this one is

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,870
taking just luminosity so the basically

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,820
the blacks and whites of laser image and

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,190
imposing the cat's coloring on top of

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,980
that the hue and then my favorite of all

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,810
these is the color blend mode so this is

00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,600
really cool because it uses both the hue

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,910
and saturation of the active layer so of

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,370
those lasers and slurring it on top of

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,810
just luminosity of the cats so in

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,070
essence it's like taking a

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,770
black-and-white photograph and

00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,660
overlaying that with a color image but

00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,400
the best part is the photograph doesn't

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,570
have to be black and white because the

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,390
browser is doing that for us

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,880
it's making it happen so anything you

00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:23,450
can just use to color on top of an image

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,740
with the mixed blend mode of color so

00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,270
you can do a lot of really fun

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,760
techniques if we look at that example

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:31,100
again of the header that I made for that

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:35,030
blog post something that we can do is

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:38,000
add like a mix blend mode of multiply

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:40,070
and it starts to really blend that

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,430
background this could be any color this

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,230
could be like a that's a blue color okay

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,170
that's cool we'll keep it at say a

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,970
purple um so we can make it multiply but

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,760
remember how it wasn't exactly white we

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:54,830
still had to do a WebKit filter to

00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,810
increase the brightness or the contrast

00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,120
let's do the contrast like one point one

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,040
and there it's flowing perfectly in with

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,470
the background we can do a hero Tate

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,940
some of those shapes might start to

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,060
change color we can really start to

00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,680
dynamically play around with this just

00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,390
like in the browser is probably more

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,770
like 130 degrees like that changes

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:17,660
another option is we can do a screen

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,610
blend mode which is the opposite of

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,980
multiply like we went over and then we

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,930
would have to go in and invert that so

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,300
you can really start to play around with

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,950
things just dynamically in your browser

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,780
and you can be super lazy about it

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,860
in fact I call the filet Z designer

00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,020
method

00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,790
so there are two parts to this the first

00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,640
one is you use the blend mode of

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,530
multiply or screen and then you isolate

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,950
the graphic with contrast filters and

00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:45,600
possibly the physical shape of it so as

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,770
an example here's a picture I took them

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
belong here from the rooftop of the

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,340
hotel last week super cool and I just

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,260
have a little hello waving back and

00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,430
forth but if we really dissect this

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,990
you'll see what's going on in the

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,910
background so let's make a little bit

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,590
bigger because I cut down the size five

00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,480
minutes to bake so 300 by maybe the

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,240
height of 400 and then you start to

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,490
think like what is that it's not fun

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,290
little hello that I thought it was let's

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:11,010
get rid of that multiply blend mode okay

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:13,020
let's get rid of the WebKit filter we

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,610
can give her the positioning so if you

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,470
take a look it's me holding up a random

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,570
coaster at a bar that I took a picture

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,400
of and I overlaid it on top of a graphic

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,990
and you can't tell it all with that lazy

00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,750
designer Messick's and using blend modes

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:29,210
and filters it's pretty cool another

00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,210
example of this thank you

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:36,680
being lazy here's another example of

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,510
this but I use the screen blend mode so

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,450
I took this random little sketch I could

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,070
just reload the browser thing um and

00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,250
here's me I'm doing that it's a sketch

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,990
for my sketchbook I am using these same

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,880
technique but with screen and just comes

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:53,960
in elements in the page and allows for a

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,820
really nice flow awesome websites that

00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,290
use blend modes for instance front and

00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,050
London they have this really nice

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,790
gradient of hot pink to red on this page

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,350
and you can even use it for um

00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,940
performance optimization because you can

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,800
use just a grayscale image that

00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,270
background for the JPEG decrease the

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,510
color size decrease the image size and

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:13,610
use blend modes to like make this

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,830
dynamic and really interesting

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,550
composition regardless of the images

00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,520
that you have in there

00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,830
another example is polygons they have a

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,450
really unique look on their homepage for

00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,310
this news story it's not something that

00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,860
you see often these days but it's really

00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,870
nice aesthetic to see and then the xoxo

00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,760
conference uses blend modes and my

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,620
favorite part blend modes is you can

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,270
scroll around you can animate them you

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,800
can really make this dynamic and

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,200
exciting for your user it's such a

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,690
little thing that allows for a much more

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,090
unique aesthetic let's go back in time

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,920
for a little bit back to the days of

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:51,560
deviantART does anyone here do

00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:53,210
deviantART yeah awesome so back in the

00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:57,230
day I remember I would go on and I would

00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:58,970
look for Photoshop actions and here was

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,530
like this description I don't don't read

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,480
that it's way too much text please don't

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,000
read it so anyway I wanted to start week

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,530
Rainey's Photoshop actions so um I found

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,840
one that sounded interesting

00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,490
raging mists offers the most faded

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,530
outlook of all of these it fades out

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:15,530
images with purple hues and warmer tones

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:19,160
to create a sultry vintage effect sound

00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:20,930
sultry let's do it all right so let's

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,370
recreate raging this filter that's the

00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,620
raging mist filter and that's our

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,030
original image so let's start the first

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,850
thing that we can do is use some filters

00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,860
so WebKit filter like I'm using a sepia

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,330
because I see some more warm tones I'm

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,040
going to do a hue rotate to start

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,200
getting it there maybe increase the

00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,330
saturation okay so that's great that's

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,370
on the image itself that's step one step

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,330
two is adding a layer on top so I'm

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,230
going to show you the have a layer on

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,670
top of here with a background color

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,800
I'll start with red so you could see it

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,160
okay so I didn't lie there's something

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,680
up there

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,460
and so now I want to do a mix blend mode

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:56,710
of maybe like multiply so it's laying on

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,710
top of that image but that's not exactly

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,660
the color that we want as a know so what

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,880
you can do is open your dev tools and

00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,860
use it like a browser pretty much like

00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,840
Photoshop you can use a really nice

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,570
color selector here you can change the

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,930
the Alpha Channel and you can even

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,490
select from the page to start getting

00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,840
that aesthetic that we want like I can

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,850
just keep clicking around maybe if I

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,920
don't like that color I could edit it a

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,110
little bit but it's starting to really

00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,660
look like the image that we want to get

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,910
for the final so that's good and there's

00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,610
only one step left if we really look at

00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,130
this raging mist example here I have to

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,110
remove it more you'll notice that in the

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,850
darkest parts we're losing some detail

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,980
in the shadow there's sort of this wash

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,480
over it it's like a washout effect it's

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,110
like this vintage it's a little bit

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,970
purpley gray effect there so let's make

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,190
that happen this is what I like to call

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,350
the washout effect method got some nice

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,270
methods for you the first step is to use

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,440
the blend mode of lighten and after

00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,420
we've done that we want to use a

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,760
background color of the shadow colors

00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,670
the darkest color that we want to appear

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,530
on our image so here's an example of

00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,920
doing that so to set the background mode

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:08,470
to lighten and then I am choosing this

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,780
secondary background so those are just

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,550
two backgrounds comma separated values

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,470
and as I go lighter the background

00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:17,080
becomes lighter and then I can choose

00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,060
that darkest color that I want to appear

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,220
on the page every other color will get

00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:26,050
washed out so let's do that so all right

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,490
I have my first background here let's

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,590
make other backgrounds of red for

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:33,670
instance and like I said we're going to

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:36,070
do a background blood mode of lighten

00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,270
okay so that's not exactly the shade

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,430
that we want it's washing out a little

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,140
too much so again I'm going to inspect

00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,440
element I'm going to find this image

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,520
find that red and sort of just set it to

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:50,620
like a deeper hue maybe like a purpley

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,810
washout tone I think that looks pretty

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,210
close so I'm going to keep that I have

00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,390
this value here and yeah that looks

00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,650
pretty good

00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,650
for the region that's filtered

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,720
not bad it could be worse but it could

00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,530
be better so let's kick it up a notch

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,030
the CSS gradients okay so I'm going to

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,680
go through this really quickly based

00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,870
gradients you just can do a linear

00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,390
gradient set to colors it starts at the

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:25,120
50% mark so I'm using this pink color

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:28,000
see 69 which is the sass color so I like

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,710
to use that for everything and then the

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,420
second goal area is like this blue shade

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,190
so it's basic gradient you can change

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,680
the directions I could do two right I

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,810
could do like two left to top to bottom

00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,640
whatever I can change those directions I

00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,230
can do degrees so here I've negative

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,350
twenty degrees I could do like 120

00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,270
degrees it changes the direction of that

00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,160
gradients you can also open the dev

00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,270
tools here and watch it spin which is

00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,250
really fun because you can just hit

00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,830
shift and arrow key and it'll like spin

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:58,300
for you so that's something that I have

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:59,440
no life alright so the next thing that I

00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,990
want talk about is the gradient stops

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,960
these are fun a cool thing is like the

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,580
further you go towards these stops you

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,100
can actually make like stripes so if I

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,750
keep going I set these both to 30 like

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,850
that makes a solid line because it's

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,310
fewer and fewer pixels for a gradient to

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,110
occur on and then what you can do is you

00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,430
can make like repeating gradients so you

00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,110
could make stripes across your page

00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:23,230
these are really fun for backgrounds and

00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:26,110
other such things we have the radial

00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:28,270
gradients so this takes the shape of the

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,030
element that it's contained within but

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,640
you can also set the shape of that

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:36,100
radial so I can make it a circle I can

00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,760
say like I want it to be like a 200 by

00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,830
30 pixel weird shape and you have a lot

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,690
of control with this as well and there's

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:48,430
also stripes the good news I could do a

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:50,140
repeating radial gradient so if I wanted

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,720
those solid stripes what I could do is

00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,880
set like the start color so start C 69

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,500
I'm going to end let's make this pixel

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,510
so it's easier to see ten pixels the

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,090
next color starting at ten pixels and

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,700
then I'm going to have it ending at that

00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,730
same color maybe I want this 30 pixels

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:09,820
wide so now I have this crazy gradients

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,230
to circle so it's not so crazy but yeah

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:14,920
you could just do radial stripes and

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:16,240
play around CSS is so much fun I'm so

00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:22,660
sorry

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:24,250
so sorry so conic gradients are really

00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,320
cool I think Lea's go talking about them

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,030
later go check that out or just stay in

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,550
this room listen to our talk I cannot

00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,590
wait to watch this so that's the thing

00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,990
to look forward to later all right

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,700
so this is an example of just using

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,340
those blend modes with the gradient so

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,720
here just basic image here is the just

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,330
the gradient I'm applying to it and it

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,300
creates all of these image variations

00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,650
I'm just so many different aesthetics by

00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,180
playing around and they all look pretty

00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:54,240
good I could have probably chosen any of

00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:56,440
these but wait there's more double fam

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,590
all right I'm going to take you back in

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,240
the day again to the days of these um

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,310
free blurry backgrounds so blurry

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,130
backgrounds are really cool right we all

00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:07,840
kind of use them we can break that down

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:09,610
and make them ourselves

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,290
you know why open Photoshop and make one

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,060
when we can make these with gradients so

00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:15,490
you can break it down and look at that

00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,470
one it has this magenta to royal blue

00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,390
color there's like this purple spot the

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,600
bottom there's a sweet spot the top

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:24,370
maybe some angled gradients of this like

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,870
tomato and light blue color this is why

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,340
I'm really good a named CSS colors I

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,070
don't know it's not a good thing fine

00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,810
okay so let's zoom in and make this

00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,940
thing happen all right so there's the

00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,900
final product that we're going for

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,120
here's our background what's going to

00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:41,110
happen I think a good place to start is

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:45,760
with this linear gradient that goes from

00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:47,350
like a hot pink to blue okay so there's

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,030
that but we don't want to go from top to

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,280
bottom we want to go to right so let's

00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,410
make it go to right maybe this is more

00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,310
like a deep pink I don't like I said I

00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,980
don't know why I know all these color

00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:58,750
names it's fine okay so that's a good

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,150
place to start I think the next best

00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,190
thing is to make that light spot the top

00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:07,090
so it's like this creamy color so we'll

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:11,700
do a radial gradient at the top and

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,700
it'll be from like wheat to transparent

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,750
we want a comma okay so that's that's

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,250
cool and we want to be at top so I can

00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,050
say where I want you positioned at and

00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,120
maybe I want this to be a circle at the

00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,490
top or maybe I want to specify the shape

00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,140
of it I think the circle is okay for now

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,640
and I wanted to be a little bit offset

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,710
in the page so I could be like negative

00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,289
10% is the start of that and I

00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,809
want to end at like 80% okay so we're

00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:37,590
starting to sort of get there okay so

00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:40,210
next maybe beneath that we have this

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:42,309
this tomato color so we have a linear

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,679
gradient and I know that it's going to

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:46,659
be at a degree so maybe like 160 degrees

00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,179
and it could be tomato it's going to be

00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:51,100
transparent I'm going to add a comma all

00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:53,020
right so that's starting to look more

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,390
like what we have but to save you all

00:25:53,020 --> 00:26:00,210
this pressure watching me go through all

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,210
of it I've already done it look at that

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,659
so what's really exciting about this is

00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:12,669
it's super powerful for creating your

00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:15,039
own customized filters you can create

00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:17,259
anything when you use this technique and

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,820
I use it on this site I used a very

00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:20,620
similar one to the one I just showed you

00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,809
and it adds this really unified

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,820
aesthetic to this page so without them

00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:26,080
these images are kind of boring and they

00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,750
blend into the background doesn't look

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,789
that good but if I add a custom filter

00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,769
that I make out of these gradients it

00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:36,190
really brings them together and unifies

00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:38,110
them on the page so you can make

00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:41,019
Instagram filters very very quickly and

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:42,340
easily pretty pretty easily so here's a

00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:44,980
picture of the office area of my

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:48,340
apartment and I use this an example so

00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,110
like rays Aiden I just did these for fun

00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,909
Inc well the cool thing about that is I

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,100
don't even have to use another after

00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:55,750
element to add some kind of blend mode I

00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,179
just used WebKit filters for that one

00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,519
and then for Perpetua I didn't use any

00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:01,389
WebKit filters I just used a blend mode

00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,519
afterwards

00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:07,210
it's like this blue to gray blue degree

00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:10,450
and sort of fake so let's review because

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:13,899
we're at the end here CSS filters plus

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:18,279
CSS blend modes plus CSS gradients equal

00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:20,139
awesome and in conclusion CSS is awesome

00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,000
like you can't do this in Photoshop you

00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,370
can't have this hero chain animation in

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,490
a presentation and Photoshop very easily

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:29,379
I don't think don't tell me I'm wrong

00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,429
but this is just the beginning like this

00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:31,720
is really exciting like this Barbie

00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,970
alright now we're at this very basic

00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,470
Mario game but soon we're going to be at

00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,779
like Super Mario 3d World

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,100
you know when browser start to really

00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:42,370
implement these and make them work

00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:44,080
really well with our GPUs it's really

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,059
good to just start playing around now so

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,500
I say art the web if you make something

00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:49,240
cool this talk inspired you use the

00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,850
hashtag art the web start to use these

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,740
things in your own personal projects or

00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:55,929
in production I sort of played around

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,210
with it on this site that I made I do a

00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:01,360
little bit of traveling and I write

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,909
about it sometimes I call it bad poetry

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,129
of good memories and if you want to go

00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:07,720
to it it sort of was like a tester for

00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:09,370
some of the concepts I talked about in

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,639
this talk so I'm using some different

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:14,259
things like she sees shapes and I'm

00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:16,960
using some of the filters and blend

00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:19,269
modes looks way better on your browser

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,590
in chrome 44 I know I don't care it's

00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:22,260
fine

00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,150
fine just a Chester so don't be like I

00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,720
can't see this Nighy I know you can't

00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,870
see tonight

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,220
I know so thank you so much for having

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,220
me and thank you like

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,780
