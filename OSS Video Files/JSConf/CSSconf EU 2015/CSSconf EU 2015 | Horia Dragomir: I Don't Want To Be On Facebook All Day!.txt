Title: CSSconf EU 2015 | Horia Dragomir: I Don't Want To Be On Facebook All Day!
Publication date: 2015-09-26
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2015
Description: 
	Horiaâ€™s talk tells the story of building messenger.com. Horia will give us a glimpse into how CSS is used at Facebook, and how it worked both for and against the developers tasked with working on the first secondary domain: messenger.com. Contains cool CSS and a bit of React. Youâ€™ve been warned!

Horia is currently a UI Engineer at Facebook, and in the past has worked on everything from design to project management, in all sorts of organizations, from social gaming companies to investment banks.

hi and welcome back from lunch am I too

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:27,330
loud yes no alright so let's talk about

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:30,029
how we build messenger calm and if you

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,120
don't know messengers calm is a full

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:35,460
page react application on which you can

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,149
send and receive facebook messenger

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,590
messages um why would we build such a

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,989
thing when you already have chat on

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,250
facebook well when we launched it we

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,280
gave all the reasons in the press

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,980
release and they're so true something

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,780
nice happen is a side effect a lot of

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,570
corporations for instance block access

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,649
to facebook on their corporate networks

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,399
because they want people to be

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,500
productive but they don't block access

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,739
to messenger calm at least not yet so

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,680
there's that but also we thought it

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,979
would be very cool to build and how do I

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,140
get to work on it I was just lucky I i

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,009
joined facebook right about the time it

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,330
was started and the web messages team

00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:21,750
pitched the project i liked it and i

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,299
joined and I never looked back before we

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,130
get into actual messenger com I want to

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,860
take them over and talk about how we

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,570
front in that facebook and I think it's

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,140
time we use front-end as a verb it's

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:38,369
hard to talk otherwise but as most

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,200
companies do we use modules small

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,630
components this is the thing that makes

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,750
sense everyone knows everyone agrees I

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,790
think how we make modules is the same as

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,460
everyone else we will define one just

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,040
messenger foo it lives in the file that

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,350
has the same name messenger foo we just

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,549
add this doc block to the beginning of

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,380
the CSS file and ready to get started we

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,320
had our rules but we have a special kind

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,149
of syntax as you can see we use the name

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,819
of the module and a slash and then the

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,220
actual rule name this makes it very easy

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,470
to whenever you look at the class name

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,730
to know what it belongs to

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,860
and we have it so that you can only use

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,600
rules and class names that belong to

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,510
this module over here so if we try to

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,250
use messenger bar this will be a lint

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,130
error why would you want to change

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,280
messenger bar rules from with a

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,660
messenger foo we do this for

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,350
encapsulation purposes and to try to

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,150
make our CSS components small and very

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,850
focus on one thing so we can compose

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,230
multiple if we need to however sometimes

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,640
you do need to style something from

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,670
another component so we have a thing

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,620
called public classes we just define

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,450
them in a way that you can use in a

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,770
different module because sometimes you

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,260
do need to style things differently

00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,840
depending on how you can post things but

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,550
this will really make a lot of sense why

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,150
would we always overwrite the public

00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:05,310
class of another module we just

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,470
concatenate with our rule it's very

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,540
simple it just takes some getting used

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,730
to especially with a slash in the rule

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,010
name which is not valid syntax I don't

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,200
think well you don't even need to use

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,300
all that a simple rule like that is all

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,830
you need for a mile to exist we don't

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,269
even need a rule you just need to put

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,180
the module there and everything will be

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,640
public and it is how we would use it in

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,640
JavaScript we have a simple mark

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,290
messenger foo react component we have an

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,220
h1 and we want to just use the title

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:37,680
class name on it we just right you know

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,630
react does anyone here use react I'm

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,519
sure you do yes there we go put your

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:46,320
hands down but we can do more complex

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,780
things instead of saying just use this

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,660
class name we can pass it some JSON and

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,459
this in this JSON the property names are

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,280
the actual class names that we want to

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,290
use and the values are booleans and the

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,799
signal whether or not to include this

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:04,470
class in the class list and let's focus

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:10,380
on the the weird thing over there that's

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:12,780
CX CX is our class transform function it

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,790
serves multiple purposes for one thing

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,830
it actually evaluates the logic of which

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,310
classes to include based on the boolean

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:23,640
values for jasons but it's always there

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,780
we always have to use it so we know that

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,810
we can search for it

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,060
and we look for instances of CX and we

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,950
find out which modules do we need to

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,740
include in this case we need to include

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:38,620
messenger foo and messenger bar that CSS

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,700
these two modules and we do this not at

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,950
runtime because that will be very

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,700
inefficient we do this through static

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,320
analysis at build time we just parts all

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,600
our JavaScript files and we see which

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,340
modules are being referenced and then

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,800
whenever the module will be loaded we

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,260
already have the CSS loaded side by side

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,780
with it it's on a package and all

00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,530
required and this is great because you

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,840
never forget to include your modules and

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:08,110
it saves you love you know time hassled

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,169
debugging effort and this enables us to

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,630
do very cool things that have to do with

00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:16,120
the two modes and now I'm not talking

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,970
about you read software more than you

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,470
write software even when you're writing

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,990
software or when you're reading software

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,630
a code or when you're debugging it

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,130
you're still in the human mode it's you

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,740
interacting with the code that you or

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,500
somebody else is written the other mode

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,660
is the Machine mode is the machine when

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,490
it executes your code and it has to do

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:41,380
something with has to understand it our

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,240
our static strength our static tools our

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,560
psyche transforms and analysis allow us

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,350
to do things there are good both for

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,539
humans and for machines for instance

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:52,150
this is all we need to type to get all

00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:55,000
the prefixes these get added at build

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,460
time automatically this is an

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,350
optimization done for humans it's very

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,240
unpleasant to have to type these manuals

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,460
I'm sure you know and you'll use prefix

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,960
free or something of the sort we go a

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,150
step further we also optimized for

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,169
machine at this level as well more or

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:13,750
less when a person loads our page they

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:17,110
load it with a browser so if I'm using

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,630
Firefox and I load messenger com why

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,370
would I get the MS transform and the

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,840
WebKit transform declarations they make

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,180
no sense the browser will ignore them

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,940
they're wasted bites we actually don't

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,440
even send them we look at what browser

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,660
you're using and we only send you the

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,310
rules that you will understand which is

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,450
very cool because this saves a lot of

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,320
bites and bites save energy in fact I

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,210
estimated just by this thing

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,430
we save enough energy which is

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,620
equivalent to about half a Hiroshima

00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:49,700
every day to put it in a different

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,430
perspective it's enough energy to warm

00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,800
up this room to a temperature of 214

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:59,210
cats for about a week that's a lot

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,180
another thing we do and this is actually

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:06,500
a pet peeve of mine it doesn't matter if

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,720
an element is 0 pixels or 0% or zero

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,790
elephants from the right it's smack on

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,250
the right we don't need the unit there

00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,310
we actually do remove it the static

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:19,700
analysis and this again saves bytes

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,430
white save energy this simple say by

00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,170
removing the unit from zero allows 200

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:28,730
stray cats to find a new home every

00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:31,330
single day that's my estimation and this

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:34,220
managing is something we do for machines

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,190
because I am a human I'm sure your human

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:40,100
as well most of you and we need

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,470
something like this we need a rule that

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,480
makes sense when you read it this is the

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,170
title rule belonging to the messenger

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:51,770
for component a machine doesn't care a

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:54,160
machine needs a unique string so why not

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,900
make it something very very short a

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,580
machine will do just fine and we never

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,890
have to read this this just happens

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:05,540
between machines so back to our

00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:08,150
JavaScript example this whole thing gets

00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,990
evaluated and say we also have the

00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,430
subtitle it will be those two classes

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,190
but this is after build time when this

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,780
actually runs so it's not that big long

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,660
string in the class this is just

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,410
something small like this now the

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:27,410
compound savings from all these bites

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:29,810
arteries are enough to boil all the

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,120
coffee that has and ever will be

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:35,810
consumed that all the CSS cons would

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,550
ever ever happen but we're not over I

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:40,700
mean this is just writing and maybe

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,650
debugging a but yes we're shipping code

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,880
we're shipping our code to the the users

00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,610
and they're loading in their browsers

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,560
but we're not done we have another thing

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,970
it's called machine learning which we

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,490
can use we have this cool thing called

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,030
packager and remember how we reference

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,060
to

00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:58,730
ss modules in our example messenger foo

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,380
and messenger bar well packager we'll

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,840
look at how messenger full and messenger

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,750
bar are loaded especially in relation to

00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,310
messenger food out Jas and we'll see

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,500
that whenever we request messenger foo

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,540
we also request messenger bar so it

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,690
makes sense to turn these two files into

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,150
one single file and the file name will

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,460
also be very small again fewer bytes and

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:24,130
fewer bytes and this is these are just

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:28,220
randomly generated hashes but even even

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:31,610
machines can make mistakes two weeks ago

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:35,780
or so this file was generated based on

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:38,810
packagers heuristics and I'm sure some

00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:42,170
of you already see the problem some

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:44,540
people couldn't chat for a considerable

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,490
amount of time because ad blockers

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,140
thought this was an ad when in fact it

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:52,040
was just a couple of our modules that we

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:56,480
kind of need for chats work machines are

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,370
silly but that's why we're here and here

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,440
today yesterday and just in general

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,850
people ask me a lot whether we use less

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,520
or SAS and which one would prefer at

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:08,390
Facebook or do we use tieless we use

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,610
nothing because using one of these make

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,830
it harder for people who just start to

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,020
get into the groove anyone who's ever

00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:18,110
written a web page can work at Facebook

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,640
and they instantly know everything they

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:23,510
do need to know to be able to be

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,550
efficient we use plain old CSS however

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,100
we do have the static analysis and style

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,720
transform step in our build system so we

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,850
can do some funny things we use

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,170
variables of course we call him

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,110
constants though because they're not

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:41,390
really variable and this is how you use

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:42,920
a constant what it's a bar but anyway it

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,530
builds stuff we will replace it with his

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,680
actual value this is great so you don't

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,990
have to always remember you know fo six

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,080
for a magenta you can just say messenger

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:57,350
magenta and that will be great now the

00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,500
rule that you have to use to you know to

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:03,140
go from a actual explicit hex value to a

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,470
constant or after how many repetitions

00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,970
do you use that the rule

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,190
I still don't know it but I'll find out

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,710
and I'll tell you but that's enough

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:15,530
about how we we actually you know ship

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:18,290
code I think you got a pretty okay idea

00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:20,690
of what happens hopefully otherwise

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,420
let's talk later but let's get back to

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,700
messenger calm because it all actually

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,430
started a long time ago when we rewrote

00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,650
chat the facebook chat with this in a

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,230
very special way we thought let's make

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,880
some components that have no styling

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,980
they just get the data they need and

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,800
then we have different components that

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,410
will present the data this is not a new

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,050
concept but we decided to apply this

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,060
religiously through chat we call these

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,490
Stalag gnostic components containers and

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,580
everything is a container and needs a

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,560
presenter to actually display the data

00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,150
so you wrap a you know a normal

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,980
presenter in a container and you wrap

00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,390
that you know what multiple lists of

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,180
them in another container and so on you

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,920
go up and go up we call this shawarma

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,850
driven development because everything is

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,890
a rap as a simple example let's say we

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,960
would hypothetically have a list of

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:15,920
recent conversations that we'll just

00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:18,140
call the style agnostic threadless we

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,060
give us some parameters we give it a

00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,860
presenter which is something again we

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,440
control and we give it a class name just

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,720
so we have a hook so we can use its

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,450
public classes to style things and we're

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,940
done it goes down one level it calls the

00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,130
class the component we pass in and then

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,400
again we for every conversation we just

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,890
add a new container pass down to how the

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,600
classes have the hooks and so on until

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:45,860
we have the whole tree shawarma and

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,080
because this was a new thing right this

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,450
is facebook com and facebook com has

00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,010
been there for a while we believe that

00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,930
everybody should be able to use facebook

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,590
so we support a large amount of browsers

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:59,150
but messenger come was a new thing and

00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,710
by definition it is niche it's people

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,780
who really want to use messenger and

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,550
they want to have a nice environment to

00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,730
do so and Icefall this type of

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,380
environment so we decided to not support

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,720
the old browsers and that meant we could

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,210
use the new CSS stuff we were finally

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,970
free to use flex box and suffolk CSS

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,880
grid for layout and whatnot except we

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,070
weren't because we want to

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,940
have something that looks like this and

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:28,850
with a CSS only solution it didn't work

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:32,030
out that well as Leah mentioned in her

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:34,220
talk just having the CSS only solution

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,780
doesn't help you is just so you can say

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,910
that you have it but it doesn't do

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,310
anything else than be and sometimes it's

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,410
wrong as well so instead of using

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,720
flexbox and CSS to it we went back to

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,660
using an old component of ours it's a

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,020
layout component and it is JavaScript

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:53,300
based but it's battle-tested we've been

00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,980
using this for a long time we figured

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:59,120
out the bugs people who are much smarter

00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,400
than me fix the bugs and we ship with

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,680
this and later after it was ship when we

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,080
had more time we went back and found out

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,510
what was wrong with flexbox it turns out

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,980
that because flexbox has changed so much

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,510
over time it's you know its

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,830
specification and all that and the

00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:17,150
standard it still isn't we had some

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,270
static transform tools that were

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,680
conflicting with each other and chrome

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,290
would sometimes get the new version of

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,730
flexbox automatically transform but for

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,190
Safari you would get the old version

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,020
with the WebKit box and of course that

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,410
wouldn't work well what once you figure

00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:35,540
out those issues it was okay except for

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,460
you know Internet Explorer because

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,420
engine explore is to need to specify ms

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,920
flex in a 1 10 pixels and it needs to

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,630
have pixels there because if you just

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,310
say 0 it doesn't know that it doesn't

00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,250
know what you mean I remember our rule

00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:50,660
that strips away the unit from pixels so

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,650
we just added a couple of exceptions and

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,550
we were fine to go with flexbox flexbox

00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:59,120
well we weren't out of the woods yet

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,250
because it's a bit product even though

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,830
it's it sounds simple it actually has

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:07,280
very many moving parts the shawarma wrap

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:10,250
is very deep and I'm sure you can see

00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,820
the problem with this and if you miss it

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:17,710
let me blow it up for you as you're

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,930
typing in a right-to-left language and

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:24,490
you type in comma space as you do to add

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,860
a comma the college's jumps

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,360
this is weird we never understood why

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,580
and we spend a lot of time just

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,450
debugging why this happened we thought

00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,920
were supposed to some old archaic

00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:40,330
components that we weren't including by

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,279
mistake but it turned out that it was

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,230
our over optimization as many websites

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,330
as many web applications we have just

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,589
one font definition it's a font family

00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,670
we have a fun stack and everything's

00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:52,810
fine we were using helvetica neue

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,190
Helvetica neue actually has this problem

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,080
that if you're typing in right to left

00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,080
and you've having a character character

00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,209
character comma space character space

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,520
and comma will just invert and that

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:06,190
looks very horrible if you're a user

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,760
that you know speaks in a right-to-left

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:12,610
written language so instead of using her

00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,080
veticon know which is the cool thing we

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,490
detected if you're using right to left

00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,529
we don't want you to have a better

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:21,580
experience so we just fall back to REO

00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:23,890
REO the old boring REO but the old

00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,570
boring battle-tested area which has been

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:29,200
improved over time and works well with

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:30,339
anything you throw at it and this was

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,640
just something that we just happen to

00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,839
find out Helvetica neue has this problem

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:39,940
but there are some things within

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:42,399
facebook that got in our way java

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,940
subcomponents really like pixels as size

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,959
dimensions as they should but remember

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:51,100
we're a full page application pixels

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,620
don't work well because you resize the

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,380
page a lot you might want to dock it to

00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,899
the lift and not only that but we need

00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,279
to accurately display what you have sent

00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:02,770
to the other person with which you're

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:04,809
talking if you send them an image we

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:08,350
need to display like this or if you send

00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:11,740
more images each case has a different

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:14,740
grid on different sizing and we need to

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,150
kind of make it look nice and if we try

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,890
to stretch images they will look

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,650
horrible and we needed a different

00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:24,189
approach also they're always about

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:27,250
roughly half of the other conversation

00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:29,740
window even if they're six or just one

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,970
in short we needed to be responsive and

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:35,860
that's very hard to do if you're using

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:38,880
pixels so we had to add our own

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,800
containers again just so we could

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,140
use different CSS classes that were

00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,060
based on percentages and we couldn't use

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,560
a lot of the building blocks that people

00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,950
on facebook com use out of the box

00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,710
because they only work with pixels still

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,390
though we have four break points oh

00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:58,660
that's not a lot but it's kind of a lot

00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:01,180
because it's four and we change small

00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,730
things that every one of them the bigger

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:06,340
thing that you'll notice is the right

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,840
hand side information panel if we detect

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,730
that we don't that you don't have enough

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,260
space to comfortably displayed and also

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,610
view the conversation will just

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,380
automatically close it for you you can

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,990
still open it if you want we have the

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,030
button and again if as you expand and

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,240
you have more space we automatically

00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,590
open it for you actually the day we

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,600
released we got featured on good

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:28,480
products as you do and a person

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,410
literally spent enough time resizing is

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,750
browser window back-engineering how we

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,060
what the rules for this are and he was

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,650
so impressed that we took the time to do

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:41,530
this but this is actually something very

00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,300
simple it makes a big difference but

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,160
it's something simple you can do but if

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,240
something is very in your face you can

00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,920
also be responsive at a smaller scale

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,890
titles and messenger even on your phone

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,510
app are there centered so we Center the

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,220
page title which is messenger but we

00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,340
also Center the conversation title in

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:03,480
this case it's an unnamed group between

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,740
me and two other people with long names

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:10,060
what if you want to dock your window to

00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:11,950
the left of your screen truncating

00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,600
centered text is weird especially if you

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,550
have icons on the other side because

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,800
they will take up space on evenly and

00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:20,440
we'll just look weird and you can't do

00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,150
it you can't use a CSS only solution for

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,770
this because it's not dependent on the

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,530
size of the viewport is depend on the

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,880
size of the name and the element that

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,580
contains in the name and not even

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,560
element query if we ever get it will

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,940
help us here for this you need of a

00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,310
hybrid solution you need to measure the

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,900
size of the text and measure the size of

00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,000
the container and when there's not

00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,010
enough room just change a class named

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,250
float everything to the left and apply a

00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:47,740
truncation if you need to now we do a

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,360
lot of these small things on break

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,060
points or when we detect that you don't

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,250
have enough space just so everything

00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,110
nicely and looks nicely it's supposed to

00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,660
be an app that's on par with the native

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,540
experience and that means you need to do

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:04,720
a lot of these little polishing and

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:07,450
speaking of polishing and how we know

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,330
titles messenger are centered that's an

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:14,980
interface guide and we have an interface

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:17,200
guy for facebook now please please tell

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,350
me you know what this is just say what

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,020
it is yes it's a fig right the Facebook

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,840
interface guy to fig I showed this to

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:30,100
Americans and they just had no idea what

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,900
it was they had not seen figs I went hot

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,030
air ballooning and the person though the

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,670
pilot dropped the balloon so we could

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:39,010
just brush against some walnut trees you

00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,180
know walnuts and he said you know if you

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,770
reach how you can actually grab some

00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,320
walnut so I did and I grabbed the walnut

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,240
and was all still green and only me and

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,010
the pilot knew that that's what walnuts

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,570
looked like Americans are weird they

00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,070
don't know what fruit looks like in any

00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,660
case that's the fig that's the facebook

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,760
in your face guide and we have a

00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,520
different product it's a messenger thing

00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:01,570
so you get the reference i'm trying to

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:05,350
make we have the mig the messenger

00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:07,240
interface guide and that's just a visual

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,250
style guide of how things should look

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,370
like a different combinations and all

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,840
that normally it's made by a designer we

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,240
found that it's a lot better to be made

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,740
by people who are working on the product

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,540
not just the design is not just the

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,940
developers with everybody involved

00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,290
because some things make sense the

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,060
designers somethings are very cool to

00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,590
design two designers but don't make

00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,290
sense to implement or just don't make

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,560
sense for people to use in any case we

00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,700
took some of the facebook components and

00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,830
turn them into our own components

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:40,120
remember how when Chad was rewritten

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,370
everything was a container and a

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,820
presenter that's kind of how we do

00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,410
components everywhere we have an

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,170
abstract thing and something that gives

00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:51,760
a presentation and we were able to take

00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,070
the Facebook button turn into a

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,160
messenger button which looks a lot like

00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,200
a button I know I'm sorry but you can

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,270
see you know facebook facebook on the

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,190
left messenger on the right even though

00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,380
it's the same component underneath and

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,010
that's great because the facebook

00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,480
components

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,340
have undergone a lot of work to make

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,820
them accessible you have we have a lot

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,200
of customization for Aria roles and for

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,060
screen readers to be able to properly

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,280
detect them and their states and we

00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,590
wanted to get all that good stuff over

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:24,310
the messenger I want to take just a

00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:26,380
short time to emphasize accessibility we

00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,960
need more of this doesn't matter if it

00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,190
looks good if you can't see it you need

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,380
to be able to use something and another

00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:38,230
thing that's bad also focus ability but

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:41,500
just bad as an element is my new

00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:45,970
favorite element the hate lets the image

00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:47,860
tag let's go back to this example the

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:51,400
images here are you know the basically

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,870
shawarmas but they're each a different

00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,910
image but we need to display them in a

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,530
nice grid if we would have a jagged

00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,060
thing it would be horrible if we display

00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,530
them one by one it would take up too

00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:03,070
much space and use your contacts of your

00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:05,020
conversation so we need to you know

00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,570
sighs them evenly which is not always

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,790
possible with image tags if you also

00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:13,420
want to make the images look nice and

00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,560
then we have other use cases where with

00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,200
your share a link will show you a

00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,280
preview of what that link is and

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,040
sometimes the link will have a thumbnail

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:25,570
in this case yes hot-plug that's me I'm

00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:28,420
sexy but I have a square image as my

00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:31,780
profile although over here is displayed

00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,430
in this nice wide ratio that we decided

00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,310
would look best for all images there are

00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,630
big enough to be displayed like this but

00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,340
it's a square image being displayed as

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,470
wide but what happens if you don't have

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,230
a big enough image well we fall back to

00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:46,360
a different more in line version we just

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,730
use the icon and we stretch it in a

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:52,480
different way you can't do this with

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:54,730
images and live a sane life so we just

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,400
obviously use background size we still

00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,200
have invisible images on top so you can

00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,820
still drag and drop things and we still

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,830
have links around them so you can open a

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,940
new tab right there so the accessibility

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,140
there is still there but the

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,810
presentation there well it looks like

00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,450
the people who can see it's a lot nicer

00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:12,520
and it's also something we control and

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,920
that is MIG compliant the messager

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,960
interface guide and we do everything we

00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,190
can CSS to make sure to set it up and

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,500
then we close the deal in Chavez

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,450
some things you can't do in CSS like

00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,880
this especially if you have a lot of

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,550
dynamic data and because we have these

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,880
polite little building blocks we can do

00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:33,830
cool things I have interactive maps that

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,180
respect are an interface guide and

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,550
respect the Facebook interface guide on

00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,050
facebook look at the look at the corners

00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,610
they're all nice and rounded therefore

00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,490
when the corners meet up there in the

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,960
top this is also partly interface guide

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,460
but you get this for free if you just

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,290
use our components because they're all

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,590
very small and all do just one little

00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:53,740
thing you can have simple attachments

00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:57,020
that just say hey here's my opinion or

00:24:53,740 --> 00:25:00,920
you can have nice stunning-looking

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:03,080
images that retailers would like you to

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,180
still experience after you've left their

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,190
shop and you get notifications yes you

00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:10,400
know you bought this belt is on its way

00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,860
great and people who have built these

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,150
things that aren't on our team tell us

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,650
that they really enjoy building stuff

00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,690
from messenger calm because of how easy

00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,840
it is just use the small components that

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:24,230
we've built and the CSS is very small

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,970
but does its job very well but that's

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:29,210
not the best thing the best thing that

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:32,030
we've we feel that we've done is we were

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,220
the first secondary domain everything

00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,800
you saw is basically Facebook code

00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,660
running on a domain that is in facebook

00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,480
and they'll never be able to take that

00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,790
away from us so do try messenger calm

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:49,900
and let us know what you think we'll be

00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:49,900
