Title: CSSconf EU 2015 | Katie Kurkoski: Developing for Localization
Publication date: 2015-09-26
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2015
Description: 
	As a developer for Getty Images whose site is localized into more than 20 languages, Katie is all too familiar with the layout havoc caused by translated content. In her talk, "Developing for Localization:  CSS Techniques To Get Your Message Across To The World Wide Web", she will demonstrate CSS techniques to get your message across the world wide web. From easy wins such as non-embedded image copy to sneaky replacements for padding and margin to buff up those grids, you'll learn robust techniques for your day-to-day CSS development.

Katie is a front end developer for Getty Images in Seattle, USA and a curator of Cascadia Fest, a local JavaScript and CSS conference. She is a veteran of the days of table-based layouts and JavaScript debugging using alerts. She also fiddles with Nodebots, volunteers for GDI Seattle, makes glass art, or plays with dice and super heroes.

great I'm so excited to be here thank

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:26,189
you everybody so Nick talked a little

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,920
bit about me i do want to point out that

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,539
the links to all of the demos that I'm

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,579
going to use and some extra rating if

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,710
you're interested is always down there

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,910
at the bottom of the screen it's going

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,890
to be at KDK to github I yo /

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,600
localization so you can go ahead and

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:49,320
take a look at the list of links anytime

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:53,520
if you want to um so this happens to me

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,640
in the US kind of a lot I finish a build

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,250
like this in the CSS I've perfectly

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,949
established a lovely vertical grid that

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,019
the designer wanted all the images align

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,939
all the headlines align all of the

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,510
call-to-action buttons align it's great

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:12,150
it's perfect time for a donut and then I

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,990
switch into German

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,420
and it's terrible the long headlines

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,300
broke the grid that we had the buttons

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,510
the buttons are terrible that's we can't

00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,580
have that it is not time for a donut

00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:29,430
this happens kind of a lot even worse

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,960
still in English when we let the content

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,970
owners go into the content management

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,630
system and they start changing the text

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:40,350
they move my buttons around again

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:42,510
honestly stop hit so probably this build

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,530
was not so perfect after all and we're

00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:48,660
going to have to take care of it ah

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,210
Getty Images we localize our site into

00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,790
over 20 different language and

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,440
localization versions so I've kind of

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,910
learned quite a lot in the past couple

00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,350
years about how to build a site so that

00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:02,160
it's going to work with a ton of

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,200
different text around it let me stop for

00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,650
a minute just to talk about what exactly

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,530
is localization when pics are released

00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:14,010
their Japanese dubbed version of inside

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,810
out they changed the green peppers from

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,570
the original broccoli from the original

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,360
version into green peppers because in

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:24,560
Japan green peppers are the universally

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,810
reviled vegetable for children

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,150
localization can include emotional and

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,260
cultural changes like this as well as

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,970
just switching the language over

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,560
localization can also include all of the

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,380
different changes that you have to have

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,470
four units of measurement and even the

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,930
way that very large numbers are

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,640
formatted and today what I'm going to be

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,470
talking about is not the entire

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,540
localization stack that's a bigger

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,610
problem than I can solve in 30 minutes

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,060
but I'm going to talk about how to

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,330
handle all of those changes using CSS

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,580
the results of all of those changes and

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,590
and this isn't just for translated

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,209
content even if you're a small site who

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,090
doesn't have to worry about going into

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,400
multiple languages you probably have

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,010
content owners and a content management

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,260
system or perhaps you have

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,440
user-generated content or content coming

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,570
from a database and at the very least I

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,450
would urge you to consider respecting

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,380
the device font sizes when a user with

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,110
less than

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,790
our vision changes their font size to be

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,440
a little bit bigger so that your boxes

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:37,020
don't break when that happens okay cool

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,590
so let's first talk about images and

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,180
embedded text embedded in images don't

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,320
worry this is not going to be the last

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,940
kitten that I'm going to show you today

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:50,340
I know you're concerned what we want is

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,220
we want for the image to be the exact

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,410
same on every version of our site but we

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,260
want the text to change okay well that's

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,930
not too hard but um I don't really want

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,550
to host 20 different images with 20

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,940
different languages embedded in the text

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,590
do I worse whenever the text changes I

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,550
don't want to make 20 new images in

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,250
Photoshop yuck so instead we're going to

00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,910
use our modern CSS skills to let the

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,410
text be text and the image be an image

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,680
why do we care so much about letting the

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,060
text be text maybe we want a foreign

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,390
trained traveler to be able to buy a

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:30,390
train ticket that would be great maybe

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:35,670
for SEO that's kind of important i guess

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:40,230
uh uh yeah so text should just stay text

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:42,930
that would be better languages are often

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,960
much different sizes here we have German

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,010
it's three lines long German in Spanish

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,930
are usually much longer than English

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,970
Japanese and Hebrew for example I'm

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,170
often much shorter than English so we

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,840
have to worry about making sure that our

00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:02,610
box is going to be different sizes in

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,680
both directions okay cool let's start

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,480
with the markup and then some pretty

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,830
simple styles throughout i'm not going

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,050
to show you the reset so i assume you

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,570
all already know all about that in case

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,510
you haven't seen it before the figure is

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,340
a new element with html5 and it is

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,370
perfect for containing both an image

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,990
just an image tag and a caption which is

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,360
the text its associated with the image

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,460
such lovely because we can semantically

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,090
associate our image and its text

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,340
together double thumbs up yeah and then

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:35,040
we have some not too exciting styling

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,000
where we set some sizes and the color on

00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,000
our caption image

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,050
the first thing we're going to do is

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,300
we're going to want to position the

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,060
bottom of the fig caption element to the

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,880
bottom of the figure element okay we can

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,450
do that using position absolute right

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,980
bottom zero at close what's going to

00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,800
position it to the bottom of the

00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,300
containing of the the viewport the

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,230
browser window because it's positioned

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,230
absolutely for everything instead what

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,020
we also need to do is to capture the fig

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:13,680
captions position in context by adding

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:17,540
position relative on the parent figure

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,980
element itself thus we now have the

00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,510
caption at the bottom of the figure

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:26,340
element it's been captured so cool cool

00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,320
next let's take care of those let's take

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,890
care of those pink stripes on the side

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,820
that's pretty ugly the cool thing we can

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:37,410
do with this is we can use the CSS

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,780
intrinsic width module now this is

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:42,090
relatively new so do check the browser

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,130
support that you use earlier yoona

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,140
mentioned can i use calm and that's a

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,570
great way to see what supported you can

00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,310
also use the Mozilla developer network

00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,690
to get a good idea of whether the thing

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,840
that you need to use is supported for

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,720
your browser do we use a fallback in

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,450
this case i've used macs with 400 pixels

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,729
and then that's overrated overwritten by

00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,940
browsers that support it with Max with

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:09,990
Max content and what I've said it to be

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:14,250
is max content Nick told the choke using

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:15,930
yeah max content earlier what this means

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,600
is it's going to make the parent

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:21,450
elements maximum with only as wide as it

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:25,190
needs to be to contain all of its

00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:27,450
children so this is what gives us this

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,430
we don't have those pink stripes anymore

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,790
it's just contained by its content which

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:35,729
is pretty sweet the last thing that we

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,400
need to do is set a max height and a max

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:41,900
width on the image itself so that it can

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,570
be responsive inside its figure parent

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,010
and then we take a look at this in all

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,770
three different languages that we looked

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:53,789
at before we're like great that is

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,319
exact same CSS for every language and it

00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:57,360
doesn't break no matter which language

00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:02,639
were using it's awesome that's awesome

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:05,009
good cool there are also ways to use

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,220
different CSS for different languages

00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:11,220
and we can you've probably seen before

00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,310
how to specify the exactly perfect

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:17,550
typographic quotes for an element using

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,889
the quotes declaration inside q we can

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,860
just stick any Unicode this is the

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,330
Unicode for fancy-pants opening quote

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,000
Unicode for a fancy-pants closing

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,220
opening quote any Unicode in there will

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,199
work and that's great for default if the

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,760
majority of folks who visit your site

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,620
are using are going to be reading it in

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,209
english but in germany i'm told that we

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,250
use different quote marks those funny

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:45,649
little guys down at the bottom no

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:49,290
problem on the HTML we can set a

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:51,149
language attribute equal to d e and now

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,950
in normally you probably want to put the

00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:55,529
language attribute on your body element

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,230
but in this case just for demos you can

00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:00,480
stuff it on any old element you want

00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:04,500
then this is paired with the language

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,610
pseudo class in the CSS and different

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:14,070
unicode characters for the quote marks

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:16,079
awesome great same thing for japanese we

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,110
want to have different quote marks so we

00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:22,140
just match the Jaypee language attribute

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,320
for the quote element with a JP pseudo

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,029
class for the quote elements and you can

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,740
just paste the marks in there directly

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:33,180
if you don't want to track down their

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,980
unicode codes that works too i mentioned

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:39,120
before that this will work with any set

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:41,850
of unicode or any characters so what

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,279
I've done here is I've stolen the

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,140
language code for Esperanto to make an

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,230
emoji version of the quote that I was

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,329
using before the the values that are

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,570
legal inside these attributes come from

00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:56,730
the iso 639 language codes which you can

00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:00,120
google for there's really a lot and I

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:03,560
just stole Esperanto s which is e 0 NE 0

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,360
and so I've decided that for

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,910
oh gee we're going to open our quotes

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,040
with donut we're going to close it with

00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:19,790
coffee and that's what we see over here

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:23,839
donut and coffee so y'all have probably

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:25,430
seen text transform before and perhaps

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,560
you know that in the past there were

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:31,160
some problems with the implementations

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,560
of text transform in browsers the most

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,570
recent updates to the CSS to text

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,980
transform law module lay out some

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,110
additional rules which correct problems

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,960
from previous modules and that's pretty

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,870
awesome for example one of the problems

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,850
previously was that if using text

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,740
transform capitalize which is supposed

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,680
to capitalize every word in a character

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,140
that works pretty good but right in here

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,190
this idea graph for Dutch both

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,390
characters are supposed to be

00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,370
capitalized because they're kind of

00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,550
considered a d1 character and that's

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:05,650
fixed in the most current version of the

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:09,230
css3 module and most browsers support it

00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:11,570
chrome does super the most recent

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:15,140
version of Firefox also supports another

00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:18,500
fix one of the problems was that in

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,900
German the SS character when it's

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,339
capitalized is supposed to be 2 s's not

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,580
the shoes that you've probably seen

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:32,390
before well firefox fixes that swell

00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:35,600
great super but I Microsoft edge doesn't

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,160
quite do that we've still got shoes

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:43,370
hanging out there when it should be to

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:44,600
us as instead sadface so some of the

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,390
updates are available in a lot of

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,060
browsers but not all of them are and in

00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,190
fact I would encourage you to be really

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:56,180
really cautious with any use of text

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:59,300
transform period because for me it's

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:03,470
trey is really really close to the idea

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:06,430
of using CSS which is for styling to

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:09,170
change the content of a language for

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,180
example you probably saw the Wi-Fi

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,610
password was in all caps because it

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,900
looked lovely on the slideshow but when

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,279
you type the Wi-Fi password and it's

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,759
supposed to be lowercase

00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,829
so probably just let the content owners

00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,139
the text writers write what they mean

00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:26,600
instead of forcing style changes upon

00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:28,939
them in the CSS probably stay away from

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,249
that but if you're thinking about using

00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:33,019
text transform if you must check the

00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:34,819
specs because it sort of kind of works

00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:41,029
better than it used to and that's what

00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:43,339
we can expect now let's take a look at

00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:45,860
headlines which are a fairly common

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:48,740
element that you'll see in a lot of

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,199
designs in fact this is a fairly common

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,420
design that I get from my designer where

00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:55,670
they want the headline to be scooched in

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,499
a little bit from the containing box for

00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,360
emphasis because the headline is

00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:01,009
obviously looking much more interesting

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,809
if it's scooched in from the rest of the

00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:05,360
text and it's got a centered

00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:06,589
call-to-action button cool pretty

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,360
standard this should not be hard at all

00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:13,430
you would not believe how many slides i

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,290
actually have on this head ok well the

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,639
market is pretty simple we're just going

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,379
to start with a section that will give

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,939
us a place to throw our gradient on and

00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:22,069
the section is going to contain a

00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:24,170
headline we're going to put a line break

00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:26,389
in the headline and we're going to have

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,720
an anchor to be our call to action

00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:31,910
button so that's pretty cool yeah we're

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,519
going to affect that big fat Martin

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:37,309
margin just by stuffing it on the

00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:41,569
section element so we've given a side

00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:43,459
padding of uh we've given a top padding

00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:45,110
of three rounds and a slide padding of

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:50,329
five rounds to scoop to everything in oh

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:54,230
okay should be great great yeah perfect

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:58,220
time for that donut after all right no

00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:00,290
no as soon as we change the window to be

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,559
a little bit skinnier than before it

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:05,509
starts to look a little odd and in

00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,089
reality if you have a responsive site

00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:14,569
your Tennessee skinny or Windows all the

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:16,970
time also oh that German it begins to

00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:18,740
look weird again okay well we'll do

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:24,110
better will iterate on this headline a

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:26,029
little so instead of just adding a big

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,160
giant margin just Guiche everything in

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:29,990
let's let's tone that down a little bit

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,610
or sorry padding we're going to change

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,220
the padding a little bit and make it

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,300
just three rounds in two rounds and then

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,190
we're going to give the headline the

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,930
more specific styling we're going to

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,000
make the headline element eighty five

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,740
percent of the width and we're going to

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,480
give it large and left auto and margin

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:50,089
right auto which is how we've been

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:53,540
centering elements for years okay okay

00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,920
great that looks pretty good here we are

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,569
highlighting the element than just

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,970
showing the padding on the outside that

00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:03,100
looks much better we still have the

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:05,720
squeeze effect on the headline super in

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,519
fact if we think ahead to what the

00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,259
content owners might do someone might

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,029
come along and add a paragraph to this

00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:13,250
element without even telling the poor

00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:15,050
developers first and it's still going to

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,240
look good because we've scooched in the

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,649
headline itself instead of kin trusting

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,220
that the container is going to take care

00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:23,899
of the big fat padding for us god it

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,839
still looks a little awkward in German

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:29,029
though I wish I wish there was something

00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,720
more to do about fallen hoon hanging out

00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:35,600
down at the bottom there ok tangent time

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,310
let's talk about widows and orphans has

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,269
anybody heard of the term widows and

00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:43,189
orphans before excellent excellent it's

00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:45,620
the single lines that are cut off from

00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:48,319
the bottom of their blocks this line of

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,959
text down here at the bottom that's a

00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:53,810
widow and this other line of text all

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,850
alone way up at the top that's an orphan

00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,500
you all know that this came from the

00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,670
days of print and typesetting when you

00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,410
would move your little blocks around

00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:05,300
then squish ink on it and in CSS widow

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,339
and orphan declarations are supported

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,069
when using page media when you're using

00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:11,569
print media type you can specify how

00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,610
many lines you want left alone at the

00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:17,300
end of the page or the top of a new page

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:20,660
and that's awesome that's cool you can

00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:25,399
also do it in columns sort of kind of in

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:28,339
some browsers these declarations in the

00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,170
CSS should mean that the browser will

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,809
attempt to rebalance all of the text in

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,670
the columns so that three is the fewest

00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:37,370
number of lines left alone either at the

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:40,730
top or the bottom of any single column

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:44,089
and in browses where it works

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:46,250
it works great currently it works in

00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:51,440
edge 20 that's the current version of

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:53,510
edge and iOS Safari eight awesome does

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:59,329
not work in the most recent version of

00:16:53,510 --> 00:17:01,040
Firefox or Chrome or OSX Safari okay

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:02,360
that's fine that's fine a progressive

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,140
enhancement it's fine you can just use

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,870
it and it'll be fine but wouldn't it be

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,750
great if we could use orphans for

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,130
something else let go imagine for me

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,220
this is not real this doesn't actually

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,439
work but imagine that you have a bunch

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,319
of elements like this more kittens which

00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,480
you laid out with flex box and at the

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,569
end you've got this one little kitten

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,459
hanging out all alone it's sad and

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:33,169
lonely and it's much too long and it

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:36,440
looks weird what if you could specify an

00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:39,770
orphans declaration on the containing

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,230
elements then the browser would stick

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:45,290
these two kittens together because we've

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,210
specified minimum number of children to

00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,360
be rendered after a soft line break is

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:53,690
too that would be awesome that would be

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:56,270
much better are you hearing me browser

00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:03,400
vendors orphans for other things pretty

00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:03,400
please thank you okay yeah okay

00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:11,910
yeah yeah this thing so we can also use

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,890
it to fix our headline for example we

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,230
could declare it would be great if we

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,630
could say that the minimum number of

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,820
words things separated by spaces left

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,590
alone at the bottom of the h1 would be

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,030
four and then the browser would just

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,440
steal some words above and make it

00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,020
balance just like it does for Collins

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:34,890
that would be wonderful if we could do

00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:39,380
it for our headline okay oh great so we

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:42,179
can't yet but maybe someday to be great

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,559
okay there's one I told you there were a

00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:46,730
lot of slides about headline but we're

00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,630
almost done there's one more reasonably

00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,660
labor-intensive thing that you can do if

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:55,020
you absolutely must to take care of line

00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:57,660
breaks to handle ugly-looking headlines

00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,270
in this image what we have is a yellow

00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,890
line that I drew in there to represent

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,820
the line break remember in the beginning

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:08,299
I put a hard line break in the mark-up

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:11,730
we can compare we can use this with

00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:14,190
media queries and we can hide the line

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,260
breaks in certain scenarios here for

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,090
view ports that are less than 500 pixels

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,320
wide we're going to display the line

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:25,020
break is normal that's fine swell cool

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,790
but for wider view ports the line breaks

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,419
still exists we're just not going to

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,640
show it so if you really must force line

00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,980
breaks into your code or allow your

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,900
content owners to force line breaks into

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,210
the content that they're writing you can

00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,900
absolutely show and hide them using

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:45,360
media queries so yeah that's pretty cool

00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,790
it's probably the best way right now to

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:53,760
handle the ugly headline but it's pretty

00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:56,400
labor-intensive so it's your call the

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,200
last saw mo I'm going to go back to

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,140
talking about the group of boxes because

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,669
we have some pretty good fixes for that

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,370
what we want what the comp says is that

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,470
we're going to have three boxes all side

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,290
by side they're all going to be the same

00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,940
height and they're going to be nicely

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,890
aligned the paragraphs are going to

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,990
start at the same place and the

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,549
call-to-action buttons are going to

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,039
start at the same place

00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,619
now back in the day you might have done

00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:24,690
this with tables because when you use

00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:27,749
tables you get all that alignment

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:31,019
between rows for free and that's awesome

00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:33,389
but this is not tabular data so we're

00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,610
not going to use tables it's also going

00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:38,220
to look pretty terrible when we need a

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:41,009
single column view for a mobile kind of

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,759
browser with let's let's take a look at

00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:47,070
how we might accomplish this the mark-up

00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,749
is you know not too exciting we're going

00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:51,149
to use a section to contain all three of

00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:52,919
the boxes and then inside there we're

00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:55,200
going to have a div with a class of

00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,210
group contain each of the columns in

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,639
there and each of those contains a

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:04,289
headline and a paragraph and a button

00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:05,730
pretty standard pretty awesome the

00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:08,429
styling we're going to start out pretty

00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,499
simple at least these days we get curved

00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:13,470
corners almost for free so that's

00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:15,029
awesome so we're going to curve the

00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,190
corners with good old border radius

00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:21,919
we're going to send you some things add

00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,919
some background colors cool simple stuff

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,399
we're going to do a lot of work on the

00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:28,799
button but it's not too exciting really

00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:30,980
the most exciting thing on the button is

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,359
that we're going to give it a width of

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,269
sixty percent and we're going to send to

00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,070
write using margin again and let's talk

00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:40,109
for a minute about why we can send your

00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,269
things using margin auto on the left and

00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:45,899
margin auto on the right that's kind of

00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:48,779
weird why does it work well what happens

00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:50,489
is that the auto Declaration takes all

00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,649
of the available space on the side that

00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:54,239
it's talking about and then it uses that

00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:56,340
and it's okay that's my space now and

00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:58,169
then it divides that between everything

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,389
that's going to use some of that space

00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:03,149
so auto on the left takes half the

00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:05,309
available space auto on the right takes

00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:07,049
half the available space and thus the

00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:09,179
element which is no longer a hundred

00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:12,690
percent of the width is centered inside

00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:17,489
its container so that's that's my maybe

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:21,029
interesting about auto we'll see okay

00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:23,159
cool let's take care of the boxes for

00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:25,049
each of the groups to keep them all the

00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,639
same height and side by side we're going

00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:30,749
to use our friend flexbox now again

00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,320
flexbox still need some prefixing

00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,740
another brow

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,300
so check out can I use or the Mozilla

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,380
developer network to see what you need

00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,080
to add to get it to work in your

00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,810
browser's flexbox is great because it

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,060
gives us this auto alignment the it's

00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,560
set to stretch by default everything's

00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,090
the same height all of that comes pretty

00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,030
much for free the only thing I had to

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:56,640
add was display flex on the parent

00:22:51,030 --> 00:23:00,090
section so that's awesome and we're also

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:04,500
going to set display flex inside each of

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:07,260
these container boxes we don't want to

00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,720
use the default direction of rows

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:13,650
instead we want the Flex direction

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,870
inside these to be columns so that's

00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:19,680
cool I don't know it didn't really make

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:22,710
a big difference inside but what it does

00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,770
do it sets us up to move all of the

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,060
buttons to the bottom and the reason

00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:31,050
that all the buttons are at the bottom

00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:33,690
is that I've set the margin top to the

00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,400
auto before I mentioned that auto takes

00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,100
up all of this vailable space and

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,590
flexbox it does that on the top two so

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:44,340
now all of these buttons just have huge

00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:47,400
margins when they can from the top of

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:49,620
their available space so margin auto

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,390
within flexbox scooches everything down

00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,270
to the bottom all of our buttons are

00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:56,850
aligned that's awesome the only thing we

00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:00,650
need to do is to get those paragraphs of

00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:02,940
copy aligned ah how do we do that

00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,680
they're all within different parents

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,400
they don't inherently have any

00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:10,020
relationship to them to each other so

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,330
we're going to have to cheat it's going

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:15,120
to be okay what we're going to do is

00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,830
we're going to steal some of the margin

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,320
for our H ones we're going to set that

00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:21,810
to margin zero steal that margin and

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,490
instead we're going to tell them that

00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:29,220
each of these elements has a minimum

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:31,620
height of 10 our EMS of 10 rounds so

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:36,300
instead this white space is just made up

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:39,060
by this element having a height now in

00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,190
cases where the headline contents are

00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,540
actually taller than 10 REMS what's

00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,160
going to happen

00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,410
is it's going to push the paragraphs

00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,080
down and every box is going to have the

00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,880
same bottom line to it the boxes are

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,980
still going to be aligned but the

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,240
paragraphs won't be because one

00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,310
paragraph will be pushed down much

00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,150
further by its headline than the other

00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,950
ones and I think that's okay because the

00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,930
alternate option if we were to use just

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:07,590
height instead of men height would mean

00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:09,150
that for very long hy elements we would

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,580
be cut off at the bottom when the

00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,650
content don't fit inside the elements so

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,200
I think it's better to suffer some

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:20,400
layout to some layout breakage than to

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:23,640
kill content for the users wow so that

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,830
was a lot of CSS that I just threw at

00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,830
you all let's let's take a look at what

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:31,080
we did already today we looked at how to

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,450
position a caption at the bottom of its

00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,970
parent using position relative to

00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:39,330
capture the containing context and also

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:44,340
how to size it based on its parent using

00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:47,250
Mac's content which is very awesome we

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,990
looked at how to use the language a

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:52,380
tribute and the same language

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:54,570
pseudo-class to do any kind of quote

00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,610
marks that you want and this will allow

00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,050
you to any styling that you want

00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,850
different for different languages if

00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,800
it's necessary for your site you can

00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:07,020
increase the type chinese text size but

00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:10,140
only for chinese we talked about how to

00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:13,080
use text transform how it's changed with

00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,760
the recent CSS module updates and how

00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,770
maybe you want to be really really

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:22,080
deliberate and thoughtful before just

00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:25,040
throwing it on your headlines we talked

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,930
about a wish for using orphans and widow

00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,980
declarations in things other than paged

00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:36,150
media or columns that would be pretty

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:38,550
swell we talked a lot about how you can

00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,860
corral headlines down to pin this the

00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,120
page size I think that the best standard

00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,790
solution is just to give it a different

00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,500
with and center it but you can also show

00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:50,940
and hide the line breaks if you really

00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:54,570
want to and we also talked about how can

00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,420
use flex box to magically auto align a

00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,040
bunch of things inside there

00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:05,310
most interestingly i think is the way

00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:07,410
the top margin auto works so of course

00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:10,020
you can combine any of these techniques

00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:12,840
as you need to I think the important

00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,790
thing to think about is to plan for the

00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,010
text size that you put out there to vary

00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,770
because content owners are going to

00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,870
change it users who up their font size

00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:24,270
are going to change it and even if you

00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,850
include any content that's dynamic from

00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:28,680
a database or from the users or from

00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,500
translations that's going to change the

00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:35,630
size of boxes that you need on your

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,630
website so just go ahead and plan for it

00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:42,750
building a robust site that survived the

00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:44,640
localization process is going to be

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:49,200
building a site which handles all of

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,870
these so that's what I came to talk

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,620
about again if you want you can get the

00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:57,990
links from KDK to github do /

00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,390
localizations or you can follow me on

00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,210
twitter or read them up my blog which I

00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,890
swear really is pew pew lasercom I've
