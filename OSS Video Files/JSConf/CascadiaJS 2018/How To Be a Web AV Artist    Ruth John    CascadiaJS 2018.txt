Title: How To Be a Web AV Artist    Ruth John    CascadiaJS 2018
Publication date: 2018-12-10
Playlist: CascadiaJS 2018
Description: 
	Come and be fascinated by the world of audio visualisation in a browser. This isnâ€™t just about creating stunning data vis to music! We see how we can pipe data realtime into custom properties to enhance our visuals. Ruth will re-address how we analyse sound via the Web Audio API and proposes a better way of processing the data to better suit music. And, to top it all off, we harness the Web MIDI API for full hardware control as well. You may not think it, but this really is a talk with a great deal of take-aways and new techniques for you to consider in your coding life.

damn good too but you can't be any geek

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,010
off the street gotta be handy with the

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:20,070
steel if you know what I'm a nerd you

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:21,869
keep yeah you're like gonna do a

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,519
soundcheck we're going I'll say yeah for

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:31,470
sure and then that just mucked up that

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:33,960
whole entire opening today yes okay it's

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,280
Friday evening we are gonna get ready

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,040
come on

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:43,620
I feel like it's a half-empty house yeah

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,320
my name is Ruth they flew me in to play

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,860
hip hop they've done that thank you very

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,020
much I know very disclaimer I kind of

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,870
done it already that is sound and there

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,010
is flashing visuals in this talk I will

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,160
try and warn you when they do you get

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,649
super flashy but yes just if you don't

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,799
like it look away leave I won't be I

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,840
won't be offended honestly so yes my

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,080
name is Ruth this is the part of the

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,430
talk where people introduce themselves

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,010
they tell you what they've done who they

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,750
work for why they should be on stage

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,590
teaching you or telling you about a

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,590
certain thing except etc I'm gonna show

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,130
you that's the easiest way because I'm

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:34,200
here to talk to you about how to be a

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:36,000
web AV artist what exactly right AV by

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,350
the way stands for audio vision I'll get

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,229
back to to that in a minute

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,750
but yeah I struggle with the

00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:45,240
practicality of this talk like how many

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,390
of you are gonna go back into your jobs

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:52,549
on Monday and just code some AV into

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,549
your website or your web app right

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,280
I have no better talk anxiety and I came

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:03,420
across this helpful Venn diagram on

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,729
Twitter which is also helpful and what

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,560
it is it's on the left you've got what

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,050
people talk about in conference talks

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,700
which isn't so helpful and on the right

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,120
you've got what you want to hear in

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,280
conference talks which is how

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,550
so I've taken this quite literally and

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,380
I've made myself two lists okay so on

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,200
the Left I've got things that I need to

00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,060
avoid and on the right I've got things

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,390
that I need to include so on the Left

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,750
I've got analytics operational

00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,819
excellence chat opps and orchestration

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,280
those are the things that I have to

00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:41,470
avoid in this talk to make this a useful

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,800
talk but I do have to include duct-tape

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:48,709
workarounds bike shedding and coffee

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,160
right okay now my talk anxiety is out

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:54,739
the way we can again by the way I'm

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,690
losing a joy Khan this could break at

00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:01,720
any time okay so Amy what is an AV

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,069
artist a V stands for audio

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,500
visualization okay so what we're doing

00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:08,810
is we're taking audio and we're making

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,850
visualizations from it so it's not so

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,980
much of the creating audio as it is

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,080
creating visualizations based on the

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,650
audio that we have another name for this

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:24,470
is Vijay got control of my audio so this

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:26,209
is pretty loud who remembers this I was

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,820
like I'm gonna do that again because I

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:30,440
was like um I got old audio all the way

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:35,720
through this talk please don't turn down

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:38,989
the levels who remembers this oh my

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,000
goodness no working is it there is a

00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,810
sound bite for that I'm gonna try it one

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,180
more time one more time audio people

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:55,340
because it's pretty cool we're there now

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:57,170
it really whips the llamas ass thank you

00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,160
oh can we keep the audio levels up for

00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,450
the rest of the tour please there is

00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,989
audio where they do this talk thank you

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:05,359
very much we ramp the greatest mp3

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:08,269
player of all time right for those of

00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:10,700
you that don't know when I'm because I'm

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:13,670
of a certain age it basically just plays

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,039
mp3 and other audio files when we used

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,630
to listen to audio files and not stream

00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:20,870
them like we used to own the files we

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,460
used to share them via Napster right but

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,620
this wasn't the best thing about winner

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,440
no no the best thing about winner was

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,020
this it had a visualization

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,900
engine right so you can play your music

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,310
and you'd whip this up and all these

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,620
visuals would go in time to the music

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,360
and you just sit and watch this for

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,520
hours I said this is probably the most

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,840
influential thing of any VJ of my

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,670
generation um so I was thinking a few

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,860
years ago say okay we've got some cool

00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:53,990
browser api's now what if I could do

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:56,540
this in a browser good idea I'm gonna

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,190
take you to some ways that I have come

00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,890
to actually be able to do this in a

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:05,210
browser the first thing that we need is

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:07,910
audio right we have a Web Audio API and

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,210
there's probably yes it's my favorite

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,210
one too

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,440
there's sort of four main ways to get

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,910
audio with the Web Audio API you can

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,160
grab it from the DOM if you've got a

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,200
video or an audio element in your Dom

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,120
you could just grab the audio from that

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,280
and you can push it through the API and

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,230
you can stream it from your device if

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,730
you've got a camera microphone you can

00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,460
grab the audio from that and you can

00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,780
stream it through the API you can go and

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,030
get a file you can go and get a sound

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,950
file when you get a sound file you do

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,660
have to decode it into the API you sort

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,830
of got to buffer it in because sound

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,450
files by and large are sort of

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,130
compressed and you've got to make the

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,900
audio api understand the data of the

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,730
sound file so we decode it into what we

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,150
call a buffer and then we can use that

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:52,040
data you can also create sounds the Web

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,600
Audio API so here I'm using an

00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,970
oscillator to create a sound which is

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,919
creating a sound wave you can also use

00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,410
that but at buffer that I just mentioned

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,000
earlier and you can put your own data

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,440
into that so you can create things like

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,440
white noise quite easily which is just

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,720
random numbers and the ones that I'm

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,380
sort of interested in either like using

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,919
a sound file so this example uses a

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,919
sound file

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,840
and this one's actually just picking up

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:29,520
on my mic so this one is me it gets very

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,350
quiet then it gets really loud yeah the

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,090
next thing that we need now that we've

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,990
got some sound is we need to analyze

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:40,050
that sound ha ha I wasn't allowed to

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,639
talk about analytics it's okay we've got

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,720
a whole rest of the tour to go it's fine

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,800
we'll be fine

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,360
ok ok we need to analyze that sound

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,210
because we want to use that data to make

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,520
our visualizations that's cool we can do

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,070
that with the Web Audio API as well it

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,350
has the functionality for you to be able

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,020
to analyze any sound that it's in it

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,000
right what we're doing here is we're

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,830
creating analyzer node a lot of the Web

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,110
Audio API is sort of based around this

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,750
idea of nodes I'm not going to go into

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,460
too much detail about it now but if you

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,560
do want to know more about a Web Audio

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,060
API come and talk to me later

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,550
I would tell you all about it um

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,410
somebody wrote some cool stuff on env

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,419
and Doc's about it so you can go there

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,919
there's some cool demos now and there's

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,410
plenty of resources out there and I can

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,470
point you in the right direction what

00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:32,130
the analyzer node gives us back is an

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:36,210
array of data now that data is the

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:39,900
frequency amplitudes I know right it's

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:42,000
basically it's the low sounds all the

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,699
way through to the high sounds and the

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,760
sort of volume value of all those sounds

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,590
at any given point so the first few

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,360
items in the array are going to be the

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,260
low sounds and the last few items in

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,539
that array are going to be the higher

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,400
sounds and the data in that item of the

00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:59,550
array is just gonna be the volume value

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,639
right and then we can use that to make

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,320
our visualizations so here all I've got

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,910
is a bunch of elements in the DOM and

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,340
I'm just taking those values and

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,870
changing the height of those elements

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,900
based on what I'm getting back from that

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:17,030
analysis if it's gone yet HTML CSS

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,770
really simple took me about two months

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:23,159
so just leaping over those elements and

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,020
I'm just changing the height of them now

00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,700
this is the sort of crux of everything

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,010
once you've got that an

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,000
is going on you're getting that data

00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:33,300
everything becomes a little bit easier

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,010
so so I started a whole bunch of

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,600
experiments now everything everybody

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,600
knows when you start a bunch of

00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,130
experiments you need some inspiration

00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,110
this is my inspiration for my first

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,510
bunch of experiments this is a super

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,010
cool artist Bridget Riley you know she's

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:51,540
a super cool artist cuz it says on the

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:55,050
slide I saw her exhibition and she makes

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,600
a new Pacey's huge pictures of shapes

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,820
and she experiments herself with these

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,410
shapes and I just was walking around I

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,420
said oh I've got to try visualizing

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,160
these these are really really good so

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,740
this is the first one this is just a

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,760
whole bunch of sections and they were

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,410
just they were all kind of long just set

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,060
out with flexbox and I'm just changing

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,310
the width of them based on the data that

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,620
I'm going back

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,360
this one is that triangle CSS border

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,030
hack that you've seen and I'm just

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,890
changing the opacity of them again based

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,850
on that sort of numbers that I'm getting

00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:32,250
back from the analysis data when you do

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,900
when you start experimenting it gives

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,820
you a good opportunity to try any things

00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,590
this is a couple of years ago and I'm

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,450
sort of thinking you know how else can

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,670
we expand this and one of the things

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,170
that I really wanted to try was some

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,180
transforms and getting familiar with

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,860
those and I thought wouldn't it be nice

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,150
if you could take whatever you have in

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,760
there Dom because I'm still working with

00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:54,720
just dorm elements and sort of copy it

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,340
and rotate and reflect it around the

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,400
rest the Dom so you shrink it down and

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:02,910
you just copy copy it around like like

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,500
this right so this is only one square

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,210
and I'm just running a little JavaScript

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,700
function to copy that and then I'm just

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,170
reflecting and rotating it around and I

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,630
thought hey this is just stuff in the

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,400
Dom so um I mean this is my competitive

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,110
elements but you know you can drop

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,260
anything into the Dom maybe I could just

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:22,110
drop an animated gif into the Dom yeah

00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:26,250
you could do that too might look Pony

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:29,160
gifts and we've got so cool like

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,600
visualizations and some other lovely CSS

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,620
things because I've come to a JavaScript

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,170
conference so I thought I'd talk about

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,480
CSS that I wanted to try with blend

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,400
modes and filters say blend modes if you

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,920
are unsure I just you can sort of see

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,660
through

00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,310
like elements underneath in different

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,200
ways you can darken you can lighten them

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,850
and filters which will become more

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,290
apparent a bit later and so you can

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,630
invert stuff you can turn things

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,300
grayscale you can blur them all really

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,970
cool visual things and browser this is a

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,010
visualization I did for jazz company you

00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:59,800
and I by this point I'm starting to move

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,170
over to SVG's so these are all SVG

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,199
shapes and you can put blend filter like

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,180
blend mode on SVG's and I'm just putting

00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:08,620
like a lighting mode on these because it

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,550
becomes just a little bit brighter and

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:15,820
it just gives it a little bit more depth

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:17,889
one more sort of CSS thing custom

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,079
properties I'm sure we've probably all

00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:21,820
seen them we probably are all using them

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,540
now and this is the idea of sort of

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,339
variables in CSS right so you declare

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,199
the variable that you want to use your

00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:31,389
custom property you do that in a Dom

00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,949
element further at the tree so we've got

00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,510
a dash dash level so as long as you

00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:36,579
start it with - - and call it whatever

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,740
you want I've got a level here I'm

00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,269
setting it to a default value and then

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,709
I'm using that value under the

00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:44,649
property's width and height later on in

00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:46,089
my CSS now the thing about custom

00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:48,279
property is a really good thing which I

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,949
was enjoying is you can update them in

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,410
real time right they're not set at

00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:54,730
runtime you can you can just update them

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,820
in the browser and they will update and

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,160
you can do this with JavaScript so in my

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,500
JavaScript I can take that analysis

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,970
value and pipe it straight into that

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,390
custom property and it will update my

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:10,920
CSS for me in real time this JavaScript

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,490
all up in your CSS so here I've got like

00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,070
document.documentelement style set

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,870
property and I'm setting - - level with

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,649
that analysis level that I'm getting

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:24,430
back so this is an example of me doing

00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:26,050
all of those things we've got some Dom

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,519
elements they're being rotated and

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,470
reflective got some blend modes going on

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,810
I'm doing some custom properties and as

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:35,740
you can see it's a little bit janky it

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:39,730
kinda doesn't like operate very well to

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:44,490
talk about operational excellence - cave

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:46,750
- down what this can still go either way

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:51,040
so thinking about the performance of all

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:52,570
of this and this is my friend Ben

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,070
if you don't take anything else away

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,440
from this talk because I'm talking about

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,090
making crazy visualizations in a browser

00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,680
talk to your friends about things and

00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,140
not just for rubber ducky

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,110
bugs but your actual project because

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,960
they might have some other better ideas

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:10,060
so I was chatting to been not allowed to

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,680
talk about chops oh my goodness me that

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:16,470
was like - in like two minutes

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,940
Oh orchestration I'll make it useful -

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,100
so I was talking to Ben

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,090
we were team this is this is all going

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,110
to the realm of doing something quite

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,730
interactive with it

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,620
and he made the good point he's sort of

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,600
saying well you're doing a lot of stuff

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,850
with SVG's you're doing a lot of stuff

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,320
with data you're working with the Dom

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:36,040
yet you're kind of doing a lot of maths

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,320
have you thought about using d3 now

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,570
d3.js being the data visualization

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,330
library which back then I was thinking

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,890
yeah this is sort of pie charts I'm not

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,500
sure some people have done some

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,660
incredible stuff with d3 since but yeah

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,460
he had a point I'm doing lots of stuff

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,160
with data the analysis time getting back

00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,470
from the audio is data I'm doing a lot

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,670
of work with the Dom and it's pretty

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,010
good at that it's pretty good at Dom

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,740
hoping I'm doing a lot of maths actually

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,390
a lot of the positioning things and

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,920
working things around and there's some

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,810
really nice features of d3 which which

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,070
deal with mass pretty well and I just

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,040
started working with SVG's and by

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:14,490
default that's how do you three works so

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,350
this begins my next set of experiments

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:21,700
this is a book by Tim Lyon called super

00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:23,470
graphic it charts data from comics and

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,940
graphic novels if you like comics in

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,440
graphic novels I highly recommend it

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,300
it's really beautiful just a flick

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,710
through and so I was peeking through

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,600
this and I was like maybe I should try

00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,330
and visualize some of these this looks

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,610
really cool this is a your basic

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,260
sunburst chart so again this is all

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,330
picking up on my mic so this is just me

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,480
speaking and sort of moving around as

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:47,770
I'm talking and I sort of started to

00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:52,620
gain momentum this is a really cool of

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:55,750
waynebow this one looks good in a club

00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,340
this one reimagines the spectrum from

00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,110
earlier instead of doing lines and

00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,230
landing circles and they're just going

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,400
diagonally across across the screen and

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,570
this one which is a little personal

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,190
favorite because it's kind of small

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,540
sweet it's very similar to the last one

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,870
you just got a little flower which is

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:13,060
just going around I'm all pretty it's

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,590
gonna stay easy nothing's easy but when

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,450
you're using d3 you're just sort of

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,090
copying and it's it is making things a

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,560
little bit easier

00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,660
what do you three does is it takes each

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,780
item in the array and creates a shape

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,970
like an SVG SVG shape per item you get

00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,530
to define that which is kind of what I

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,930
was doing with the Dom it's just I was

00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:34,540
doing a little bit more work to do it

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,520
and one of the problems with this wasn't

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,410
D through and what d3 was doing it was

00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,590
the data that I was getting back from

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:44,380
the Web Audio API I think the data could

00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,820
have been better now this is gonna get a

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,940
little bit hard to explain and I'm gonna

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:52,240
try it anyway these frequency values

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:56,770
these sounds from low to high they run

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,800
from naught Hertz very low to 20,000

00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:02,500
Hertz very high right this is what the

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,690
human ear hears I'm a little bit older

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,910
probably don't hear 20,000 Hertz now but

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,980
that's the data that we get back so

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,210
that's split up with however many items

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,940
that you want to put in that around you

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:15,670
get to define that but one of the issues

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:19,090
that we have with that as music doesn't

00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:21,100
run that high music this is a musical

00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,990
keyboard it probably sits around here on

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,320
that scale probably goes around up to

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,430
around 8,000 kilohertz so when you're

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,590
listening to music and you're analyzing

00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,940
music there's a hole but there's a whole

00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:34,570
bunch of items often this top end of the

00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,460
array that you just don't need the other

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:40,330
problem when you're analyzing audio like

00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:42,690
music audio is this we've got three

00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:45,190
notes on this musical keyboard here

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:47,530
they're actually all the same note in

00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,470
musical terms that will a but they are

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:52,870
all an octave apart so they're all eight

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,280
notes twelve semitones part equal spaces

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,350
apart and when you play them together

00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,540
they're very very harmonious that's why

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,220
they will have the same letter but some

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,920
one low and got in mid one and we've got

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,500
a high one now they're equal spaces on

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,699
the keyboard but that middle key there

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,290
the orange one oh sure you can see the

00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:11,910
orange that middle key I've highlighted

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:14,589
that's a middle a that runs at 440 Hertz

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:17,079
the one below it the one that's

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,829
highlighted below at the purple one 220

00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,470
Hertz that's a

00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:24,100
of 220 if I can still do maths on a

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:27,130
Friday um the one above it runs at 880

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,169
Hertz there's a gap of 440 you see what

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,399
happened the gaps doubled so even the

00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:32,230
amount even though the amount of Keys

00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:34,870
hasn't doubled the amount of frequency

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,760
Hertz has doubled so this is a problem

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,559
because the analysis that we get back

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,740
from the array from Web Audio is linear

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,470
and musical notes that really work in

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,230
linear so I thought it'd be really nice

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:50,289
if we had better analysis of the Web

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,630
Audio API so it chopped off the top of

00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:55,110
the array that was pretty simple and

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:59,260
then I spread the rest of the data out

00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:01,690
yeah magic function took me about six

00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,730
months I haven't actually looked at this

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:06,760
for about a year cuz I just wrote it and

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,440
I left it's working this is great and

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,299
weirdly uh so we're looking at today and

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,830
I was just randomly doing some stuff

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,899
with WebGL recently I've been doing some

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,130
shade of stuff and I'm pretty sure that

00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:16,779
there's some algorithms that I'm doing

00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,250
with that which would actually make this

00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:19,690
better

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,159
so there is a version of this online

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,570
that you can go and have a look at but

00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,360
I'm hoping that I can refactor it to be

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,830
even better soon so that's what this is

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:34,000
doing and then just to prove that it

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:37,450
actually works this is before so we've

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,279
got on the right there is where the

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,110
shape starts so this is the lower end of

00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,380
that right and you can say you that it's

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,760
there see it's bigger and then this is

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,960
after I run the functions

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,610
everything's just spread out a little

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,779
bit more and we've just got a better

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,779
amount of data

00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,600
what about canvas so at the moment I'm

00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,370
still using like SPG's and it's still

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,990
kind of a little bit heavier if I'm

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,340
honest and when I started putting more

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,690
items into that array and started

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,029
chucking more shapes into the DOM and

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,860
but I did start to see a lot more

00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:10,990
performance problems d3 really wasn't

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,549
necessarily the answer so then I started

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,740
to work on 2d canvas which is the one

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:16,779
that you saw at the top of the talk and

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,100
this is a lot cleaner it does it like

00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:20,080
it's kind of running because I'm running

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,309
so many things will happen right now but

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,990
when you run this alone this does work

00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:26,080
better and I can just chuck so many

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:28,840
shapes and it's brilliant if you want to

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,160
see all of these they are on co pen most

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,680
of my co-founders audio-visual eyes

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,380
so you can see that journey from when we

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,970
sort of begin from not being able to do

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,560
very much all we have been doing some

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:45,310
canvas visualizations if you're

00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:46,840
interested one last bit yeah this is

00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,990
great we've got some visualizations but

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,720
to really be able to sort of bj2 a band

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,550
or like to DJ in a club which that would

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,200
be cool right I need to be able to

00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,420
control these now I can probably control

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,240
them using the keyboard on my on my

00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:03,360
laptop there are some other api's which

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,130
are fun like gamepad API is pretty fun

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,500
but like if I find it a little flaky

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,050
I'm really glad this is holding out it's

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,810
still holding out to go a web MIDI API

00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:16,270
right we actually are able to run MIDI

00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,980
in a browser I'm just a little bit about

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,050
meeting you just a little rundown and

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:25,020
it's not those beeping noises that you

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:27,760
hear right it is a data protocol so the

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,830
instruments can talk to each other it

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,630
was it came about because of the rise of

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,600
popularity of electronic instruments in

00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,730
the 70s so in 1983 a group of industry

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,530
experts and electric electronic music

00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,540
manufacturers got together and they put

00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,570
together a specification you know an

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,700
open specification they're pretty cool

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:48,040
so these sort of electronic instruments

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,160
could sort of parse out data and they'll

00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,500
be able to listen to each other this is

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,000
a MIDI enabled instrument this is the

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,320
musical keyboard we saw earlier and

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,640
probably show you for C Mon you're

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:04,960
producing a piano it's very very similar

00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:07,060
the thing about this is it it's an

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,060
instrument because it has onboard audio

00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:12,490
so when you play it you are listening to

00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,310
sounds but it's also MIDI enabled so it

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,350
is passing out those that those data

00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:21,280
messages so that it can orchestrate with

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:22,990
other instruments how could I do talk

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,380
about audio without talking about

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,730
orchestration it's okay I'm hoping that

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,050
at least at some point in this talk

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,450
you've got something useful out of it

00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,100
never might so this is what an

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,720
instrument is and we talk about music

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,100
with MIDI instruments we're talking

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,710
about things that onboard audio on and

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,530
there's lots of these out there this is

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,820
a MIDI controller very similar and you

00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,270
plug it into your computer you can pick

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,800
up on me

00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,600
data that it's sending and but it

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,310
doesn't have any onboard audio this is

00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,930
what I have with me today it's actually

00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:54,550
one of these it's what we call a launch

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:57,400
pad great so basically I can press

00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,500
button well I can run this code say what

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,360
you do in the browser is you you request

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,740
access to these many devices there's

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,520
lots and lots of MIDI controllers out

00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,200
there by the way if you want to get

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,340
started just google MIDI controllers and

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,110
some of them are really really

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,170
affordable around sort of 30 bucks I

00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:13,900
think from doing dollars and you just

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,160
plug it in and you request access to it

00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,870
and then you can just listen for its

00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,280
events and all you're getting back is

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,590
some data which you can then hook into

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,080
and you can do some stuff with so

00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,970
hopefully if this is working working I'm

00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,130
pressing buttons on this controller this

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,330
is the data that you get back it's just

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,130
some numbers and you can listen for

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,260
those numbers what they sort of mean is

00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:35,170
I am this MIDI controller you're

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,370
pressing this button and for those like

00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,080
there are some where you can press it

00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,630
harder and you get different funnies you

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,860
don't on this one but you know just

00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,470
pressing buttons I'm going getting

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,300
numbers and so this means that I'm going

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,070
to go flashing now so be aware this is

00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,810
gonna get flashy this means I can sort

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,940
of easily add effects to these visuals

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:54,220
so we can go back and Y we can change

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,010
the colors and go blurry I can do

00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,690
something vertie

00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:01,450
but also it means that in the actual

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:04,540
thing that I use I can change what it is

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,610
I'm showing on screen I can actually mix

00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,890
two visuals together with like you get

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,240
like cc's which are like dials so you

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:16,810
can actually mix things together in a

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:19,870
browser there's any of this real like

00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:21,970
what are we doing oh like you know

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:24,220
analyzing audio making crazy

00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:27,280
visualizations and plugging in boxes of

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:30,670
buttons um this is me with a portable VJ

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:33,100
pack I took a hand bag I put my laptop

00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,750
in I've got like a mini projector take

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,550
one of MIDI controllers and I kind of

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,290
hacked the handbag so you can actually

00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,360
unzip it in a certain way and it like

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,440
acts as an usherette tray and you can

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,580
just plug the little projector at the

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,830
bottom you can just walk around

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,200
projecting onto staff which is what I

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,660
did this is this is me doing in my in my

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,150
streets my city back in the UK and I

00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,470
write a blog post about this and someone

00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,450
on the Internet's found the blog post

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,650
because the Internet's are cool and they

00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,450
say

00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:00,720
I'm doing this tune I think what are you

00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:03,180
doing and actually it's a whole group of

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,680
us doing it record low J s we don't just

00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,620
do visuals there's a couple of people

00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,750
out there that make software software

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,710
that plays music with JavaScript there's

00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,630
a couple of people out there that

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,070
actually control whole lighting rigs

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,170
with software that they've built in

00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:19,020
JavaScript if you want to check us out

00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:22,640
on live Jay s Network we actually we pay

00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:25,020
gigs which is slightly insane I think

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,610
but it works and we do it and it is

00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,530
great fun and we talk to each other

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,790
about with a crazy technology that we

00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:32,190
use and they're great people to talk to

00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:37,320
and we also have a github repo so as far

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:39,630
as I'm concerned that must be real it's

00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,790
the end of the story this was a couple

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,950
of years ago since then performance

00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,090
still was an issue when you've got like

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,650
two canvases running because you're

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,790
mixing with them and you've got all

00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,860
these shapes going on you're analyzing

00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,780
that audio as well I started looking

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,160
into workers so web workers have been a

00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,530
big help that's really helped with

00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,730
performance

00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,559
recently I started working with WebGL

00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,660
which means I could be running

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,090
everything on a 3d context instead of a

00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,440
2d context which means automatically on

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,090
a lot of hardware I will be on the GPU

00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,490
instead of the CPU so that's been pretty

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,960
cool I also have been doing some stuff

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,240
for this code member because it's

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,580
November so if you want to check out

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,380
Mike opener as a whole bunch of audio

00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,809
visualizations based on the genitive

00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,220
asked artist recom which is a website

00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,690
that Tim home and put up at the

00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,530
beginning of this year and it just goes

00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,910
through if you just want to do some

00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,679
creative coding here just go through and

00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,970
do some of his tutorials and just

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,600
there's some really nice generative art

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:33,059
tutorials I've got 40 seconds according

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,230
to that timer I want to address one last

00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:40,110
thing before I go write this see I think

00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:42,300
this is useful to look for the keen-eyed

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,760
among you you might have noticed the

00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,300
whole Portofino pack held together with

00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,820
duct tape

00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,740
I lost audio again this kind of sucks

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,350
and I'm gonna turn it all the way up

00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:57,500
okay yeah the poor Pavitra pack code

00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:57,500
together with duct tape Ben is on a bike

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:11,930
around and most useful tour ever thank

00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,520
you very much my name is reto and you

00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,810
can find me at a tree Maira come and

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,050
talk to me after and talk about any of

00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,850
this

00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,010
the music in this is by a girl called at

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,380
Kanoa she's based in London check her

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:27,949
out on soundcloud thank you very much

00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:27,949
