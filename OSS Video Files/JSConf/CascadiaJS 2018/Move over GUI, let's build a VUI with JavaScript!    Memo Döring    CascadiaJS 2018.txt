Playlist: CascadiaJS 2018
Description: 
	The ability to use our voice to to interact with technology opens up a whole new world of posibilites for users, designers and developers. Join us at this session where we will talk about the best practices we have uncovered in the rapidly evolving voice first ecosystem. The session will include a live-coding demo on using AWS Lambda to building and deploy a VUI in minutes.

hi there everybody so I do realize I'm

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,750
the last thing between you guys and

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,010
lunch so I'm gonna try and be as brief

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,660
as I can

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,840
we're gonna be talking about building

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,960
voice you eyes using JavaScript just a

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,859
couple of slides on Who I am my name is

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,710
memo that is actually my real name I am

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,240
from Mexico and I love sneakers so those

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,560
are three things about me if you ever

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,590
want to talk about any of those things

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,869
I'm available for that oh and I use

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,620
JavaScript weird so I don't make

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:37,320
webpages I don't know a lot about

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,719
client-side JavaScript my whole

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,350
experience with javascript is node

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:47,180
server list for voice when I joined the

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,649
Alexa team I really hadn't ever done

00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,670
JavaScript development I came over from

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,710
a different company that used a

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,570
different technology stack but these

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,090
three years have been an incredible ride

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,739
it's been a lot of fun I'm really happy

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,640
that I get to work on the stuff that I

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:07,220
get to work we like to use this slide to

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:12,180
talk about you is so voice you eyes are

00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:15,119
a big thing for Amazon we really truly

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,799
believe in these we think they are going

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,380
to change how we interact with computers

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,060
what we don't believe is that they're

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,040
here to kill all the other user

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,689
interfaces you might have seen a lot of

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,939
clickbait articles at some point talking

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,780
about that that's just someone trying to

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,909
make a living out of your clicks so

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,650
we've all at some point used character

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,420
mode right we type something in there or

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,390
we've used the graphical user interface

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,210
most of us do web stuff web pages

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,579
definitely change the game when it came

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,009
to you eyes and mobile development and

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,930
react reactive design and all these

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,990
different things we're a big paradigm

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,909
shift so we've seen these changes go

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,820
along but I like to think about it a

00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,479
little bit more like this where we have

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:05,250
multiple you eyes these exist but we

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:08,550
choose which one we use based on the

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,240
type of work we're doing I don't foresee

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,060
a future where I tell my

00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:20,750
terminal to navigate to a specific

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:25,790
folder and then do NPM I - - save some

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:28,550
package right AASK - SDK from a language

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,940
perspective that is not how I talk and

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:35,360
also it is very hard to say and to hear

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,670
so there's going to be very different

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,650
user interfaces for very different tasks

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,660
and that's okay I'm just here to talk a

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,690
little bit about voice as a user

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,510
interface so the first thing I wanted to

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,850
talk about is how do Alexa scales

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,770
actually work so quick show of hands I

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:56,780
think I can see if I cover my eyes who's

00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:58,460
built voice you UI of any sort alright a

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,470
couple a couple hands in there so you

00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,180
guys are old pros I'm just gonna take

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,870
the rest of us on a quick little right

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,660
here about house voice skills on Alexa

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,390
work and the way it works is here's a

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,180
quick 10,000 foot view of it we got the

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,830
user on the left side we got your code

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,660
that you would deploy on the right side

00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,480
in the middle we've got a handy-dandy

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,220
device called an echo and actually have

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,250
one up here and I'm gonna do a quick

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:31,910
little demo for you

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:37,670
Alexa start Cascadia Jas hi Cascadia Jas

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:39,050
it's almost lunchtime yeah okay so

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,090
that's that's a quick little demo that I

00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,620
put together and actually if I tell it

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,180
to say goodbye right now it's gonna

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,250
explode there's gonna be an error and

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,280
I'm gonna try and live code that before

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,130
lunch so hopefully if demo gods are on

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,780
my side today so that's just some

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,440
JavaScript code that I deployed to a

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,890
lambda function hosted on AWS and it

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,390
just serverless code written in

00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:06,530
JavaScript I'm actually taking advantage

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:09,620
of an NPM package called a SK - SDK

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,390
which is the LX SDK language that's

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,930
actually written in typescript but we're

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,549
not gonna ding him for that so how does

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,260
this actually working when I said

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:20,960
something to the device how did it

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,580
actually parse it I said something which

00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,450
is very different than typing something

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,450
there

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,790
a good analogy for it is Ethernet versus

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,770
Wi-Fi if I connect an ethernet cable to

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,330
my computer I know that the data is

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,830
going from one end of the cable to the

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,990
other end of the cable if I'm connected

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,310
to Wi-Fi I'm transmitting radio signals

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,860
all over the room when they're bouncing

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,770
around that's why the speed on the Wi-Fi

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,620
at home is so crappy but voice is the

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,900
same way if I say something it bounces

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,420
are on this room and then it hits your

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,370
ears and then you do some natural

00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:55,070
language understanding on it and then

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,380
you figure out what I meant to say Alexa

00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,050
works the same way it's got a multiple

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,650
microphones on it and when they say for

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,450
miles

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,870
that's a phonetic spelling spelling for

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,150
for miles you are not too hungry that

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:12,080
your look seeing weird signs it's an

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,850
upside down Omega sign but that could

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,850
mean many things it could mean for

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,610
example for miles and we we parse that

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,960
based on a grammar and a language model

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,810
that I'm going to show you real quick in

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,600
a second and then we turn that into

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:29,060
everyone's favorite JSON so why use

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,120
JavaScript to build Alexa skills because

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,980
we turn all that language into a JSON

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,200
object and there's nothing that's easier

00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,030
to work with than JavaScript and JSON

00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,330
toads it should come very naturally to

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:44,180
you what we do is we turn what the user

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,550
said what we call an utterance into an

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,070
intent what the user meant what was

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,050
their intention and then we pass you a

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,730
JSON object that has the name of the

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,580
intent and might have some variables in

00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,590
there so you can process that so or in

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,770
your code really all that's happening is

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,060
that you're taking some JSON you're

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,820
parsing it you're working with it and

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,160
then you're returning JSON that just

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,390
adheres to our standard and we do all

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,530
the heavy lifting for the voice

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,440
processing the natural language

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:15,320
understanding all these different things

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,320
is that a couple oh if this is a sample

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,930
of a JSON object that would be sent into

00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,970
our code that one for example is in

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,970
Spanish so you'll see there's a tag

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:28,760
called locale and it's es - MX we're

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,710
very proud at Amazon to have support for

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,770
multiple languages I think we're at 15

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,870
right now and one thing to keep in mind

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,750
is you might see in the language

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,150
drop-down when you're

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:43,770
Alexus skill there's multiple English

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:45,090
models and people kind of tend to laugh

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,890
at it when they don't really think

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,630
through it because why do you need an

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,310
English model for Australia and an

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,810
English model for Ireland and an English

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,350
model for the US and an English model

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,810
for the UK beyond the just the acoustic

00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,150
modeling of how we speak we call things

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,610
differently right so in the UK these

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,190
aren't pants right so if I tell someone

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,080
like hey you want to go with me and I'm

00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,150
gonna go pants shopping it might be an

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,880
okay thing to do with my friend but if I

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,850
say that exact same sentence in the UK

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,020
I'm making a different proposition which

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,669
is do you want to come underwear

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,530
shopping with me and it'd have some

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,570
implications right so that's why we need

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,940
multiple language models in the Spanish

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,010
side I don't speak when I'm speaking in

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,050
Spanish like someone from Spain they

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,000
call shoes that I'm very fond off

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,760
sopla tedious that is what we call

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,470
ballet shoes in Mexico I would never say

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,550
that I'm into ballet shoes cuz I just

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:40,290
know I'm just not so it's it just Forks

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,850
and it grows and grows and grows so it's

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,650
really important to have these multiple

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,690
language models so we can capture input

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,430
accurately and the name of the game when

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:51,450
it comes to voice is accuracy and

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,430
context so this is describing the first

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,740
flow at the top there's a bunch of

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,270
different really complicated math and

00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,680
compute it compute that's happening in

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,140
there the good news is you don't need to

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,970
do it it's a bit of a black box but it's

00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,100
a toolbox for you that we already built

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,660
completely free to use what we use is

00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,350
speech recognition so we're trying to

00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,390
turn the audio that we got into text

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:15,479
then use machine learning and natural

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,460
language or understanding to understand

00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,440
the meaning of that text reading so if

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,580
you said blue do you mean the color blue

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,950
blue or the verb blue and it kind of

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,570
balloons out of there on the right side

00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:31,979
there's just some JavaScript code and

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:34,080
it's all just working with JSON on the

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:36,630
flip side so if you're going on the from

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,409
the back we're returning a response and

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:42,780
we're saying the output speech is okay

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,300
and the type is SS ml and we're get

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,790
we'll get to SS ml in a second ss ml

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,089
stands for speech synthesis markup

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,939
language you can think of it all

00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:54,769
most like CSS for voice so when you

00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:57,589
heard Alexis say YUM

00:08:54,769 --> 00:09:00,620
it put a bunch of emphasis into that I'm

00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:04,970
using SSM l to markup my speech when I'm

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:07,449
returning it to to our ears basically so

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,399
what it's doing here is gonna take that

00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:13,970
object find what the actual output

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:17,269
speeches and then it'll say it and again

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,860
that's a phonetic spelling for okay and

00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:21,649
that's what we'll hear and then

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,410
hopefully we'll try to our human brain

00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:26,930
will parse it properly

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:31,670
so just final reminder of last time

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:34,420
we'll see this guy and it's that

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:38,449
everything that's happening at our

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:40,220
communicating with our service is JSON

00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:43,189
and all our code is JavaScript

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,509
it's ghosted on AWS for in my case using

00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:47,420
serverless technology which is lambda

00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:49,399
but you could build an HTTP server or if

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,069
you already have an HTTP server and just

00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:54,769
direct the traffic there do all your

00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:57,860
processing there send it back there's no

00:09:54,769 --> 00:10:00,920
real language requirement we just love

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,629
javascript and we've built this amazing

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,040
as a kay but we also have a bunch of

00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:05,569
samples out there and all these

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,459
documentation specifically for

00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:10,189
javascript so it should be very easy for

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:12,860
you guys and gals to get started today

00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:14,689
so I'm not gonna bore you too much with

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:18,319
that I just want to talk a little bit

00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:20,569
how you build one of these and like any

00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:23,899
other piece of software it's gonna have

00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:26,839
a user interface and a programming logic

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:29,899
so a front end and a back end except the

00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,029
front end is like ear end and voice end

00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:33,679
right because what you're saying what

00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:36,800
you're hearing and the programming logic

00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,179
is just gonna be some code in the

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,600
specific demo that I'm gonna do I'm

00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,999
gonna build all my voice UI using

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,889
developer amazon.com and then I'm going

00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:51,139
to close my logic in AWS quick quick

00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:52,999
quick reminder what we're going to be

00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:53,870
doing when we're building a voice UI and

00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:56,329
I'm going to show you one that's

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,540
pre-made is we're gonna take uh pterence

00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:02,089
is the different ways someone speaks and

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,970
then map those to an intent the intent

00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:06,370
is just a flag then I then

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:10,930
look at in my code and say based on this

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:12,610
event I want to run this code but it's

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,740
what we're doing is we're training a

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:18,370
system we're using artificial

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:21,370
intelligence ml natural language or

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,529
understanding so I put a bunch of

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,920
utterances into a funnel and those get

00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:28,870
turned into an intent and then in my

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,410
code I'm going to actually handle those

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:36,399
and I'll go walk line by line through

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:39,069
this code in a second but you got to

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,100
remember most important thing probably

00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:44,529
out of this whole talk is garbage in

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,949
garbage out so you're training a model

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:50,050
if you put in a bunch of useless

00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:51,699
training data it's gonna behave wildly

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,279
and erratically and do all these things

00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:55,779
that you don't actually want it to do so

00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,879
you got to be really mindful of what

00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:59,920
you're training your model to do when

00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:02,290
you're training the model you're not

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,949
building you're not creating an array or

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:08,110
an enumeration of sentences that the

00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:11,079
user can say you're giving an array or

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,569
an enumeration of sentences to a machine

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,540
and it's going to try to build a grammar

00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:17,829
and a language model out of that so be

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,720
really careful about what you what

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:21,579
you're doing if all your sentences end

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,009
in the word please what you're teaching

00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:26,230
the model is to look for sentences that

00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:28,120
end in the word please so variety

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,059
looking for different adjectives

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,259
different verbs talking in plural

00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:33,879
there's a singular that one I learned

00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:39,660
from my mom because she kept breaking my

00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:43,480
skills so I'm gonna do a quick demo and

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm gonna show you what I built to do

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:51,250
that really really basic skill that I

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:57,939
showed you and of course I'm logged out

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:59,379
and what easy fix okay so what I did is

00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:02,500
I created an intent that was called

00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:05,649
called begin intent in a skill called

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,079
Cascadia Jas I actually ran into an

00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:10,029
issue because Cascadia Jas is hard to

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,769
say it's a made-up word so I have to

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:14,139
split up into Cascadia which I didn't

00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:16,959
have any issues capturing and then Jas I

00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:17,360
did it two ways Jas has two letters and

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,149
the

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,820
jas as an initialism which is je period

00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:24,680
s period FBI is an initialism it's not

00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,079
really an acronym an acronym is when you

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,779
can say the word aloud and of course I'm

00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:31,339
blanking out right now oh yeah NASA NASA

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:34,850
is a good one thank you

00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:39,100
so in this case I did it both ways this

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:41,360
should be just but it still works and

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,690
what I did is I created these utterances

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,180
for this utterance and they're all get

00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,320
started let's get started to start begin

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,640
my talk start my talk they all have this

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,970
they're conveying the message if I want

00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,040
to get going and I could add a ton more

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,019
of a variety here what you have to be

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,970
mindful of is if you have multiple

00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:04,519
intents you have to think of them as a

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,399
Venn diagram this should an overlap when

00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,230
you're making a website or an app you

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,880
would never put two buttons that kind of

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,779
overlap and then the user clicks on it

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,980
you like I don't know what's gonna

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:18,260
happen exciting it's the same thing for

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,029
voice if you put the same utterance in

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,589
to intents you're gonna confuse the

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,690
model it's not gonna really know what to

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:26,269
do so it's gonna behave erratically I

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,670
also made a goodbye intent and a half

00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:30,740
bye-bye goodbye say goodbye say bye in

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,089
there let me demo that real quick and

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,160
it'll just be an error because I haven't

00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:35,050
created the code to handle it and we're

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,300
gonna do that right now

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:44,029
Alexa tell Cascadia jay has to say

00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:46,220
goodbye sorry an error occurred so that

00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:47,449
just my my back-end code saying like I

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,610
don't know how to handle this I got an

00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:56,470
intent and I don't know what sorry with

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:59,120
it an error occurred Alexa stop goodbye

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,459
so it's it just it would have been just

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,350
cycle there with that error so what I'm

00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:06,800
gonna do is go to my a Tobias console

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:10,339
and all I have here is just a lambda

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,620
function that has a trigger set up for

00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:14,630
Alexa skills kit and has a dependency on

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,770
the SDK so let me show you that real

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,950
quick

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,950
[Music]

00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:30,890
designer so this is just the AWS AWS

00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:33,170
lambda console here I'm saying

00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:35,060
it can take Alexa skills kit event to

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,380
trigger my code since it's server less

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,300
it doesn't mean it doesn't use a server

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,740
it just means that me as a lazy

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,090
developer I don't have to think about

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,650
the server I don't care if it's a

00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,660
Windows box or a Linux box sort of

00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,220
someone harden it or if there is a load

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,080
balancer in front of it it just does all

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,190
that magically for me which is great

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,310
because I don't want to spend my time

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:56,660
doing that and then looking at my code

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:58,550
really quickly you'll notice that I have

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:03,110
a few handlers they have a begin Handler

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:04,790
I have a help Handler and I have an

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,580
error handler and that's where we're

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,050
saying sorry and error occurred but I

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,870
don't have a handler for the other

00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,310
intent that I created which is the let

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:18,700
me refresh this page to make sure that

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:21,200
my changes will actually do something I

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,600
don't have a handler for the goodbye

00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,660
intent so it that's why just throwing an

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,740
error I'm gonna create that intent real

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:36,260
quickly and what we have here is I'm

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:38,330
just gonna steal my own code and turn

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:46,250
this begin handler into a goodbye

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:50,090
handler by content handler and what I'm

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,770
doing is this handler has two functions

00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,600
in it when it's can't handle and the

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,820
other one is handle they both take a

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,490
handler input as a parameter and that

00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:01,990
parameter contains a whole request that

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:05,150
we were sent from the Alexa service and

00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:07,370
all I have to do is return true to the

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,709
event that I want to respond to so

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,320
instead I'm saying request type intent

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,970
request and then instead of begin intent

00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,630
I'm going to change it to be goodbye

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:19,100
intent and I've known from doing a lot

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,170
of live demos that you should never type

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,480
copy and paste as your friend and then

00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,600
the response here instead of being high

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,170
Cascadia j/s blah blah blah I'm gonna

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,170
just say

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:37,940
enjoy your lunch and then punctuation

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,980
spelling all those things really matter

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,520
here because if I screw it up it's gonna

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,380
say in or if I forget that my I'm

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,120
sending a response back that it's

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,800
supposed to be in Spanish and I type it

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,750
in English it's gonna try to parse all

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,210
those letters as Spanish and I'll be

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,510
Spanglish and it'll be hilarious but not

00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:58,490
very helpful so now I'm just gonna save

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,740
that instance all deployed to the cloud

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:06,020
I can just immediately test it Alexa

00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:11,870
tell Cascadia j/s to say goodbye sorry

00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:14,630
an error occurred so this is where you

00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:20,420
pull your parish an error occurs Alexa

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:24,140
stop and an error occurred so apparently

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:28,460
it broke everything what I'm going to do

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:34,970
is just show you from the simulator and

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:36,620
we can do a quick debug Cascadia J yes

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,120
so this is the simulator allows it to

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:42,310
type in things that we could also say

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:46,990
and of course nothing is working now

00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,990
this is no one's fault but myself

00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,900
that was a comma

00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:02,130
okay here we go so once we see this in

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,140
the simulator we have the JSON object

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:07,770
that's going into my service on the left

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,690
and the response on the right and you'll

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,140
see that here's the one since I just

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:16,380
said open it's giving me that welcome

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:19,860
message but if I say open Cascadia j/s

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:27,600
and say goodbye we should get an error

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:30,270
that we can debug with so I have this

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,730
event and I can take this whole event go

00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:37,200
back to my lambda function and configure

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:41,460
a test event here I'm gonna create a new

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:44,429
event gonna call it error and then I'm

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,820
gonna replace it there and I'm gonna

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:49,620
pass in this error this event into my

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,150
lambda function by passing the Alexa

00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,010
service so I'm kind of spoofing it but

00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,840
since it's my own account it's secure

00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,510
and I can actually do that then I'm

00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,970
gonna click test and I think I already

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:02,669
know my error which is my error that I

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,740
always make which is handler chain on

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,110
found yep

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,640
handler chain on phone so what I did is

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,380
I created the handler but I never

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:16,520
registered it so it doesn't know there's

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:16,520
a handler for it so I'm going to

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,330
register that handler this is what

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,250
happens in your live code copy that

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:29,669
handler and then down here at the bottom

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:33,480
with the actual SDK I just register that

00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:35,580
I'm gonna save and test and now we

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,280
should just see that enjoy your lunch

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,600
message so it works I'm gonna wait wait

00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,950
a second for Alexa to come back because

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,220
I unplugged her because he was looped

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,480
and we'll test that in the meantime now

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,610
that we've done with our demo and got

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,090
four minutes I just wanted to leave you

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:52,950
with some design notes about voice so a

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,049
few thoughts on design the first one is

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,240
friction is the enemy any time I'm doing

00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:59,190
anything with voice I'm probably like

00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,970
that awesome lady just hanging out on a

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:05,470
hammock by a cactus reading a book

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,110
but uh but what I don't want to do is

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:10,060
get up and touch something or find my

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,220
phone or whatever like I just want to be

00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,920
able to say thing so if it doesn't pass

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,740
the couch test it's not good it's not

00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,350
probably a good use case for a voice we

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,870
also don't talk the way we write just

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:26,950
ask your English teacher from twelfth

00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:28,690
grade so anytime you type in something

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,820
that the user needs to say or that

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,500
Alexa's gonna reply just say it out loud

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,150
you'll be surprised at how good we're at

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,170
tongue twisters but you read them and

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,790
they're like that makes perfect sense

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,130
I'm an incredible writer where's my

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,750
where's my Oscar

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,840
the other one is follow the brought the

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,620
one breath rule if you're sending some

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,420
response back and it takes longer than a

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,640
breath to read out it's too much

00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,990
information voice has a problem or a

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,120
it's not a problem it just a

00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,340
characteristic which is it required it

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,200
has a high cognitive load and what that

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,180
means is we have to pay attention to

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,010
what the device is saying we can't

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,600
multitask with voice you couldn't

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,430
pretend that you're watching a movie and

00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,870
also listening to a conversation but you

00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,360
quickly context with Jing and you're

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,010
probably getting 70% of one and thirty

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,270
percent of the other so if we're giving

00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,670
the user options and they're only

00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:19,360
getting 30% of it it's gonna be bad so

00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,220
be brief and don't talk at people talk

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,800
to people you know we want to model

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:27,610
something as a real conversation between

00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:29,440
humans variety is your friend so every

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,150
time you call your bank or your airline

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,370
you get the exact same prompts in the

00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:36,070
exact same monotone voice that is

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,560
incredibly boring that's also not how we

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:41,170
talk with humans so after have some

00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,660
spice in there use SS ml say YUM when

00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,850
you're ending your message it makes it

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,940
stickier it makes it memorable if it's

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:51,160
Monday say happy Monday or if it's

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,450
Thursday say it's almost Friday I don't

00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,370
know just make it a little bit more

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,740
interesting designed for the situation

00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,960
you can break down any step in a

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,030
conversation into four things the

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,980
utterance so what the user said what the

00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,810
situation they're in is the first time

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,670
I've ever seen them is there's a 100th

00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,990
time they saw I saw them where they in

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,240
the middle of the game last time they

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,220
talked to me and then what response on

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,020
them I'm gonna send them and what prompt

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,090
or what question am I gonna ask them you

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,010
can break down every single interaction

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,220
to this and then you can make awesome

00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:24,330
little cards with those and start

00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:27,039
storyboarding with them diagrams or

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,659
flowcharts are not a good way to design

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,179
a voice conversation because the user

00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:33,130
can say anything whenever they want if I

00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:35,230
call a travel agent I can and they ask

00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,610
me where do you want to go I can say I

00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,929
want to go tomorrow and they're not

00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,710
gonna hang up on me and be like nope

00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:43,150
wrong answer

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:46,450
so your skills should work the same way

00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:49,750
it should be really really freeing again

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:52,299
friction is the enemy that is it for me

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:57,390
I just want to let Alexis say goodbye

00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:57,390
Alexa tell Cascadia Jas to say goodbye

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,770
sorry I'm not sure that fun thank you so

00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,170
much it was an absolute pleasure

00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,170
[Applause]

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:18,520
all right bear with us for just one or

00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:24,070
two minutes while we do little laptops

00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:25,600
which I know oh by the way while I have

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,210
your attention for a couple a couple

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,510
moments I'll just go ahead and admit

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:33,850
that I can ask more specific and better

00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:36,400
questions when trying to plan lunches

00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:39,160
that is a betterment that we can do for

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,440
next year I would I do want to say

00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,900
though if you did not specifically

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,220
specify a dietary restriction of

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:50,080
vegetarian or vegan please abstain from

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,540
those items when you go grab lunch I

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,160
know they're all delicious but planning

00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,960
is tough and we just want to make sure

00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,220
that there are enough vegetarian and

00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,240
vegan options for the people who need

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:03,460
them but here we are and I wanted to

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,170
take a couple minutes to talk about the

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,440
closing party that we're having tonight

00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:12,640
and the best person to kind of share

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,650
this event with you is Heidi Larsen one

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,890
of the co-organizers of Cascadia and

00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,180
more or less the brainchild of the event

00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:26,290
we have tonight so I'm going to turn it

00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:27,850
over to Heidi hello hey I'm really

00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:30,160
excited to hang out with you all at the

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:32,440
living computer museum tonight and if

00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,610
you're not excited yet let me tell you a

00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,370
little bit more about it because the

00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,990
name doesn't communicate a lot it's a

00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,930
computer museum because it has the

00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:43,510
largest collection of mainframes super

00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:46,060
macro mini computers in the world and

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:48,940
it's living because they all work and

00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,200
you can use them so if you're not

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,170
excited yet

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,630
that's just upstairs Downstairs is all

00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:59,020
the modern tech so interactive exhibits

00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:01,300
with AI VR big data there's a

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,190
self-driving car there's digital art

00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,470
there's video game making I'm forgetting

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,060
stuff anyway it's gonna be really great

00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,930

worked really hard give her a round of

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,320
applause yeah this event is absolutely

gonna be amazing
