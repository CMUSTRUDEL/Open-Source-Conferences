Title: Down the Rabbit Hole with WebVR    Shannon Foster    CascadiaJS 2018
Publication date: 2018-12-04
Playlist: CascadiaJS 2018
Description: 
	The evolution of user interactivity on the web has birthed the growing advancements of web innovation and creativity. Pushing developers and designers to look for unique ways to engage and immerse our users. From utilizing AR in online retail to show what products would physically look like either in a living space or on the users themselves, to banking in VR where low-poly animations are used to teach money management. Let's explore available VR tools, from A-Frame and beyond, and different use cases for developing in VR for the web.

hi guys how are you can you hear me well

00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:10,050
awesome okay so my name is Shannon

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:14,280
Foster I'm from Baltimore Maryland I'm a

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,929
techie and I got invited to do Cascadia

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,640
only a few weeks ago so I'm really

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,470
excited to kind of be like the

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,900
last-minute speaker but also kind of

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,910
show you guys some of the things that I

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,490
hope that you can learn from this talk

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,650
as far as web PR goes from a show of

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,669
hands has anyone doesn't work with web

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,250
PR before I see like five people

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:38,670
okay that's still cool has anyone used

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,540
VR in general before headset oculus rift

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,520
daydream cardboard okay alright so it's

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,370
a good group of people and a good

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,170
dynamic I would say so with this talk as

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,570
I mentioned before kind of want to give

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,000
you guys a deep dive kind of a little

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,590
bit of an overview of what is happening

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,239
and what can be done what whether you

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,829
are a little bit beyond the scope of

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:05,369
gaming but more so per se you know

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,430
shopping or maybe even banking in VR or

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,890
AR and so upon creation of this talk I

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,130
realized that there was an error in my

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,320
talk title so instead of it being down

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,619
the rabbit hole with VR it should say

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,390
something else but I'll dive into that a

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:29,880
little bit later as we go through this

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:33,060
talk here yeah sorry give me one moment

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,960
here okay yeah so web VR sparked my

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,140
interest at go IO 2017 it was this new

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,890
thing that browsers are trying to adopt

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,240
and get started with not too many people

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,810
still know the difference between

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,909
regular VR and web VR and who can blame

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,320
them it's you know kind of the not

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,549
really the same title but when you hear

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,250
web PR you're just kind of like okay

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,930
what big differences can this be exactly

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,479
you know what exactly can I do with this

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,119
that I can't do already primarily with

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,710
the hardware device and so I'm hoping I

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,909
can show you that difference here so

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,909
let's take a look at a few examples

00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:18,510
see if I can get this to play okay cool

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,510
so see it's playing oh there we go so

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,550
this is if you guys have heard of the

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:26,820
awards this is one of the nominees for

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,760
the best web be our example sites

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:33,300
I'm created by this guy called a cubic

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,760
photo cubed a German developer and a

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,770
group of designers this really stood out

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,610
to me one because it's not just a game

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:43,740
but the interactivity along with this

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:48,690
just looks really cool and if you look

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,730
here yeah and when you look away when

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,790
the user looks away or pulls away from

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,220
the view and the scene it has some sort

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,230
of timer or math going on here where it

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:02,010
knows like okay users looking away head

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,600
his turn turn back game interacts or

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,070
this component interacts so that's just

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,390
something that stood out and this was

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:11,280
tagged with three Jas WebGL Babylon and

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,540
a few other things and I just thought

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,290
I'd show you guys so another example

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:21,630
this is also another awards one that we

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,959
have going on here and this one was more

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,610
so if you've ever been to they have

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,290
these new things called AR art art

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,140
exhibits we have this thing

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,300
ar Tech or something in DC where it's a

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,100
nightclub and you can you know have a

00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,810
little martinis and use your phone to

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,209
see like the AR pop up on the martini

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,980
and so this is a photo gallery and it's

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,180
in virtual reality and this is me

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,030
scrolling through it through the browser

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,650
of course and this person created it as

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,330
a portfolio and I just thought it was a

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,610
good way to kind of show you guys like

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,519
how we're stepping through into the

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:58,820
mercy of Technology on the browser and

00:03:52,519 --> 00:04:02,430
you know just what we can do with it and

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,080
the cool thing about this is the user as

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,360
you can see I'm obviously not using a

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,820
headset I'm using my laptop to access

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,760
this the cool thing about web PR is all

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:15,150
you need is a URL to get access to this

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,650
game or portfolio or design or anything

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,609
like that you don't need

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:23,010
fairly a overpriced or over expensive

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:26,100
oculus rift or HTC vive just to

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,800
experience this anyone can do it which

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,220
is why I love the inclusivity of web

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,590
they are another one just a showroom

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,040
example if you've ever used like an IKEA

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,690
app or oh gosh there's another one

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,169
that's also a furniture store app where

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,419
you can place place things in the room

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:47,460
and furniture or even Amazon now when

00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,320
you shop on there you can use it with

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,030
reality to kind of see what things look

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,530
like in your actual space and so for

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,630
instance this is just another example

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,240
that just shows like this is a showroom

00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,280
that you can see online of course just

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,530
type in the URL and just kind of tour

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,870
the area and something that really stood

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,970
out to me is you can click on each of

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,979
these 3d objects that are placed here

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:12,030
and the user can decide which types of

00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,350
textures that they want to add to the

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,199
object which I thought was pretty neat

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,820
using these different spheres so if you

00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:22,200
want to test it out there is a link

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,320
right there on the bottom and just one

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,070
more this one I grabbed off of Google

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,979
experiences they demoed this last year

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:33,360
at Google i/o 2017 and again it's just

00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:36,630
like the whole introduction to just

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,300
using web BR and this one this one's

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,099
actually really funny because it just

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,870
kind of dives into why there was an

00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:45,210
error in the way that I named my talk

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,349
and why there's any need for me to

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,349
rename it so

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:04,180
get excited ready to start and play this

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:07,240
game and then suddenly it tells me like

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,330
hey by the way like we're no longer

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,900
using what BR we're moving over to web X

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:16,449
R and so that's where the area's error

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,850
is in my talk I miss name this talk

00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:21,880
completely so I decided I'm gonna change

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,699
it to down the rabbit hole with Webre R

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:33,100
or V R on the web sorry

00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:36,460
and so turns out the web BR version 1.1

00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,139
is deprecated there's only a few

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,750
browsers that still use it and you can

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,729
probably guess which ones are the late

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:47,080
bloomers that probably still use it

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:49,060
maybe per se but you can if necessary

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,030
absolutely necessary you can go back

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,610
through the API list or documentation

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,289
and see you know okay I want to use the

00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,280
specific version of this and try it out

00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:02,410
great it hasn't gone obviously very far

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,450
it's still something if you want worth

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,820
looking at but it's been replaced by the

00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:09,250
webex our device API which I'll dive a

00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,360
little bit into a little bit later and

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,120
as I mentioned before currently

00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,340
available on some browsers web PR of

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,410
course is an experiment and of and of

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,120
itself as we have so many different

00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:24,250
groups trying to work and develop their

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:27,419
own standards of it and just see how far

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:29,800
can we go with this technology and so

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:33,280
there are multiple iterations that it's

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,099
going through we also have open XR which

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,690
is not really competing but they're also

00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:42,370
trying to develop this new standard of

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:44,590
again web VR on the web and so they're

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,110
the open source community and major web

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,820
browsers are allowing all different

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,330
types of work for the web we are in a

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:55,139
full web standard as I said before oops

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,139
too far

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:09,009
and if this gives me back my mouse

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:11,590
that'd be great okay so anyways so when

00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:14,259
you try to open up a web browser

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,440
web VR applications that are using this

00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:18,909
API that has been deprecated the user

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,409
will usually get this error at the very

00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:23,650
top of their screen so they can't really

00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:25,509
do much I know disappointment so it's

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:29,219
currently this is what they'll get with

00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:31,719
Chrome the developer model as well as a

00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:34,360
coronary and as well as the Samsung

00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:37,029
Internet and a few others I know with

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,640
Safari any Apple device mostly because

00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:42,300
I'm positive they don't support most of

00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,640
the web VR features they're mostly with

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,680
what is it AR core I think is the way

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,910
that they're going and so that's why you

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,279
probably won't see a lot of support or

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,800
and or don't get this error message and

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,589
as far as those that still support it

00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,200
they'll also be able one to use the

00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,970
application and they'll also get this at

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,310
the very top of it and the VR displays

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:07,029
not found it's just a function that we

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,740
can go ahead and input into our system

00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,779
that displays a little icon that says

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,000
okay here you go you can use the VR

00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:17,560
functionality for your device or the

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,010
supported device and of course we're

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:24,610
Internet Explorer when trying to use

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:26,980
what VR they're gonna get either a blank

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,170
white screen or a blank black screen so

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,110
I don't know why they're always so

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:38,500
behind but be cool if one day it can

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:40,120
catch up all right so that brings a new

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,480
talk title I guess down the rabbit hole

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:49,029
with WebEx are and let's just dive more

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:51,250
into exactly what is WebEx are so WebEx

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:54,579
are can be called by many different

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,699
names from extended reality to cross

00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:59,860
reality but according to those who are

00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:03,220
the main contributors to the device API

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,530
for WebEx are they want X to mean

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,370
something else

00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:10,350
ideally it's whatever whatever you guys

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,570
want it to be think of it as a variable

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,700
of sorts

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:20,580
whatever you create this can be the

00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:24,600
definition of that so it's open source

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:27,690
API of course as I mentioned before it's

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,250
currently in an experiment as I

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,830
mentioned earlier we're testing out the

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,750
limitations on what we can do with what

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,280
we are how far can we actually go with

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,900
this technology and what can be done

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,970
what are the different use cases I

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,590
mentioned earlier that a few of us are

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,680
trying banking and augmented reality

00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,510
where we have your card and you just

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,580
hover your phone over it your camera

00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,260
just pops out with a graph interactive

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,520
graph of you know this is your spending

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,220
habits this is how much you spent this

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,750
money your limits this is what you went

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,250
over this is your goal things like that

00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,310
just to teach people better spending

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,050
habits as well as shopping in augmented

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,770
reality we're also trying to disrupt the

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:07,020
fashion industry last year also at

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:10,380
Google i/o they introduced this new gap

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:15,000
augmented reality application where you

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:17,010
can see the textile and the 3d object of

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,740
the model or whoever wearing this

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,270
clothing pattern and you can interact

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,850
with it change the different sizes of it

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,650
and you can do it in browser as well to

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,570
make it much more accessible to all

00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,850
users versus those who just have to have

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,350
a specific type of phone I can remember

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,960
the phone that they tried to pass with

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,540
the last year just to get that

00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:41,760
application going it was a Verizon thing

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:45,810
I don't know but uh yeah and it also

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,750
simplifies creating on VR and x vr XR AR

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,880
applications on the web for any

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,880
supported hardware device so whether

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,300
it's a Google daydream cardboard vibe

00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:00,240
rift this simplifies that by allowing

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:04,620
developers to have easier access versus

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:08,280
using or manually inputting OpenGL or

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,810
yeah OpenGL WebGL or whichever to get

00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,150
this going so this just makes life

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:15,000
easier for all of us

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:17,850
of course it's not open X are so open X

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,980
are is you can I guess you can consider

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,070
it a competitor and a competitor in a

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,900
way except none of these companies are

00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,010
well groups are they're open sourced and

00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:30,600
they're not making it to it some money

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:32,370
so open XR is another API that's created

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,040
by the Khronos group which was

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,890
previously called the Kronos VR

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,700
initiative and that's basically a group

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:45,690
of engineers from Google Pluto I think

00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:48,750
also oculus that are pretty much the

00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:51,300
same people who also work on the WebEx

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,410
our platform and they're all just again

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,750
we're all just trying to work together

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,490
and develop these new standards for this

00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:00,210
technology and to see how far we can go

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:02,310
so this is an example of one of the

00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:05,760
first applications or mobile

00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:11,640
applications that's using WebEx our if I

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:13,410
can get back to play and so yeah there

00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,120
was one of the first organizations that

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,130
are actually getting this going and

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,680
they're actually using the WebEx R as a

00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,890
platform to help developers I believe

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,890
like you to build augmented reality apps

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:28,980
and XR if it's big enough

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:35,190
I'd have to I'm scared I might break

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:38,340
something and so they're just tracing 3d

00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:41,330
objects with an interactive menu and

00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:44,660
it's all again using that WebEx our

00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,660
device API

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,710
okay so one of the things with though

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,590
again the WebEx our API is you can

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,600
detect query whole display and what this

00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,190
means is that it enables XR applications

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,840
on the web by lying pages to do the

00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,740
following again detect query poll

00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,320
display

00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,540
detective capabilities are available

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,990
query the XR capabilities poll the XR

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:24,370
display and associated input device date

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:27,940
on display imagery and on the XR device

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:30,760
at the appropriate framerate and some of

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,590
the goals I guess these are primarily

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,720
the goals of what they're hoping to do

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,490
with this API and I know that some of

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,740
the non goals they've made that very

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,360
clear is defined how virtual reality is

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,790
to not define how virtual reality on

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,330
what reality works on the browser and to

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:49,540
expose every feature every feature or

00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:52,870
every piece of VR and AR hardware to not

00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,640
sorry and to not build the Metaverse I

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,150
would hope they're not exposing anything

00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:02,070
on the hardware and so this is just

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:05,410
another example of another experiment

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:07,840
using a XR device API

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:11,260
um this is primarily for iOS but I

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,420
clearly have an Android so it works on

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:19,000
here so let's see if I can play this

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:20,980
example and so this is just again it's

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,500
just showing what you can do with this

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,290
API and I can show you guys a link in a

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,550
second on how to get access to this and

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,380
it's just an experiment of just like

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,700
trying it out and just see okay cool

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,590
we're just building doing this building

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,590
block game what else can we do with this

00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:51,420
oh yeah this is the one this is sorry I

00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,840
work at a cybersecurity firm so it's

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,880
this is the one that's like hey you can

00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,320
access the site but anything if I go

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,320
back to the slide here

00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,770
okay all right so again one of the

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,590
things I mentioned earlier is what's the

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,180
difference between what VR and VR one of

00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:19,260
the main difference is virtual reality

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:21,800
is something that we can well use to be

00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,630
able to just maintain or keep within

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:29,339
hardware devices so only those who had

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:32,220
access to VR or even sometimes AR it's

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,740
just if they had these very expensive

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,080
hardware devices so one of the benefits

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,240
and beauties of web VR is that we can

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,100
make it accessible and inclusive for a

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,529
lot of different people to use it and

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,060
it's a good way to think about it

00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:47,310
another way to think about it is that we

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,950
can scale our applications you know from

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,390
being these basic ecommerce site to

00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,089
something where the user can actually

00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:56,010
look at the item this 3d model spin it

00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:57,900
around and even walk around it and just

00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,160
see like okay is this something that

00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,240
actually went in my home is this

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,390
something that actually wouldn't wear

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,160
you know the browser in my opinion it's

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,280
getting a little websites are getting a

00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,920
little boring nowadays and I feel like

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,120
there are just so many different

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,829
interfaces that we can add more

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,100
interactivity that we can have that

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:19,140
keeps a user engaged and coming back to

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,449
our sites for more one of the companies

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,510
I used to work for Under Armour we

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:30,030
didn't enable 360 view of our sneakers I

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:31,590
think until 2016 I believe and even then

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,660
it's still not enough for the youth for

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,570
our customers they call us and they ask

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,460
us hey like what what what's the exact

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,990
color of this because sometimes the you

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,300
know colors are off or what's the exact

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,890
material this or you know what does this

00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,080
feel and look like and in some cases

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,900
unfortunately for us we can't really

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,150
explain it though you know we work there

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,800
we still don't technically violate them

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,150
even if you work in underwear you don't

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,830
really buy the shoes to be honest with

00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:59,880
you so it was just really hard to you

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,350
know it's just really hard to explain

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,540
you know what this material would look

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,300
like for the customer and so imagine

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:09,450
this if we have this VR application or

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,950
even an AR again they can look at it and

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,590
technically not feel it or smell it

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,450
that'd be kind of weird but still they

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,820
can just see like okay this is what this

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,409
product looked like looks like

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,750
okay yes this product can definitely be

00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:21,860
for me just the way to consider it and

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,860
there are companies that are doing that

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:28,610
I can link you a few later on and so

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:31,070
just to dive into again with Web VR we

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,269
have usually if you're on YouTube on

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,309
your mobile device you'll see this

00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:36,080
little icon in the corner that says okay

00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,549
do you want to watch this video in

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,740
virtual reality and then you'll get

00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,509
these two little lens that will not lens

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,889
will screen that pop up that are split

00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:45,019
but they're showing the same exact

00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:47,000
content for when you put the ear headset

00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:50,720
on and then of course what VR it's the

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,179
same thing except I mean you can use the

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,850
st. the same exact devices for viewing

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,220
web PR and so the idea of the future of

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:01,009
web VR is that we can browse the web or

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,159
browse the anything really using these

00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:07,279
same exact devices but the best way in

00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:09,679
my opinion to do this is to just either

00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,840
have the option to yes you can use the

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,519
hardware device or no you can just use

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,080
your phone or the browser to get this

00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:20,539
done and just to dive a little bit into

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,519
WebGL because I figured okay hey yeah

00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:25,909
sure let's go ahead and touch base on

00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:27,649
this just a little bit so WebGL is

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:29,750
basically what I described is just

00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:34,190
simply oh dear god that's cutting up

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:37,220
it's just the canvas canvas we're just

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:41,000
building 2d and 3d graphics the great

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:44,750
thing about today's available libraries

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,129
of just frameworks is that you don't

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,100
necessarily have to do this you don't

00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:52,429
have to manually go in and type all of

00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,049
this obnoxiousness and in your HTML

00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:57,019
because there's something that's already

00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:58,639
there that does this for you I'm just

00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:02,590
gonna I mean if you guys want to see it

00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:02,590
I can show you this later but there's

00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:17,950
oh wait to far okay okay yeah so I guess

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,200
that cut down to the last one weird but

00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,720

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,300
web VR is something I've been doing for

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,540
the last year and a half or technically

00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,850
after the launch of I would say Pokemon

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,010
go is when I got into augmented reality

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,690
I was like yeah I gotta try this out

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,680
but anyway it's feel free to reach out
