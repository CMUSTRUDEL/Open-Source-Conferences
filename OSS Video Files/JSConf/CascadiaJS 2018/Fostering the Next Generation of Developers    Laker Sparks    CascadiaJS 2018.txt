Title: Fostering the Next Generation of Developers    Laker Sparks    CascadiaJS 2018
Publication date: 2018-12-10
Playlist: CascadiaJS 2018
Description: 
	When you hear about a development studio, you may typically think about a group of industry experts with years of experience and education. But there is a new generation of emerging developers who are not content to wait for college, or even high school to get in the game. As the head of Information Experience on Roblox, Laker Sparks has seen young hobbyist programmers transform into multi-million dollar development teams. In this talk, he will share his learnings and observations about the experiences and challenges of these young developers, and then discuss resources and techniques you can use to help foster this next generation of developers and creators.

thank you very much and sorry about that

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,450
setup I have like the least technical

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,280
presentation today so of course I had

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,800
the most technical problems getting my

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,719
computer working so you know I tried to

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,639
make it nice and easy but you just you

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,060
know technology I love it and I also

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,539
hate it so yeah so alright I have this

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,619
thing

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,660
it makes the slides go big secret so

00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:26,279
yeah so my name is Laker and I'm gonna

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,289
be talking to you about some of the work

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,599
that I do with young developers on our

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,300
platform but really I think that it

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,800
extends to all development and really to

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,820
pretty much almost any industry if you

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,989
really really think about it

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,300
my magical button things don't work and

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,680
so I'll just be over here and so just to

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,149
give you kind of a little roadmap of

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,280
what we're gonna do today I'm just gonna

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,730
give you a little bit of a who is this

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,500
guy

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,239
gonna talk about some of our developers

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,730
talk about some of our experiences

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,050
working with them and then last I'm

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,610
gonna wrap it up and kind of talk about

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,300
you know maybe what you can do with your

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,340
community and some people that you know

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,619
so to start off my name is Laker

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,200
I am always hesitant to give out my

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,909
title as we saw the manager of

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,670
information experience no one knows that

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,530
what that means that's okay my title

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,450
changes all the time basically the gist

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,460
of it is that I teach kids how to make

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,259
games that's really the long and short

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,060
of it I started as a full-stack engineer

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,189
but then realized you know I'd rather

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,350
teach people how to code than to do it

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,450
myself all the time love coding but only

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,360
in small pieces or rather teach people

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,590
how to do it and the company I work for

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,329
is called roblox

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,329
maybe you've heard of it maybe you

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,340
haven't the trick is if you have someone

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,650
young in your life like a nephew niece

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,869
son daughter chances are they might have

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,299
heard of this yeah we're a gaming

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,740
platform it's primarily aimed at kids

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,439
although we like to think that we're for

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,110
all ages and the beauty of our platform

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,590
is that we try to take all the heavy

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,180
work out of doing making games I'm not

00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,950
sure how familiar all of you are with

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,299
game development there's a lot of things

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,110
are just a real pain in the butt

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,060
things like networking physics you know

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,610
just managing servers so much of that

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,289
just gets in the way of starting up a

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,849
new game starting up a new project and

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,160
we just realized you know what why don't

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,720
we just do

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,420
all that work for people so that they

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,580
can just focus on the gameplay focus on

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,290
the experience and what's really nice

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,640
about that is that because we take all

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,080
those little technical aspects that you

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,750
usually need lots years and years of

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,610
experience doing we've just cut all that

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,470
out and it leaves a really nice simple

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,480
shell that people can work with and it

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,010
really aligns nicely with kids because

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,600
they don't have to do all these fancy

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,510
things they can just hit the ground

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,710
running within like five minutes if you

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,880
want to see this in action we actually

00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,050
have a workshop tomorrow where we're

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,790
going to literally do that with kids

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,630
they'll just have games up and running

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,820
really quick and technically full

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,470
disclosure we aren't actually JavaScript

00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,100
so I appreciate you all welcomed me

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,400
welcoming me to your tier community we

00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,020
do do Lua which is also scripting but

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,970
not quite the same it has its own fun

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,990
little quirks anyway

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,490
I didn't really want to talk too much

00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:07,370
about robots specifically I did want to

00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:10,250
talk about our developers because

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,200
they're a pretty unique Bunch they're

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,910
like a lot of people you probably know

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,660
they're very passionate very talented

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,890
very driven but they're also very young

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,720
because we're a platform that's

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,240
primarily aimed at kids are the games on

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,510
our platforms are played by kids you

00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,870
know 9 10 11 and they suddenly get this

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,920
kind of realization moment usually when

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,760
they're kind of like in middle school

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,560
there get a little more tech-savvy

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,590
they're playing all these games on the

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,230
platform they realize oh these games

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:42,650
were also made by kids maybe I could do

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,330
that too and so they often start off

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,739
being like okay well let's just dive

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,030
into this and again we try to make it

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,590
very simple for people to get started

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,810
you don't have to learn you don't have

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,370
to learn about you know a big fancy game

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,290
engine you can just get a project going

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,360
on day one and so they'll just

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,010
experiment they'll just try things a lot

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,410
of these kids are self-motivated

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,150
self-learn they try to just recreate

00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,950
games that they see or just recreate

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,860
little mechanics or they'll

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,140
reverse-engineer you know it's something

00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,940
that they've seen and so they're a very

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,340
interesting bunch and I really like

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,230
working with them for lots of reasons

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:19,520
and that's mainly what I'm going to talk

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,510
about throughout this talk and I want to

00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,979
start off by just giving you a little

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,310
case study just to kind of paint you a

00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:25,200
picture of

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,340
kind of one of our one of our typical

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,620
users so this is Brandon LaRouche he

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,290
started very young with roblox I think

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,880
he was probably about like 10 or 11 he

00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,680
played with his brother his twin brother

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,590
actually it's weird I knew a lot of

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,270
twins on roblox it's weirdest thing and

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,470
they all come in pairs like they don't

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,770
do it individually they all do it

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,510
together yeah he started with his

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,190
brother and again it's this classic

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,690
story that I told you he just started

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,100
kind of playing games and then he

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,680
realized oh there's these really easy

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,390
development tools I guess I could

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,130
probably do that he didn't start off

00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,230
fancy he didn't try to make Skyrim or

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,660
anything like that he just you know made

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,300
little little platformer games or just

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,620
made little tiny game mechanics again

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,530
just try to recreate little things of

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,560
what he saw and from that he actually

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,740
realized like oh I really like software

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,210
development I really like coding and it

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,520
really could just jump started his

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:25,020
career again I want to emphasize very

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,060
very early so he took that and he went

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,030
beyond roblox although he's come back to

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,350
roblox since but he explored all kinds

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,410
of software development because of this

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,830
initial spark he explored baking mobile

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:41,640
apps he explored making websites he even

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,830
wrote books and again I want to I can't

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,160
emphasize this enough young he wrote two

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,840
books by the time he was fifteen I don't

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,160
know what I was doing when I was fifteen

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,229
I don't know what you were doing is when

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,850
you were fifteen I'm gonna guess that

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,789
you weren't writing books and this guy

00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:59,789
published - which just blows my mind

00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:01,430
it's it's amazing and also like his apps

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:05,160
like he's made apps that have like

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,550
650,000 downloads like again that's not

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:13,500
something I did when I was 1516 but

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:15,960
there he is and yeah and really what's

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,250
kind of neat about Brandon is that I was

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,630
fortunate enough to work with him he

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,729
actually came for an internship at our

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,100
company and then we liked him so much

00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,390
that we just hired him pretty much on

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,000
the spot I mean we have to wait for him

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,740
to finish school but he's so talented

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,600
from again just kind of jump-starting

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,030
really really early he didn't wait to

00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,520
finish high school or college to you

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,870
know develop his skills we're you know

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,080
when he's joining a company he's not

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,000
going

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,830
a junior level because he's basically

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,419
the technical lead on our development

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,979
website he started that up and he's an

00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:47,099
intern and we contracted him after it's

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:50,159
soft and so amazingly talented person

00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:51,509
and what's really cool about what I'm

00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,129
talking about today is that there are

00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,840
lots of brandon's out in the world just

00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:56,550
kind of wanted to paint you a picture of

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,020
one of them there lots of them that we

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,430
work with and so to kind of segue from

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,099
that I want to talk about some of the

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,620
programs that we do and again this is

00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:09,690
sort of gives the context of how we work

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,629
with these developers so we have two

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:15,060
programs that we run on-site in our

00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:16,469
offices down in San Mateo by the way yes

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,780
I'm from California and I'm really glad

00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:22,229
that it's not smoky up here so really

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,419
refreshing change yeah so we run two

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:26,219
programs in our offices and they're both

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,449
essentially mentorship programs we have

00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:29,340
what are called our incubators and

00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,770
accelerators difference isn't too

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,279
important basically we bring these kids

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:37,560
on-site to give us some direct platform

00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,969
feedback because their domain experts on

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,349
our platform so we want to make sure

00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:41,879
they can talk with engineers and say hey

00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:43,250
you know it'd be nice if we could fix

00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,289
this would be nice we had this feature

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:49,020
but the other really big part of these

00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:50,569
programs and whoa Kisan here is that we

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,740
give them mentorship and guidance

00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:53,969
because really the theme of what i want

00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,650
to talk about today is that there's lots

00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:58,680
of these young developers out there who

00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:00,389
are really gifted and talented but

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,120
they're lacking in some just kind of

00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:05,310
real world expertise a lot of them again

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,529
our self-taught self-motivated you know

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,240
they you know watch videos on YouTube

00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,639
they read tutorials they just kind of

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,020
try things out a lot of times they'll

00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,969
come to us as sort of lone wolves

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,740
they're like yeah I've dabbled with

00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:18,750
everything I've learned a lot but then

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,949
they don't really know how to take that

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,080
to the next level they don't know how to

00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:24,180
achieve like their vision of creating a

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,599
game or making an app in our case is

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,569
pretty much exclusively games but again

00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:32,550
it this applies to pretty much anything

00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,740
and so yeah when they come to us we

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,199
really just kind of kickstart them

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,699
through development of their games you

00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:40,440
know we sit them down they make sure

00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:42,360
that they have a plan make sure that

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,800
they assemble teams make sure that

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,589
they're prototyping again just all these

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,060
things that maybe not may not be super

00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,740
obvious to a developer

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,930
who's just starting out but something

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,750
that we as industry experts can kind of

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,950
impart upon them and it's kind of kind

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,820
of shows you some of the things that

00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,470
came out of this

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,620
there's just three titles that happen in

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,600
we are a platform and just to give you

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,610
some context across these three titles

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,120
there's more than two billion game plays

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:11,400
across all three of them it's just again

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,290
just blows my mind the success of some

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,680
of these young devs have these are all

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:19,350
people like half my age and it's just

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,490
it's I don't know I just get flex I

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,870
can't talk about them because they're

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:27,660
just so amazing so yeah again so we work

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,740
with these kids on site and so now I'll

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,180
just talk about you know some of the

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,100
learnings that we have and like how we

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,500
how we work with them and how we guide

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,390
them in how we mentor them and again

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,870
giving the context that they're all

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,490
really really young so kind of one of

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,420
the first lessons we learned very early

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:47,760
on was not trying to tell them what to

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,740
do in terms of like make this game

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,830
implement this thing do it this way use

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,660
this tech we definitely tried that early

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,100
on we were like hey you know let's let's

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,500
try to have you make this game we had a

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,720
very heavy-handed approach in all

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,980
aspects of their development from the

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,470
design to the implementation and you

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,420
know we we we met a lot of resistance I

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,430
think that if you if they even work with

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,050
kids or work with almost anyone really

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,270
no one really likes to be forced to do

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,220
what to do we don't want to be told what

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:20,430
to do they don't to be forced rather

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,170
they you want to be guiding people and

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,350
so that's kind of what we shifted

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,820
towards was instead of telling them hey

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,620
here's the games that you should make we

00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,500
instead try to just inspire and guide

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,020
them one of the classic stories I like

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,670
to actually tell about this in terms of

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,360
not forcing is that one of our early

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:41,209
early folks in fact the person who made

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,670
that game on the far left in each city

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:45,779
he came in he pitched a game to us he's

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,670
like oh we're gonna make this game

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,930
you're gonna just socialize or hang out

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,250
with your friends there might be some

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,209
mini games it might make a house but

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,120
really it's just kind of this social

00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:57,270
hangout thing and a whole bunch of

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,920
veteran gaming people looked at him or

00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,620
just like that

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,220
never going to work do something else

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,120
make this other

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,460
game he did it it was okay and then he

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,260
came back and made me city and again

00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,970
this is the game that we said hey don't

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,490
you know this game probably is not gonna

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,990
work but then it did it's super super

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,520
popular as one of our top games of the

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,190
platform and it has been for like over a

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,850
year so again kind of lesson we got from

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,260
that was you know the people that were

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,910
working with these young developers they

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,130
have a dream they have a vision and they

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:32,340
also really understand these new

00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:34,770
audiences as well and so really what

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,420
we're looking to do with them is again

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:40,620
not tell them what to do but just help

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:43,200
them reach their goals so in terms of

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,970
inspiring you know really what we do is

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,100
we try to help them refine their ideas

00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,930
so kind of the example I like to use for

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,510
that is one of the very first things

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,460
we'll do with kids when they come join

00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,590
these programs we talk about their game

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,240
pitches I don't know if you're familiar

00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,710
with this but quite often you'll hear

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,260
there's a term called an elevator pitch

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,910
where you have to try to exploit boil

00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,200
your game down so that if you're talking

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,210
with someone in like two minutes you

00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,460
could convey what it is and they could

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,830
kind of buy into that and we took that a

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,000
step further than we're saying okay

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,100
typically I usually hear like say it's

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,770
like do this in two minutes we tell them

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,770
okay you've got 15 seconds to sell me on

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:21,240
your game and you know it's a tough

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,250
challenge they don't they can't do that

00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,470
right away they have to work on really

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,780
boiling down and distilling their game's

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,940
mechanics to the real core of what

00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,430
they're trying to do it's a big

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,930
challenge but it really helps them think

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,940
critically about what they're trying to

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,470
do because well quite often if you just

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,000
sort of let these young developers loose

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,560
they have a million ideas that go in a

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,140
million different directions and they

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,300
just spaghetti all over the place and by

00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,190
kind of just saying hey take a step back

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,070
just think correctly about what you're

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,110
doing it really helps them focus it and

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,570
get started on the right foot and we

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,570
kind of carry all carry that through the

00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,160
whole process so that goes to you know

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,960
thinking about their game mechanics you

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,910
know don't try to do a billion things

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,920
try to really hone in a couple really

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:08,760
core nice things you can execute well on

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,800
and it applies to all areas of their

00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,650
design to you know their interface their

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,830
environment design just their just their

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,360
game mechanics

00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,740
because really once they do that then

00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,899
they can arrive at a really nice clean

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:24,610
idea and execute on it and then another

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:26,649
thing that we try to help them do again

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,740
as I said a lot of these kids will come

00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:32,410
to us just again having done this all on

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,089
their own they you know just you know

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,430
we're in their bedroom and they just

00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:38,620
were hacking away and that's great they

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,050
learned a lot but I think as you all

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,329
know any project of any kind of

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,310
significant size even even smaller

00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:46,390
projects you really need to have a team

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,519
you can't do it alone

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,170
and that's a thing that a lot of these

00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,820
young developers don't always

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,380
necessarily understand you know

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,390
sometimes they'll be working with their

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,250
friends and whatnot but by and large the

00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,720
pattern that I've seen is that they're

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,089
they're trying they think that they can

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,910
do it all and they try to do it all and

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:05,950
I definitely encourage people to touch

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,180
all different areas of development I

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,010
mean that's what I did on my journey I

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,329
was a full-stack engineer and learned

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,920
very quickly about the areas of

00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:14,950
development that I didn't like so I

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,779
definitely like people exploring but I

00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,040
do want people to kind of understand you

00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:19,720
know what are the areas that I'm really

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,130
passionate about because when you have

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,020
that sort of intrinsic motivation when

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,959
you love what you're doing it makes it

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,089
that much more easy to be successful and

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,440
you know you make your projects work and

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:31,149
so the things that we'll do with these

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,350
teams is we'll help them understand ok

00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:34,120
you know what are the things that you're

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,920
good at where are the things that you

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,209
enjoy doing and the things that you

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,920
either you know don't enjoy doing or

00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,240
don't think you have the time for you

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,029
know let's help you figure out how to

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,410
form a team around that how can you you

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:46,720
know hire artists how can you

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,980
collaborate with other coders you know a

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,899
lot of these kids haven't worked with

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,980
any kind of you know source control or

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:53,260
version or anything like that

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,209
so collaboration is a really big

00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,880
learning for a lot of these young devs

00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:59,860
and then you know just even things in

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,449
terms of leadership and just the soft

00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,790
skills involved with working with other

00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:05,170
people it's not all just tech you know

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,730
you have to get along with the people

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,959
you're working with or if you don't get

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,380
along you have to figure out how to not

00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:12,550
work with them and you know I I'm glad

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,110
that I don't have to do this but some of

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,120
the other people who work with these

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,680
kids who are a little bit more closely

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,079
involved the program you know they're

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,220
dealing with just drama in situations

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,010
because you know they're just dealing

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,810
with humans these are things that you

00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,160
have to learn and fortunately for these

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:33,129
developers they're learning it

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:34,930
early and the other thing that I kind of

00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,190
want to make sure that you sort of take

00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,350
away from this because this is a big

00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,889
thing that we also want to that we also

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,449
had to learn so somewhat the hard way is

00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:46,569
you know thinking about diversity in

00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:48,149
term in your for your developers and the

00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:51,069
kind of people that you're looking to

00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:52,240
attract again I'm not saying suggesting

00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:54,100
that all of you go out and start a

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,730
mentorship program and recruit 50 devs

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,470
to work for you you know this can go you

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,750
know be as large or as small as you want

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,610
but you know when you're working with

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,589
anyone who you think has kind of that

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,290
fire that sparked that vision that

00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:13,449
person who could really be encouraged to

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:15,279
grow into a developer you know there's

00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:17,259
some times I've noticed in the industry

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,420
I mean this is true for gaming so I

00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:21,009
don't know if how widely it extends by

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,800
imagine it's pretty true for software

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:25,779
there's this kind of celebrity persona

00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,939
of like a hotshot developer or like a

00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:30,009
rock star and you know when you've set

00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:31,360
up programs to attract people like yeah

00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:33,399
let's get the best of the best of the

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,959
best you know well advertise like that

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,230
we're like we are looking for the next

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,449
new stars looking for hotshots and you

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,300
know the truth of the matter is you know

00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:46,509
there's two things wrong with that one

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:50,019
you know a lot of people just don't

00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:51,519
self-identify that way you know when

00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:52,959
you're asking about that you're asking

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,319
for sort of like a personality type

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,420
rather than a skill set and you know

00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,160
just a lot of people that you know I've

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,800
worked with through this program they

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,910
don't think of themselves as like

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,990
celebrities in the programming world you

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,600
know they just want to work they just

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:11,650
want to learn skills they want to do a

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,329
certain project and you know that's

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,760
something that we had to learn and we

00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:18,100
had to to work to diversify our teams

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,720
was to say like okay you know let's not

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,589
focus on like trying to get the best of

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,689
the best of the best

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:24,789
let's try to get a big range of people

00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:27,220
because they're gonna give us you know

00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,960
not they're gonna give us a really good

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,960
wealth of feedback to because they're

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,610
coming from so many different areas of

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,710
expertise and so you know we look for

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,870
people that not necessarily are like top

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,650
of their field but we try to find people

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,390
who really have dry

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,580
and have passion and look like they're

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,200
really gonna stick with something so not

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,790
someone who so will definitely accept

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,290
people into our programs who aren't you

00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,300
know mate maybe they have a lot to learn

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,590
in terms of like technical skills but

00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,660
they've shown that they're like yeah you

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,950
know I've you've got a lot to learn

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,420
learn but I've worked on this game for

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,090
three years it's my passion project

00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,860
we're like that's really cool we want to

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:04,190
help you overcome whatever things are

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:07,070
stopping you from from making it and so

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:09,740
you know by focusing on you know the

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,090
passion and the drive you know you help

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,280
out these people because you're setting

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,010
also setting them up for expectations of

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,170
you know we're gonna focus on not you

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,700
know boosting your ego and making you

00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,890
feel really cool but we're gonna help

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,300
you do really cool things and that's so

00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,040
it's gonna help you get a bigger range

00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,050
of people to just the talent pool is

00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,570
much wider if you you know think about

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:36,410
just you know you know passion and drive

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:39,500
I think and so you know where what what

00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,809
to do with this again as I said I'm not

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,110
really fully expecting anyone here to

00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:47,360
you know set up big programs I think

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,070
that this can work at scale at pretty

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,390
much any level you know so if you do

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,250
work with some kind of like developer

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,710
relations team like I do you can

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,360
probably you know do some sorts of

00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,900
mentorships you know either in person or

00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:02,150
virtually you know a large scale but it

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,309
can also just work with one person you

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,620
know if there's someone in your

00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:09,320
community someone your family a friend

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:11,090
that you know you know I think that

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,820
these sorts of lessons about you know

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,590
just teaching them how to realize their

00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,880
dreams instead of just saying you know

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,559
hey you want to be a software engineer

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,750
just do this project this project this

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,750
project you're done you know really help

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,370
them explore the ideas that they want to

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,750
do and help them think through the

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:29,390
problems that they're going to encounter

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,679
facing that because you know really

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,120
there's so many people in so many

00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,040
different ideas that we're not gonna be

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,090
able to help them we're you know they're

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,010
just gonna come up with all kinds of

00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,840
things that will never think of and the

00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,670
things that we can do as industry

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,920
experts and as veterans as we can

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,929
you know help them just understand what

00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,870
the stumbling blocks will be help them

00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:51,050
understand you know what what challenges

00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:53,150
will will get in their way

00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,680
and so you know that's that's very good

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,240
for like a one-on-one mentorship thing

00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,680
and then you know also there's never

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,670
been a better time for people to just

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,930
get started as well you know sometimes

00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,250
you know I was saying you know don't do

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,260
like I have you handed do this project

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,430
do this prior to this project that's

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,830
true although I do think you know when

00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,300
you're very very very green and new is

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,340
nice to have sort of project-based

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,290
learning to kind of help you get started

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,300
and there's lots of great resources for

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:20,600
that the power of code is a really

00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:23,450
really big thing now you know a lot and

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,310
there's a huge wealth of camps programs

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,140
and stuff that you know particularly

00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,850
kids can get involved with to get

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,800
started but again I definitely want to

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,630
make sure that you know if you're you

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,650
know if you're if you again have like a

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,270
young person in your life you're like

00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,620
okay there's this cool camp that you can

00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,050
go to there's this cool class that you

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,630
can take well make sure that you know

00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,890
you help them think about again just the

00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,930
things that they're trying to make and

00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,670
not just say hey you should go to this

00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,110
camp because learning programming is

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,310
good you know we're going to the Future

00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,900
everyone's going to need to know some

00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:53,300
kind of programming which i think is

00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,130
true but you know help them understand

00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,080
why that's important especially if they

00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,720
do you know play games or if they do

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,550
like like some app on their phone or if

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,350
they do like some website they're like

00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,360
man it'll be really cool you know I can

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,910
maybe make that help them understand yes

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,020
you actually can make these things you

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,810
know these things were made by people

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,580
just like you and you can get there and

00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:16,520
all you need to do is just give them the

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,260
tools and caps or the guidance to make

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:23,540
that happen

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:25,460
so and yeah I'm got a little bit of time

00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,320
left but yeah pretty much out of slides

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,070
but thank you very much everyone it's

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,070
