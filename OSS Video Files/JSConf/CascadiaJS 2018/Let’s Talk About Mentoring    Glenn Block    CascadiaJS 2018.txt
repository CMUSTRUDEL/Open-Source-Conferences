Description: 
	Throughout my career I've had many mentors who have been critical to my own growth. I'll just say it, you should have a mentor and you should be a mentor. Intrigued to know why? Come to this talk. In this session we'll talk about why you should care about mentoring and how it can help you with your career, how you can find a mentor, the components of a mentor-lationship, what makes a good mentor, and how you can become one.
