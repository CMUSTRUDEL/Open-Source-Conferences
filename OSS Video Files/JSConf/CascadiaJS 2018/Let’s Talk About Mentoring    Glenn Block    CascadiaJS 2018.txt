Description: 
	Throughout my career I've had many mentors who have been critical to my own growth. I'll just say it, you should have a mentor and you should be a mentor. Intrigued to know why? Come to this talk. In this session we'll talk about why you should care about mentoring and how it can help you with your career, how you can find a mentor, the components of a mentor-lationship, what makes a good mentor, and how you can become one.

it is ok everyone how's everybody doing

00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,870
really cool to be at Cascadia j/s the

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,690
first year so I've known Carter for a

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,150
long time and the first Cascadia JSI

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,880
helped out for a hot minute but i never

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,460
actually made it to the event so i'm

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,930
really stoked to be here today talking

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,750
about a topic I'm really passionate

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,609
about which is mentoring just to tell

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,529
you a little bit about me I've been in

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,599
the industry yeah I'm old I've been in

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,079
the industry a little over 20 years I

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,380
started off my career as a software

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,590
developer and then halfway in I moved

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,360
over to the product side and I worked at

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,500
some great companies doing product

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,200
Microsoft Splunk

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,480
cloud did a lot of open source really

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,960
passionate about working with community

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,379
and lately I've also been getting really

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,750
involved with stem helping people of

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,879
diversity I'm also an advisor for code

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,129
fellows and that fits really well with

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,850
the topic that I'm going to speak about

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:11,400
today which is mentoring how many people

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:15,090
here actually have a mentor just a few

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,220
of you anybody here who is a mentor okay

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,930
well if I come back a year from now I'm

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,680
gonna try to make sure a lot more hands

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,860
go up

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,780
I particularly want for people that are

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,850
I know we have a lot of folks that are

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,770
the scholars that are looking to get

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,420
into the tech industry please pay

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,820
attention to this talk because I think

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,409
mentoring is something that really can

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,840
help you and it has really helped me in

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,110
my own career and for those of you that

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,329
have been around awhile really I'm going

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,130
to encourage you also to mentor others

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,899
and you can give back and you can help

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,040
them and a lot of folks today are

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,899
concerned about a lot of the barriers

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,329
that we know that people face in the

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,549
industry and mentoring is one way to

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,950
help overcome those barriers I'll talk a

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,259
bit a bit more about that as we go

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,899
forward let's start off we're talking

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,390
about what is a mentor so the first

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,000
thing that a mentor is is a guide and an

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,369
advisor now you'll see here I have a lot

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,319
of mountainous pictures so I've gotten

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,270
really into like mountaineering and rock

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,560
climbing recently so but

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,180
one of the things about mountaineering

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,490
and rock climbing is you're trying to

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,010
get to some type of peak you're trying

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,660
to get to some destination and you need

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,310
help to do that and that's really one

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,010
one of the things that a mentor does

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,720
they're a guide they've been to places

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,130
that you haven't been and they can

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,130
advise you along the way

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,910
generally a mentor is somebody who's

00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,370
gone out of their way to volunteer

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,280
because they want to enable others to be

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,320
successful now this could be somebody

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,990
who works in your company and they're

00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,580
paid but still when you look at

00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,470
different organizations where people

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,150
mentor that's generally something that

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,620
they're doing because they want to do

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,930
that and that's something you should

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,790
think about as a mentee that the person

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,830
that's doing this is doing this because

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,830
they want to not because they have to

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,790
generally a mentor is going to have more

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,680
experience than you do

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:13,600
they're going to be able to help you in

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,010
an area where you want to grow so let's

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,340
talk about some of the ways that a

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,900
mentor can help you many successful

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,060
people and there's an article recently

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,220
in Forbes magazine about this will tell

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,209
you that mentors have been key to their

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:31,270
success why well one of the things that

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,490
a mentor can do is provide insight they

00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,230
can see things that you can't see they

00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,940
can look at things at a different level

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,490
that maybe you're not looking at and

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,890
they can help you to kind of navigate

00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,560
difficult types of situations with that

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:47,260
insight that they provide in particular

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,810
I found in my own career when I had

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,910
mentors that were very very senior to me

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,980
who had been around a long time in the

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,140
industry they would be able to have that

00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,450
kind of insight a lot of us are

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,340
developers so another place this can

00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,560
help is like if you're working on a

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,180
problem and you have a mentor they may

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,459
be able to say oh you probably actually

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,590
really want to solve it this way because

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,020
this is going to have these implications

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,000
I know this because of these other types

00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:18,190
of systems that we've built in the past

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,300
a key thing that mentors can provide is

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,770
a safe space so often and a mentor does

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,500
not have to be in your company

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,360
most of many of my mentors

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,400
do not work in the same company that I'm

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,980
in and one of the advantages of that is

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,020
they can be much more objective I can

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,330
talk to them about my situation I don't

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,370
have to be able I don't have to hold my

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,140
tongue and I can say you know I really

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,850
have this problem that I'm going through

00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,280
I don't know what to do

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,680
this person is pissing me off I can't

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,280
figure this thing out and they can sit

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,900
there objectively and and give you some

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:57,670
advice on how to be able to deal with

00:04:52,900 --> 00:05:00,880
that situation they can also really help

00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:03,340
you to fill gaps in your skills so they

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,200
can say you know you can go to a mentor

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:09,040
and say hey I really want to learn this

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,630
thing can you help me and many times you

00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,000
will find that the answer you will get

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:16,450
will be yes and there's many different

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,300
ways that a mentor can help one if it's

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,550
at your job you can possibly shadow them

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,320
so they can basically say hey come along

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,070
and as I go through this thing I'll

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,820
bring you with me

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,470
so you can shadow and you can learn

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,820
other mentors maybe they'll just sit

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,380
down with you and they'll walk you

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,990
through something I'll give you an

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,820
example and let me just point this out

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,220
mentoring is something you can find a

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,990
mentor at any point in your career it's

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,030
not something that you have to be junior

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,370
I have many mentors and I've been in the

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,729
industry for a long time and in my

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,740
current job where I work I I stepped

00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:52,390
into a role where I had much more scope

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,000
and I had to do things that I never had

00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,250
to do before like dealing with pricing I

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,690
never dealt with pricing before I've

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,229
written lots of code I never dealt with

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:04,840
pricing so I reached out to our VP of

00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,210
Finance in the company and said hey can

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,770
you help and he was able to do that he

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,960
was able to walk me through point me out

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,120
literature that would help me to get the

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,979
foundation that I needed to be able to

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,060
make the types of decisions I was going

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:21,190
to have to make another key thing that

00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,130
mentors can do and which was extremely

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,950
helpful for me in my career is they can

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,960
connect you to their network they can

00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,060
make lots of different connections to

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,440
people that will help you in your

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:37,810
advancement to give you an example early

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,810
on when I joined Microsoft I joined in

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,240
one role as a product planner actually

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,610
to blog post about this and I realized

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,100
that that wasn't really the place that I

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,750
wanted to be but I was working with a

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,850
lot of different partners in different

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,730
product teams at Microsoft and I was

00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,550
trying to make those connections by just

00:06:53,730 --> 00:07:00,690
doing good work and being being reliable

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,180
and that led to me basically shifting my

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,320
entire career through those connections

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,330
because one of the people that I worked

00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,639
with was on the product side and he said

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,800
hey you should consider doing this he

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,290
connected me with other program managers

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,620
and that had an amazing effect on my

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:19,200
career so I would really advise making

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,880
those kinds of connections is really

00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,470
going to benefit you and there's a lot

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,490
of different ways that you can do that

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,460
from meetups

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:31,110
to social - in your own work environment

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,380
another thing that mentors can do is

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,990
they can create opportunities because

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,430
you're in the back of the mentors mind

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,280
and they're thinking about you whoever

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,320
the mentor is when an opportunity comes

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,390
up that they think might be a good fit

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,430
for you they can actually put your name

00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,500
in and I've seen this happen several

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,200
times in my own career like when I was

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,000
at Microsoft I had a mentor who was a

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,830
partner at Microsoft he'd been there for

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,110
a very long time so I didn't work for

00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,910
him and he became my mentor because I

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,680
approached him and asked him I just said

00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,690
hey can you be my mentor and he said

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,490
sure I'll do that because somebody had

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,250
advised me that having mentors was a

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,020
good thing and he actually created tons

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,419
of opportunity in my career where he

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,350
said oh yeah he heard about something

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,330
that was happening at a different

00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:19,250
organization and said that's a good fit

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:21,570
for Glen let's let's get Glen to do that

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,970
so let's talk about the different types

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,530
of career mentors there actually are

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,590
many different mentors you can have life

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:31,169
mentors but I'm gonna I classify career

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,390
mentors into kind of three so there's a

00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:35,789
role focused mentor that's somebody who

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,890
really just helps you do your job they

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,390
know your job better than you and they

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,190
can help you do that and many

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,640
organizations have like a buddy system

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,440
for example where you join in a

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,050
particular role and your junior they're

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,490
going to assign somebody to you but a

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:54,470
key thing I would say about mentoring is

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,420
you can go after it you don't have to

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,760
wait til somebody comes to you and says

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,670
oh we have a mentoring program and we

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,709
want to match you up you can go out

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,700
there and you can find a mentor to fill

00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:11,360
the gaps that you've identified career

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,160
growth focused so a career growth

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,990
focused mentor is kind of like the one

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,990
that I mentioned before somebody who

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,060
generally has a lot more experience they

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,250
may be much more senior than you and

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,589
they're looking across a much broader

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,430
perspective and they're helping you to

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:30,709
see things from a different angle so for

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,410
example the person that I mentioned his

00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:34,820
name was John Gossman I remember when I

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,770
was at Microsoft when there were some

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,690
things that were going on within the

00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,760
organization that I didn't understand

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,950
and I was able to go to him and say hey

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,050
can you explain this to me and he would

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,910
look at he would show it to me from a

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,520
completely different perspective and

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,529
over time I actually started to see

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,410
things from that perspective so that's

00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:57,079
how mentoring really helped me it helped

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,910
me to basically orientate my lens to

00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,130
look at things in a different way and to

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:04,730
start to think of things in a broader

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,290
perspective you can also get a mentor

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,779
that helps you just with a very specific

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,000
skill I talked I gave you my pricing

00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:13,220
example where I just wanted to learn how

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,980
to do pricing and I went to somebody who

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:23,000
really knew pricing to work with me see

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:25,760
I think I'm missing a slide no actually

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,490
no those are all of them ok so let's

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,560
talk about what makes a good mentor one

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:34,339
key thing is that a mentor is more

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,500
experienced than you now many people may

00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:38,120
be thinking well how much experience do

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,459
I have to have really to be a mentor

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,920
really you just have to have experience

00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:44,390
that somebody else needs and why I'm

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,700
saying that is you don't have to wait

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:49,339
until you have 10 years of experience in

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,649
industry for example to be a mentor as

00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:53,180
long as you have acquired a certain

00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,420
amount of knowledge that you think that

00:10:53,180 --> 00:11:00,850
other people need you can actually be a

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,850
mentor to that to that individual a

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,730
mentor should be somebody that you feel

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,730
comfortable talking to

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,410
they're gonna help you and they're only

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,480
going to be able to help you in as much

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,279
as you're able to give them the

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,889
information that they need to help you

00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,389
be successful what are your goals what

00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:20,220
are your desires what are the things

00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,779
that you're actually struggling with I'm

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,809
not saying they're a therapist let's

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:26,759
keep it in the work kind of career

00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:29,100
context but you should feel comfortable

00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:31,259
talking to them I often advise people

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,209
that are trying to find mentors to

00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:34,819
really look at this if you don't feel

00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,989
comfortable talking to that person

00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,100
you're not really going to be they're

00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,269
not really going to be able to help you

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,209
and you're not really gonna be able to

00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:43,559
find the help that you need

00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:46,199
trust this goes hand-in-hand with that

00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,679
as well the whole idea of a mentor is

00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:50,939
someone that you feel that you can

00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:52,889
reveal to them a whole bunch of details

00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:54,899
in order for them to be able to help you

00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:58,139
but you're not gonna do that if you feel

00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,109
you can't trust them so one thing about

00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,910
trust really is confidentiality that's

00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:05,100
what that means that the things that are

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,439
told to the mentor stay with the mentor

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,439
or at least that mentor gets your

00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:11,730
permission and will say that so I mentor

00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:14,699
a lot of people and I will say are you

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:18,769
okay if I say so and so I'm not gonna

00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:18,769
just go go ahead and do it on my own

00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:26,699
this has certainly been a challenge for

00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:28,709
me they have to be a good listener the

00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:31,259
mentor is really there to serve you

00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:33,059
remember that if you get a mentor it's

00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,100
not that you're there to make the mends

00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:37,230
who are happy the whole idea of the

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,169
mentor is to help you make that journey

00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,359
if they're not a good listener they're

00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:44,220
not gonna really be understanding and

00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:45,749
understanding your problems and they're

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,389
not gonna be giving you the space to

00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:50,459
really try to work through them because

00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:53,189
a mentors job is not to solve the

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:55,319
problem for you that's the whole idea of

00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:57,449
advice it's to help you see help you

00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:58,980
look at things in a different way think

00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:00,720
about how to get up that trail but

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,459
you're the one who ultimately has to do

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,889
it consistency and availability is

00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,839
really important now there's a

00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,519
relationship that builds between a

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,860
mentor and a mentee and there's an

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,470
agreement that happens and whatever that

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,869
agreement is as far as availability and

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,260
time that should be something that the

00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:22,350
men

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,170
or sticks to it's also on the menti it

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,540
goes both ways but if you have a mentor

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,100
that's flaking out who's not willing to

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,410
give the time then you should find

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,910
another mentor who is willing to give

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,560
that time because otherwise you're just

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:40,140
you're just wasting your time and you're

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,460
not actually making the progress so I

00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,160
wanted to give a couple of pointers

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,950
about how to find a mentor so one thing

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,820
you can do is many companies do have a

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:54,080
mentoring program and one thing I always

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:58,460
found kooky just telling a story is that

00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:02,460
Microsoft has a mentoring program and

00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:05,010
they basically require at the time would

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,650
require required that you were an

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:10,110
employee for a year before you could get

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,880
a mentor I hope that's actually changed

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,340
because what I really needed the mentor

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,470
was earliest on so what did I do when

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,020
the program wouldn't really allow me to

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,540
be in it I just went and found a mentor

00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,550
on my own anyway so you don't need the

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,220
program but if there is a program it can

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:31,320
be a really useful resource to be able

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,840
to connect with others you can just

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,370
approach a friend or a co-worker tell

00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,050
your friend your coworker like hey

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,120
here's something I really like to learn

00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:41,790
I think you have a bunch of experience

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,250
that I could benefit from would you be

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,260
willing to be my mentor and I have found

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,330
consistently that most of the time when

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,890
or I would say consistently when I've

00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,110
gone to people and said to them hey

00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:54,600
would you mentor me the answer is

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,640
generally a yes once in a while it might

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,040
be a no and if they're not at a place

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,410
where there will able to give that

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,480
commitment then no is actually a good

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,630
thing it's saving both of us a lot of

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,760
heartache and hardship a key thing I

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:12,750
would say too is that people respond to

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,640
honesty and when someone is genuine so

00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,250
when you go to someone and ask them for

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,490
a mentor to be your mentor be prepared

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,050
to actually work because every mentor is

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,600
going to they're going to get

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:27,120
discouraged as a mentor if they see that

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,770
they're advising you or giving you like

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,840
they might say a mentor might say hey go

00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,720
read this book this book is really going

00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,820
to help you

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,920
well if you're not going to do those

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,960
things that the mentor is advising on

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,420
that's going to help you to learn then

00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:43,780
that relationship is probably not going

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:47,860
to work out very well there's lots of

00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:50,470
online communities where you can go to

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,330
find mentors one that because I come

00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,880
from the product side one I'll call out

00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,380
is the mind the product slack so for any

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,390
folks here that are interested in like

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,160
product management or learning more

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:04,030
about product they have a great

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,330
mentoring community there and you can

00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:10,360
also use social media so this is my VP

00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:15,610
of Marketing at all 0 we call them gonto

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,740
and he recently went went on Twitter and

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,290
he posted and said hey you know I'd like

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,480
to talk to somebody who has experience

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,980
in a company our size leading a product

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,520
team and that's because he was stepping

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:30,280
into an acting VP of Product role so

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,530
this is a good illustration of someone

00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,660
who is quite seasoned in their career

00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,730
who's going out there and asking for

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:42,430
help so you're never too old or too

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:43,330
experienced to ask for a mentor so I'm

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,250
gonna talk about a couple of other

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,470
things quickly which is why should you

00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,410
mentor so there's we talked a lot about

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,960
the benefits of having a mentor but what

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,900
are the benefits of being a mentor one

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,550
key thing is just about do it's doing

00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,560
good you're helping other people be

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,780
successful and if you believe in the

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,580
concept of pay it forward that when you

00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,949
do good things it's going to come back

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,020
to you I truly believe in that and have

00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:09,640
seen that so you are in a place to

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,750
really help other people be successful

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,280
in the industry and you can help break

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,650
barriers and this one has been really

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,920
personal for me you know I know for

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,810
example as a white male that I have had

00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,000
a lot of advantages and I tweeted about

00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,680
this a while ago I said I've gotten

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,160
double advantages one being white

00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,140
another being male in technology and so

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,730
that puts me in a place where I feel

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,510
like I have a responsibility to help

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,140
break Briery

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:40,300
blah break barriers for others and I can

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,400
do that why because I can help them

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,560
introduce them to my network I can

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,450
advocate

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,610
I can guide them on what are the things

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:52,530
that they need to do in order to be

00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:56,100
successful I can help the industry as a

00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:58,800
mentor why because I'm helping to groom

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,510
the next generation I'm helping to make

00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,150
sure that the people that are in this

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:06,060
industry care and are doing the right

00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,830
things and I can inculcate in them the

00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:12,810
right principles and things to care

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:15,690
about mentoring will help you be a

00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,940
leader if you have aspirations of one

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,650
day for example being a manager then

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,890
mentoring is really going to help you

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,870
because you're gonna get a lot of the

00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,630
experience a key thing of being a

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,030
manager is being able to listen and

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:33,030
being able to advise and you're going to

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,770
get a lot of that plus you're going to

00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,360
understand the challenges that the

00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,360
people that you're mentoring or going

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,910
through and all of that experience is

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,770
going to lead into helping you to be a

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,380
better leader and manager in the future

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,880
and this one is really really important

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,000
and and this is one of the reasons why

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,070
for myself I focused a lot over the last

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,070
number of years on mentoring women and

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:58,380
people of color is to just overcome your

00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,880
unconscious biases and we all have them

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,490
it's not saying you're like a bad person

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,650
we all have these biases that we were

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:08,250
born you know that we've picked up

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:10,290
through our culture and we act based on

00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,240
those biases but if you become conscious

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:16,080
of them you can it you can attack them

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,570
you can battle them and for me talking

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,280
to people that are in a very challenged

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,440
position and hearing their challenges

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,050
and understanding them and understanding

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:29,010
the things that I shouldn't do or should

00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:32,270
do to help them has been super valuable

00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,270
it's made me a better person

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:40,710
so getting close to the end but I have a

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:43,320
special treat coming up but I would

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,760
advise you all to go get a mentor and be

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,510
a mentor and you can have multiple

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,160
mentors so now for the last part of my

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,350
talk I've got somebody really special

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,240
that I want to bring up I've talked a

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,020
lot about how as a mentor you have this

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,390
opportunity to help other

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,450
and so I'm gonna bring up my friend

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:04,630
Taylor who has an amazing story of how

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:07,110
she went from not working in the tech

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,910
industry to getting a developer job in

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:13,080
just about a year it's a great story

00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,080
come on up Taylor

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:27,960
can you guys hear me okay how are you

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:31,110
guys I'm really excited to be here it's

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,549
my first tech conference and so I wanted

00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,330
to kind of quickly share with you my

00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:38,610
story and how I landed a front end role

00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:41,280
in Seattle so if he looks to the left

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:44,880
you'll see me January 29th of this year

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,309
working at Boston Market as a fast food

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,150
server slash cashier and then to the

00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:54,840
right you see me on my first day as a

00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:57,299
professional software engineer so going

00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,370
back last year was when I started

00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:02,850
learning how to code I couldn't afford

00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:04,679
to go to a bootcamp or go back to

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,020
college for a computer science degree

00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,850
and I didn't really have much of a

00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,610
support system because I don't have a

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:15,090
college degree at all and I didn't know

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,860
anyone that was in stem and so how he

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,809
came across coding was because I watched

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,090
a documentary about Aaron Swartz Evie

00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:24,540
you guys have heard of him he was the

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:27,750
co-founder of Reddit and he really tried

00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,860
to use technology to impact politics and

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,830
that was what I was really passionate

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,660
about doing so I learned how to code

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:38,160
online through udemy.com

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,690
YouTube tutorials egghead and I built a

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,410
lot of projects and I'd sweeten my

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:46,410
progress every day on twitter using the

00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:48,360
100 days of code challenge and i used

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,679
that as a way to not only document my

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,480
progress and see what I've been learning

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,350
like every day but also to connect with

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:59,040
people I started networking online I'm

00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:00,600
an introvert and so I and I also cannot

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,740
like a force that goes like a meet-up or

00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,620
anything because I was in Orlando

00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,890
Florida and Orlando is dead when comes

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,630
to like tech opportunities so I was

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,000
unfortunate to be like in your Christie

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:15,059
aatul or anything like that but I was on

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,450
Twitter and I did get a hold of a lot of

00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:20,780
people who provided like support from

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,070
like around the world encouragement

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,230
constructive feedback on my projects and

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:29,850
on my work and it really meant a lot to

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:30,530
me and so because of Twitter also I got

00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,050
a hold

00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:36,200
of an employer in Seattle they have

00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:38,690
reached out to me and they had offered

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,660
me an interview and that is when I

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,550
landed my first role and I also wanted

00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,930
to give like a little bit of advice to

00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,480
people who are looking for like their

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,950
first job what really made me um stand

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,630
out to that employer and actually get

00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,190
touched I was because I did go through

00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,900
some technical interviews with other

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,590
companies and I remember like the

00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,670
questions they asked me and so when I

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,580
interviewed with the lead front-end

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:05,210
engineer I asked him all those questions

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:10,190
that I was asked I was like I was like

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:13,190
hey so what design patterns do you like

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:15,170
or what is clean code mean to you I

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,480
asked like those kind of questions

00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:20,060
um do you do unit testing performance

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,640
testing um you know I was just I flipped

00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,930
back on him to actually show they're

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,170
like you know I know what I'm you know

00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:29,600
like I know what I'm doing and that

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:33,320
really impressed them and so I got

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,480
offered the role and I just am now in

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,850
the process of wanting to like give back

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,490
to people so I'm also like mentoring

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,020
online on Twitter helping people out

00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:47,210
provide like some kind of support system

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:49,730
and I hope that my story is impactful

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,290
and that I hope that it's helps people

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,030
who are struggling because I remember

00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,820
those like late nights you know coding

00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,470
like every night I would like work at

00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,590
Boston Market for like eight to nine

00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:03,320
hours a day like sweeping floors mopping

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,690
bathrooms and you know dealing with like

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,840
micro managers and like it was just like

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,190
all that pain and like everything I was

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,440
going through because at the time my dad

00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:15,230
had died when I start learning how to

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,390
code it really really feels like my

00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,040
energies to learn how to code and select

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,480
Larenz like my first like role in tech

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,890
and I know it's like when the most like

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,000
competitive industries and I know they

00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,250
can get hard we didn't go into an

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,700
interview process but it does get better

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,800
and there will be a spot for you if you

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,750
just keep going and keep trying and just

00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:38,560
putting yourself out there and building

00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:38,560
projects so I hope this

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,020
