Title: The Future of the Web    Mikeal Rogers    CascadiaJS 2018

Description: 
	The original vision of the Internet was for a fully decentralized system that empowered its users at the edges. In the many years since the birth of The Web weâ€™ve moved more towards centralized structures to solve the issues of scale and data and it has not come without consequence. In order to move past these issues we need new primitives for a new vision of The Web that can be decentralized.

everybody how's everybody doing today

00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:11,309
that's me that's the stock all right so

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,400
I'm gonna talk about the future but

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,740
first we're gonna talk about the 90s

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,340
bait-and-switch I actually used to live

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,750
up here in the 90s I grew up up here and

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,630
the fashion just hasn't changed at all

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,869
it was it's just sweat shirts and fleece

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,310
from REI back in the 90s there'd be like

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:34,530
some neon windbreakers but it's

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:36,300
basically the same so back in the 90s

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,579
there was actually like this real fight

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,860
like kind of a war over what the future

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,690
of the internet would look like there

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,290
wasn't really an established application

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,660
platform

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,640
it was globally accessible and the view

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,050
of a lot of people including like vast

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,180
majority of the tech industry actually

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,620
and Bill Gates was that you would have

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,120
this thing that bill liked to call the

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,010
information superhighway which was like

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,840
you would just connect to companies

00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,670
products and they would all be like

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,230
unique and then you would download their

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,470
software and then connect to like their

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,659
backends and stuff to think about it now

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,100
it sounds relatively dystopic like you

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,530
had just connected these corporate sites

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,939
and get their content but like AOL was

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,920
like the most successful version of this

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,020
right which was it was a content portal

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,170
and rather than using the web you would

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,330
use this content portal and everybody

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,350
thought that this was gonna win not a

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,670
lot of people thought in the web was

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,500
gonna win and if you're looking at them

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,790
like yeah you can kind of see why like

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,920
this is a little more useable like

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,320
there's a taxonomy I can click on things

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,750
that I can do and like what is over here

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,369
and they had this amazing thing called

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,409
like keywords so like if I was like hey

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:42,630
I have this awesome website so you type

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:44,100
like HTTP colon slash slash and like the

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,210
browser's were dumb they would not fill

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,829
this in for you and and then uh Oprah

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,149
like every day on her show would get up

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,720
there and Oprah would be like yes

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,790
keyword Oprah look it up on AOL and then

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,920
you get all this content from Oprah on

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,700
AOL like of course this is gonna win

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,040
Oprah is gonna win we're not gonna win

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,229
and just like I'm generally better

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,479
experience but the thing that ended up

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,060
happening is that the web had this thing

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,560
called URLs and then people who publish

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,110
them

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,940
would link to other people's URLs and

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,080
that seems like a really simple thing

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,930
and it's like this primitive that we

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,569
really take for granted but like the if

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,370
you wanted to publish something on AOL

00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:29,000
your first step was like be Oprah and

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,610
then step two was like pay people to put

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,260
up content on the web like anybody can

00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,459
get an earl and you can put up stuff and

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,040
then you can link to other people's

00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:40,370
stuff and even though worlds were much

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,230
worse to stay than keywords they allow

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,310
these kinds of network effects to happen

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,830
because you can link to other people's

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,180
stuff so like I make my Oprah blog we

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,950
didn't have blogs in the 90s but you get

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,269
my point

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,920
and then like somebody like publishes

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,450
their list of favorite Oprah sites and

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,700
somebody makes an Oprah web ring and

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,680
this all kind of piles on together and

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,019
eventually what you end up with is this

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,620
big network graph of different people

00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:07,310
providing different content and so Oprah

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,080
is content on a o L was a lot better

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,600
than like any one person's favorite

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,640
blogs or anything like that but when you

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,319
take the entire value of this big

00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,489
network and all this activity that's

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,959
happening and all this exponential

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,670
growth of this network around all that

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,350
content it just doesn't even compare

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,329
anymore to the content that you had

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,400
inside of these portals and so these

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:28,130
network effects are effectively why the

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,410
web one and when we when we go to

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,209
compare the value of AOL and all just

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,310
like really high end well published

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:37,010
content we're comparing it to this the

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,140
value of the web which is like this huge

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,920
exponentially growing graph of data and

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:45,290
value that's why the web one and I think

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,790
that is really easy today to forget

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,820
about these primitives and why they were

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,380
so important we really need to unwind

00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,910
our view of the web today when we think

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,950
about the web we think about standards

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,870
and browsers and web frameworks and

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,600
JavaScript and like that is all very

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,489
important and like I you know I did no

00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,680
js' stuff for nine years I think that

00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,630
like javascript is very important I

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,019
serve on the node foundation it is a

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,549
very important thing but if we're

00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:13,100
thinking about what are the current

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,630
limitations of the web and what are the

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,609
primitives that we need in order to move

00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,440
forward we really need to come back to

00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:22,060
the basics and unwind and think about

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,470
URLs and links so this is an earl and

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,810
there's basically three distinct parts

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,090
there's a transport

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,190
and authority and then a reference to

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,590
the content they're getting and you can

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,960
sort of think about this backwards right

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,400
first you name content that you're going

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,950
to publish so you create some kind of

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,740
name for it or like an index then

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:44,110
there's the who who do I ask for on the

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,360
internet for this content right and then

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,730
the transport says like how I ask this

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,530
person for that content and so when I

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,090
link to somebody else's site I'm

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,889
actually giving them a central location

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,960
to go and look this up I'm saying go to

00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:58,360
this authority and ask somebody for this

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,370
content right and that's that's the base

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,460
primitive that we built everything for

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,350
the last 20 years on centralization is

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,050
baked into that primitive right

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,360
it's federated in in a general sense but

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,220
like the whole web is federated but

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,220
every individual actor is actually

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,540
centralized so web locations are more

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,750
than just static assets in the browser

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,400
right static assets in the browser I can

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,620
manipulate they're part of the open web

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,750
like I can and do change like everything

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,740
in facebook

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,979
sorry I don't really go to Facebook but

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,690
Twitter like I remove all the ads I

00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:33,460
change words that make me stressed out

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,470
like Trump to things that don't stress

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,850
me out like daisies like it's just you

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,200
know I have like a series of dumb

00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,630
extensions to just change everything

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,700
about that experience the problem though

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,020
is that like Twitter and and modern web

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,700
applications in general aren't just

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,990
these static assets they pull

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,820
information out of AP eyes and those AP

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,590
eyes are addressed by those URLs they're

00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,910
like in these central locations I can't

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,470
just replace it the way that I can

00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,740
replace stuff that's in my browser and

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:02,470
so this means that data centralization

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,780
is baked in to multi-user applications

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,180
on the web today there just isn't a good

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,160
way for me to go and build an

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,160
application that multiple users interact

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,600
with and have relationships between

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,460
those peoples data without just

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,830
centralizing in an entire content silo

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,930
and putting an API in front of it so

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,370
this is one of the largest cost drivers

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,950
of modern applications it makes them

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,479
expensive like Brian's talking at the

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,340
beginning of the day was brilliant

00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,169
because you know it really is pennies

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,150
now to just run thousands of function

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,830
executions in the cloud but if you log

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,400
like a little bit of data from all of

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,040
those calls the storage cost of the

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,080
is more expensive than the processing of

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,639
the actual cloud functions storage

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,190
actually still does cost money and

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,320
unlike lot functions that like Evan flow

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,300
with like how active your website is

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,400
storage only really increases over time

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:56,280
it's why it's such a good business to be

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,470
in like we're here so but the the

00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,050
biggest problem that we really have with

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,520
with these data silos isn't just it like

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,380
we can't get our data out of them or

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,080
that they're opaque which they are it's

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,630
that they you have to basically build an

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,419
ad model to support most large websites

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:15,360
and that again comes back to URLs and

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:17,190
links if I want to benefit from the

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,440
network effects of the web I have to be

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,669
a link you to my content which means

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,860
that my content has to be publicly

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,440
accessible it can't be behind a paywall

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,030
so like any application that gets

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,979
popular enough through these network

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,060
effects is gonna have to be ad supported

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:34,770
in order to fund all these costs

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,180
eventually these a driven businesses

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,349
started to get smarter and smarter they

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,880
started to adopt a lot of really good

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,680
machine learning and new algorithms and

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,300
eventually what they figured out is that

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,400
the best way to capture your attention

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,960
for the longest amount of time is to

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,660
keep moving you towards more and more

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,699
extreme content and so you're

00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,440
effectively radicalizing people like on

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,440
purpose because it's a very good way to

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,720
keep you watching YouTube like forever

00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,270
and our current like we don't we just

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,620
have no recourse right like the people

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,389
in this room are developers like me

00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,940
we're going to build the next version of

00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,830
one of these applications and we have no

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,419
other tool than to build it the same way

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,370
that we've always built it and end up

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:13,169
with all the exact same problems again

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,729
our only other resources literally to

00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:16,289
yell at billionaires and try to ask them

00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:17,849
to change their algorithms to make less

00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,770
money like they didn't become

00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:20,970
billionaires by making less money off of

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:27,750
these algorithms is just not gonna

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:29,400
happen so anyway let's like so like how

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,680
do we even start to address this problem

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,940
it seems like very very like huge and it

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,190
is I've spent like 10 years trying to

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,900
think about it and here's the real issue

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,390
right so we have a web application it

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,310
talks to like multiple api's those api

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,320
is end up talking to databases and other

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,000
storage solutions and like I've written

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,370
databases like a bunch of them from

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,690
quite a while now and what a database

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,700
does really is that it take

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,820
the serialization of like your data

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,470
structure and then it stores it on disk

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,240
and it stores it on disk with a bunch of

00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,980
other computers usually in a network and

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,350
it makes guarantees about the state of

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,340
that data the thing that you you

00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,570
probably don't even realize as a

00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,760
developer because you kind of take it

00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,800
for granted is that there are state

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,650
guarantees and consistency guarantees in

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,080
that serialization to disk that bubble

00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,640
all the way up to the API and the state

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,900
that comes out then and then all the

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,480
caching layers that we build on those

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,640
api is to make them fast and so if we

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,140
want to like remove this API layer that

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,850
is so problematic and figure out how to

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,770
distribute it and decentralize that and

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,290
make it part of the open web we actually

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,090
have to go and dig all the way into

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,210
where that data gets serialized and

00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,700
bring that into like into the browser

00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,710
into the open web into a space that we

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,360
can actually work with so this will

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,240
become a little bit clearer as as I as I

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,040
move along but that's why we have to dig

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,290
so deep into this problem is because you

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,820
all of these layers in between have

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,590
consistency guarantees that bubble level

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,020
all the way from how you store data we

00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,730
have to literally start to rethink what

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,940
happened when we have a data structure

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,710
in memory and we need to share it or to

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,300
serialize it long term like what happens

00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,220
when it leaves the space of the memory

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,020
of our programs that's the problem we

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,210
need to solve so we come back to the

00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,620
Earle like we did the Earle has a

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,390
central authority in it we're gonna have

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,390
all the same problems so like to get rid

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,940
of the transport and the authority also

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,040
because we don't have an authority we

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,050
don't have like like the authority also

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,630
provides a namespace so we can't have

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:28,410
like these human names we go and create

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:29,670
the things we can do so eventually

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,400
people figure it out that you can do

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,290
this thing where you hash the content

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,620
and people have been using hashes for

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,720
very long time but every five years or

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,250
so we look at hashing and we realized

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,170
that there's like another problem that

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,640
we can solve with this and another whole

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,170
scope of issues that we can solve with

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,339
it and so our view of what we can do

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,330
with Cooper graphic hashing keeps

00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,130
getting bigger and bigger and bigger

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:54,720
right and promise I'm not going to talk

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:56,670
about block chains so we we have so what

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,810
we have this primitive now called

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,320
content address ability or content

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:05,500
dressing right and the interesting thing

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,220
about content addressability is that we

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,380
get a way to address data without an

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,790
authority without a location without a

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,740
transport we can get the data from

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,180
anywhere from anybody and we have a

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,130
cryptographic guarantee that like you

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:22,510
told me about this hash and I got it

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:24,310
from like some Rando and I looked at the

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,100
data and said Oh ad does match this hash

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,750
it's kind of brilliant and then if that

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:32,200
data has inside of it

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,000
other hashes then changing any of those

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,110
links inside of that data changes the

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,520
hash and so we have another

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:42,700
cryptographic guarantee if the day ever

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:44,020
changes I'm just gonna move along and

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,690
start to show some of this in practice

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,070
at this point because either you're

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,380
following along or you're not and you're

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:54,520
not gonna get it if I keep just talking

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:56,500
okay so a protocol out we created this

00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,960
thing called a CID or content identifier

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,060
so CID is just a very very flexible way

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,650
to say okay we have we have a hash and

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,540
then we need to know how to interpret

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,770
that hash to get links out of it because

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,170
we're not all going to use the exact

00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,640
same data format so that's all it is so

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,100
you can think of it as like sort of like

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:15,640
a replacement for the earldom to graphic

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,770
hashing okay so if I want to like you

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,570
know publish my blog data and you want

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,970
to go read it you would say oh go get

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,589
this this content hash and then you

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,380
would get back this object it has my

00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:28,360
posts in it okay and here's here's the

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,820
fun thing it just doesn't matter how you

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,900
get this hash right like I'm not gonna

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,060
talk about a bunch of peer-to-peer

00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,280
technologies and dhts and ways to get it

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,600
data because it literally doesn't matter

00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,860
you could pull it out of a centralized

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,250
store you could pull it out of a local

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:45,160
storage cache like anyway the nobody

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,600
cares like it's all you know the same

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,280
for together guarantees so this is how

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,630
we can create truly decentralized data

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,640
structures without worrying about like

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,839
oh well did I authenticate with the

00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,690
right peer-to-peer network and things

00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,279
like that anyway inside of this data

00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,560
structure I have a list of posts and

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,800
then one of those posts just points to

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,779
another cid it's just a link right we're

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,910
just creating new link data just like we

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:10,430
did in the internet and then when I go

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:12,980
and get that C ID from wherever again

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,470
I will then get the text for that post

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,009
fairly simple okay

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,690
but now Sally like has a list of her

00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:22,339
favorite blogs and she's like oh yeah

00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,660
well Michels blog is this hash so boom

00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:25,610
that's in my list I'm not publishing

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,410
that data and Heather creates an

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,360
aggregator and she's like oh cool

00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,440
there's this new link now and now we're

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,899
starting to build some of the same

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,529
network effects that we had in the early

00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,819
web with links for data so all of my

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:39,440
data that I publish all my tweets

00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:40,970
they're not just like locked up in

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,680
Twitter or locked up in Facebook or

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,899
wherever they're actually part of like a

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,250
completely decentralized system that

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:48,800
spans the internet where anybody can

00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,319
link to anybody's data so the really

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,910
cool thing here is like different people

00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:54,279
can be hosting this data right it

00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,810
doesn't have to live in the same place

00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:58,399
if I'm only looking at Heather's

00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,930
aggregator and I don't really want to go

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,380
look at my blog I don't even have to

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:05,420
resolve that link or all of this could

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,709
be on my computer because I pulled it

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,410
all down to read all of this data

00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:12,259
offline nothing changes in the data

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:14,209
structures it's all just content

00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:16,430
addressed okay so let's look at like a

00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:18,350
more kind of real-world use case so

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,620
different universities published in

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,690
omics data different scientific data and

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,880
then people run regression analysis over

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,100
that data the way this looks today is

00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,380
that they publish it in like just random

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,279
different FTP sites and tarballs and

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,660
stuff and then everybody goes and

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,980
downloads that and like different

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,910
universities try to mirror each other's

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,740
data but they all use different

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,040
protocols and it's like really really

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,630
messy so if we if we imagine this world

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,430
where we have content address data and

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,769
that you actually put all of that

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,480
genomics data into content dress that I

00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:50,449
can create a regression data set that is

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,709
also a hash they just point to all the

00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:52,910
hashes that I'm going to run against

00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:55,760
right at all of these different places

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:58,189
and I can pull all of that data down in

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,319
real time from all of these universities

00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:02,930
or mirrors of those universities or

00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:04,490
local caches again all of the sort of

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,189
deliverability semantics are then

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,050
removed from the data structures so we

00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:10,790
get a lot more reliability we get a lot

00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,670
more permanence and like archive ability

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,810
which is really important and then the

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,430
really cool thing is that when I get

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,860
that result that regression result that

00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,959
ran across that entire data set I can

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,360
point down at individual parts of the

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,810
data right like the same way that you

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,190
would put

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,290
like look down and look at individual

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,610
posts I can look at you know this is

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,430
just a part of the genomics data that

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,920
match some query that I had and again I

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,260
can pull down all that data and riho

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,340
stit and republish it but actually my

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,690
data structure is the only thing that I

00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,550
worry about need to worry about being

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,500
published and staying alive all of these

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,029
links they go off to other places those

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,100
are in the network those exist I don't

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:49,220
have to Rijo s-- them I'm just adding

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,510
new value to or and also deriving value

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,529
from the data that's in the network

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,790
similarly like let's imagine like a

00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,520
Twitter that's built on you centralized

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,589
data structures so Bob Alice and Sally

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,410
and Heather are all publishing their

00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:05,089
feeds somewhere and my feed is just a

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,950
pointer to all of their feeds that's

00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,740
what I'm looking at right and my

00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:11,420
favorites is just pointing to all the

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,310
individual treats inside of their data

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,410
structures and now they're hosting them

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,380
or I'm hosting them or it doesn't matter

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,089
right that's kind of the point and of

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,060
course this data structure is the exact

00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:24,380
this looks exactly like a slide from a

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,140
little bit ago even though these data

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,670
structures are completely different like

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,900
the way that we would want to do you

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,550
know genomics data and the way that we

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,500
would do tweets looks very different

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,290
from like you know the actual data

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,760
structures point of view but I'm able to

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,560
display it in the same way here because

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,720
it's all built on this same really

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:46,550
really tiny primitive this continent in

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,920
the fire so CID is a pointer that spans

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,210
the internet essentially you can think

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,470
about it like when you're building data

00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,970
structures and you're building B trees

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,930
like if you've you know had a Google

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:59,210
interview and then never done that again

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:01,640
you you have pointers to data it's like

00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,839
a very simple programming concept but if

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,220
you think about a pointer that can span

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,689
the internet then now you can imagine

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,089
building out data structures like B

00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:09,650
trees that span more than just you know

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,709
the memory space inside of my hard drive

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,750
and also don't just span you know a

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,920
particular data silo for a particular

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:21,890
website as quote as me I said done smart

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:24,829
so so but at the end of the day what we

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,199
end up with is a network of data this

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:29,270
hugely giant valuable network of data

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,760
write effectively like an Internet of

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,820
data just built on this simple primitive

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,640
right

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,110
now if you start to imagine all this

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,710
data out there existing all these people

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:44,890
building value on top of it you stop

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:48,280
trying to compare this to a particular

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,630
Amazon offering or this to Facebook or

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,660
this to Twitter right

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,160
those are huge applications it's hard to

00:17:52,660 --> 00:18:00,010
imagine anybody ever competing with them

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:02,620
but just like my a hotel blog was not

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:05,230
competing or sorry my Oprah blog was not

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,940
competing with Oprah's content the whole

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,010
network was competing with that content

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,270
in the same way if we're creating this

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,580
internet a data and deriving all of this

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,080
value those old applications that are

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,700
locked up in data silos are actually

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,340
competing with the entire value of the

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,200
network that means that we can actually

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,300
win we can actually like move all of

00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,070
this data and start moving our next

00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,800
application basis all into this new

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,150
model where we're not locked up in all

00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,910
these companies and all these data silos

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,680
anymore so that's the vision that we

00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,270
have that we're trying to build I'm

00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,110
working on that a protocol labs a lot of

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,460
people are working on this a lot of

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:39,820
people are working looking at content or

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,460
disability where it's like the earliest

00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,080
days ever like we are still implementing

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,180
fundamental data structures we're doing

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,890
a lot of new research and new work if

00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,560
you're really interested in this I would

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,480
like really encourage you to go check

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,280
out this spec repository this is

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,400
probably like the best list of grammar

00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,990
and current work that we have like in

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,610
like a more human readable format and

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,770
we're of course working in like a lot of

00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,390
new content and then on top of these

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,970
data structures we built things like IP

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,410
FS the interplanetary file system which

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,910
can move your files around and all of

00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,830
that I peeled d stands for

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:15,490
interplanetary linked data yeah because

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:17,770
we we love acronyms that immediately

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,880
make the intergalactic sonbai Beastie

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:24,490
Boys playing my head so but anyway that

00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,900
that is my talk I finished up a little

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,000
bit early very nice I always talked

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,700
faster than I wanted to so thank you so

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,650
much and please join us on making the

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:39,920
next version of the web

00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:39,920
