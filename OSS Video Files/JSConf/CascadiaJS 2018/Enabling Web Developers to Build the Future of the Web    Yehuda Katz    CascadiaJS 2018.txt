I guess I keeping with the title on the

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,759
on the schedule it's a surprise talk

00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,250
what I really wanted to sorry so this is

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,839
the first talk I've been given I'm

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,690
giving in a pretty long time in large

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,380
part because I had a baby and I realized

00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,820
standing in front of you right now I

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,350
should probably put pictures of my baby

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,369
in the slides did not do that

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,590
great apologies but so it's my first

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,510
talk in a while and that has given me

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,270
some time to reflect on on some things

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,180
and so the the talk was called surprise

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,890
talk and I asked a few times the the

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,850
people who run this conference like what

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,260
do you want me to talk about and they

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,170
said like really whatever you want to

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,250
want to talk about and of course that

00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,260
indeed gave me a lot of time to reflect

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,719
on what I should talk about usually it

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,570
helps to have some starting point as DHH

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,770
says constraints are liberating but

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,949
something happened this week that

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,320
actually got me thinking so tom tweeted

00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,309
that he wrote this post asking Google

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,260
for better engagement with web

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,670
frameworks in 2016 and this week they

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:08,130
delivered on my entire wish list I'm

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,780
truly over the moon and Benedict tweeted

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,430
for those of you who haven't checked out

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,049
the dev summit keynote by multi-and and

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,820
nicole frameworks are considered

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,380
first-class citizens now which maybe

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,240
would be surprised everyone in this room

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,930
who probably uses frameworks like what

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,189
does it mean that they're not

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,430
first-class citizens that seems like a

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,920
surprising piece of news and there will

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,840
not be close collaboration between web

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,720
platform of frameworks how cool is that

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,880
and so I realized thinking about like

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,710
how do you explain what it means that

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,909
frameworks are now for the first time

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,909
considered first-class citizens

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,159
according to chrome what does that mean

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,649
I got me thinking about like what my

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,770
personal journey was in getting involved

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,930
in web standards and I want to start

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,030
with a disclaimer there's like a large

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,560
number of people who were involved in a

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,969
lot of this story that I'm about to tell

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,490
you and I could have spent the entire

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:03,600
time giving credit and thanking a lot of

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,670
people who were part of all those part

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,479
of all those moments unfortunately I

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,180
only have 25 minutes and I really know

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,650
my own like my own anecdotes better than

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,810
everyone else

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,909
so I apologize up front for the fact

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,220
that this is gonna end up kind of being

00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:21,470
myopic from my own perspective but

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:28,870
hopefully my perspective is helpful or

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:33,260
useful in some way so I started

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:39,290
programming in 2005 which was I guess

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:41,030
pretty late and I was I was just being

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,610
up I was an open source person pretty

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,410
early and didn't really get involved in

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,120
any kind of like standards work or any

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:51,470
like very serious open source work until

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,629
like 2008 or 2009 when I ended up

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,030
getting on the rails core team by

00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:57,440
building a competitor to rails having it

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,079
be successful and then us getting

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,720
together and singing Kumbaya and merging

00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,430
the two things together so I was pretty

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,970
busy up until that point like trying to

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,530
figure out how open-source worked and

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,810
for some reason like largely because

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,280
jQuery didn't have good Doc's I also

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,129
ended up being on the jQuery core team

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,680
around the same time period so in

00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,690
retrospect that was a pretty early time

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,160
in my career to be on both of the core

00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,730
teams but it's just where I was at at

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,859
the time and so I was kind of pretty

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,829
aware of how open-source worked how web

00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:33,139
developers did use things like jQuery

00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:35,379
and Rails but pretty unaware of how like

00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:40,489
the wider programming ecosystem worked

00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:41,690
and I started thinking because I've been

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,370
working on jQuery and I've been working

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,109
on rails and you know if you're working

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,459
on jQuery you like interact with the Dom

00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:48,470
a lot if you working on Rails you

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:51,440
interact with like the HTML and the and

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,699
the HTTP spec a lot and occasionally I

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,769
would go into a spec to try to figure

00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,209
out like what is it talking about and I

00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,650
would it would be like really hard to

00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,989
understand what's happening and so I

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,970
asked myself like why why is it so hard

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,560
like why is it that if I want to

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,560
understand something it's really hard to

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,359
understand and I started asking around

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,579
like other people in web standards like

00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:12,410
hey why like what's so hard and they

00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,849
said well why not like we are very

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,579
enthusiastic to hear your feedback why

00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:18,769
don't you give us some feedback so I

00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,989
took a look at web IDL which if anybody

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,950
is aware of probably not the best place

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,480
to have started but as I said in my

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,950
this is my really my first standards

00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,140
mailing list post ever I said at the

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,670
urging of some folks because people

00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,230
claim they really want my feedback I've

00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:37,000
poked around and I have some feedback

00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:39,130
and really my first post ever was like

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,020
I'm finding it difficult to understand

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,730
like I don't understand how to how to

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,230
use it and I think there are other

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:49,090
people in the world who are not me who

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:51,160
also have that same problem and the

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,960
response that I got back in 2009 was

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,910
it's a word I said don't we agree that

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,500
it's a worthy goal to actually have

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,600
aspect that people can understand and

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,160
the response I got was it's a worthy

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,200
goal but it won't be possible to make it

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,340
so everyone who finds it so that

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,930
everyone finds it easy and quick to

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,820
understand the current syntax is not

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,260
familiar to only to implementers but

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,700
basically anybody who's already doing

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:15,760
specs already understands it so like

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:17,590
sorry you're out of luck so sort of what

00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,560
I took away from that conversation in

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,740
2009 is like specs are for implementers

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,360
and they're for specs what they should

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,150
do is prioritize being understood by

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,780
people who already understand specs

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,520
unfortunately this is a bit of a

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,930
circular problem it will mean that

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,450
people can stick around for a long time

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,340
and they will continue to elevate

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,930
themselves in the in the group of people

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,950
understand specs but nobody can get in

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,210
for the first time unless you're like a

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,520
dedicating a lot of time to it because

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,680
your implement or something and I

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,360
realized at the time that there's kind

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,760
of a structural problem here which is

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,620
that when the web creates a new feature

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,350
how does it get introduced in 2009 it

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,850
got introduced as a spec and they're

00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,930
telling everybody like hey you know it

00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,030
would be great it would be great if

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,730
everybody all the web developers gave us

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,200
feedback about these specs but then they

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,190
also tell you oh but the spec is not for

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,570
you you're not supposed to read specs

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,740
and we're not even really interested in

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,330
making it easier for you to understand

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:16,390
so basically my my summary again at the

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,070
time was basically if spec authors

00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,930
reject the idea of making specs more

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,880
accessible to web developers and they

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,500
also require new feedback in terms of

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,470
specs then we're just cut out of the

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,740
process and sort of how I felt about

00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:33,430
that in 2009 was like that like it's not

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:36,130
fair and then like maybe little

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,420
righteously angry little like this is

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,220
really not fair

00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,710
but I think at the end of the day in

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,250
2009 I was like a programmer for four

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,630
years

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:47,740
I got enthusiastic idea in the first

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,420
place like you should go in and give us

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,770
feedback I gave some feedback I was

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,160
basically told this whole process is not

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:59,770
really for you so I kind of just like

00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:01,480
went away for a bit and I would say that

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,490
I it was like oh well I actually do know

00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,920
how to make rails and jQuery so like

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,670
I'll just work on that and I continued

00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,660
to do that for a little while

00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,430
another thing that sort of happened at

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,810
the same time that was given like a

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,940
little bit after that which gave me some

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,860
perspective was that John Resig who I

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,380
looked up to him was like clearly not a

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,840
new programmer at the time who created

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,550
jQuery was like oh it's you know would

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,530
be great it would really be great if the

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,850
Dom was as good as jQuery and there's

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,950
just no reason why that couldn't be the

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,040
case so he wrote a proposal which was

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,210
the Dom node list API that was if you

00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,550
look at the date on this it says eight

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,530
years ago and many parts of this are

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:43,930
still not implemented or even in

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:46,330
proposal form and basically me watching

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,160
John not really succeed at getting the

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,960
spanish process to take this proposal

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,010
seriously which if you look at it says

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,230
you can run the test suite it has a

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,700
thousand plus tests right so like

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,870
clearly he had done like really the

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,360
maximum amount of work that you could

00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,680
possibly imagine to propose and it

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,450
wasn't really working so I was like

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,680
starting to feel like there's the

00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,110
structural problem might be like pretty

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,790
serious it's not just me it's not just

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,060
I'm a new programmer but there might be

00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:12,310
some serious structural issues and like

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,620
as I sort of wrapped up working on rails

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,330
3 and like poked my head back up again

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,280
and like felt like well there's still

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,970
not a ton of people involved in web

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,980
specs like I kind of like my takeaway

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,990
the first time was it's really unfair

00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,360
but like maybe I'm just overwrought

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,310
ating maybe it's like a personal thing I

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,220
eat maybe I'm making people upset or

00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,290
maybe I'm just too green I'm too much of

00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,550
a noob but like I came back and like oh

00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,200
it seems like people are claiming that

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,150
they're very enthusiastic about it so

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,380
probably now that people claim they're

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,880
very enthusiastic if I wait a little

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,370
while people will actually get involved

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,740
but what ended up happening was I waited

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,700
a few years finished up my other project

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,310
and notice that there still nobody

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,840
really involved in web specs

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,310
and I should say there are there are a

00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,290
handful of people who were very involved

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,210
I think leav Errol is an example

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,210
somebody who I look up to a lot and was

00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,410
like involved very early and these are

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:05,370
people who basically put up with an

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,980
extreme amount of frustration in order

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,080
to to participate and I'm not meaning to

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,250
take away from their participation I'm

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,360
just meaning to say that there weren't a

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:18,270
ton of people involved at the time so

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,620
I'm like thinking about this and chrome

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,480
actually came out around the same time

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,700
right so before chrome there was like

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,860
Firefox and ie ie had no standards

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,770
Firefox had this like kind of lumbering

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,750
old standards participation process and

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:35,190
like kind of a lumbering old codebase

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,900
and chrome came out and like looked like

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,600
there was some enthusiasm for maybe

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,690
doing things differently than in the

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,490
past in particular like Paul Irish who

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:48,930
was kind of like a enthusiastic

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,430
developer evangelist before he joined

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,170
Google joined Google and became

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,410
enthusiastic developer evangelist at

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,820
Google and like Paul and I were both on

00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,260
the jQuery team and we talked a lot

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,600
about like what can we do about this

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,620
like this problem seems bad it seems

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,970
like something we should do about it

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,589
like what can we do about it

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:09,270
and the first thing we said is like well

00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:11,370
maybe if we like DDoS the spanish

00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,780
process with a lot of feedback maybe

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,670
they will notice that there is more

00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,930
feedback than they thought because one

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,850
of the things that people said at the

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,680
time was there just aren't that many

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,210
people who are like really capable of

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,950
understanding enough to give good

00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,320
feedback they would say like oh you guys

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,540
are just not really capable of this so

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,910
we said well maybe we could just like

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,310
show empirically that that's not true

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,140
so I tweeted this thing that said like

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:39,930
what is the one browser bug you could

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:41,070
fix know what is the one browser bug you

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,420
could fix or feature you can add

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,530
significantly to improve what you can

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,050
build on the web and basically the idea

00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,029
was they like the browser vendors and

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,470
spec authors their perspective at the

00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:52,170
time was like you need to understand

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,850
very very elaborate things in order to

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,709
give feedback but actually this question

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,570
is probably the right question to ask if

00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:02,580
you want to figure out what to do so let

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:04,110
me ask that question and Paul wrote a

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,670
blog post right afterwards

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,400
the feedback end you can see him we got

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,260
a great response 230 plus responses and

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,850
I was pretty shocked actually at the

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,080
time this is like 2009 I don't even know

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,230
how many people were on Twitter at the

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,530
time or 2011 but that was like a lot of

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,360
responses to get and I embedded an

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,250
iframe here because I couldn't think of

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,620
a better way of giving a sense of the

00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,720
amount of responses that we got but

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,440
there were a lot of responses that were

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,150
actually pretty good it's actually a

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,590
good list to go back to now because I'll

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:39,900
surprising amount of this is not done

00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:44,430
I'm still scrolling so anyway we I like

00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:46,050
I like this one is this so we were

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,300
basically like maybe we can like

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,820
illustrate directly that there is a huge

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,770
amount of enthusiasm for things that are

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,020
just being ignored because basically the

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,640
idea that people can't get feedback was

00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,740
resulting in a lack of representation

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,110
from of web developers which was

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:07,350
resulting in web developer interest just

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:11,670
not being that considered so I we did

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:13,470
that and like people noticed and I me

00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,430
and Paul were like well we just we

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,150
really need to show up and actually

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:20,010
start like banging the gong but we had

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,980
this problem the problem that I said

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:26,190
before which is that if fundamentally if

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,990
spec authors are like you were not

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,910
willing to make specs more accessible to

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,970
web developers and we think that's

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:35,400
actually a bug it's like a non non goal

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,770
on the other hand all this all the specs

00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,660
are coming out as specs all the proposed

00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,830
are coming out of specs we're cut out it

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,220
actually seems like structurally there's

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:48,060
a problem so the good news about this is

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,220
that thinking back on this like in 2011

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:53,520
I realized that chrome really changed

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,840
things among other things like standards

00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,300
bodies even though they hadn't really

00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,160
grappled with the consequences of the

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,110
problem were like very convinced that

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,020
they wanted more developer involvement

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,370
and they were still repeating like

00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,990
developers aren't don't have time for

00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,340
this kind of grunt work or like people

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,720
aren't capable or whatever but

00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,250
ultimately if you ask them people were

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,250
like very enthusiastic about the idea of

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,870
getting more help and also another

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,259
subtle thing that happened was that the

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,869
chrome

00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:22,139
team brought in a lot of ex web

00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:24,239
developers so people like like Alex

00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,279
Russell who worked on dojo was now like

00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:27,959
a person working on the C++ part of

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,179
Chrome so and that there were a bunch of

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:33,029
people doing that so there was

00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:34,199
definitely a sense in which there was a

00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:36,179
little bit of representation on the

00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:37,679
chrome team mostly of people who used to

00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:39,299
be web developers but there were you

00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,729
still like remember something about it

00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:46,019
and there was more motivation to do

00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:48,029
something so kind of looked at it and I

00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,489
was like well I guess it's time to crash

00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:51,899
the gates basically we were probably a

00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:53,989
little over enthusiastic about what we

00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,910
could do but I think we we felt like

00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:59,209
basically the time is now like we did

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,259
this huge survey there's like a

00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:03,359
surprising amount of things that people

00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,679
want done that aren't getting done like

00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:08,369
we should try to do something about it

00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:11,009
and the first thing that we did was we

00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:13,199
joined tc39 so at the time there were

00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:15,539
zero people on Tizen 39 who worked on

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,479
who brought javascript or web software

00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:20,839
for a living it was either like I would

00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:23,129
say academics or theoreticians or

00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:27,569
implementers of web browsers but zero

00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:29,489
web developers on tc39 at all and today

00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:33,779
that's not true and I'll talk about that

00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:35,009
as I go on but at the time like one of

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,119
the reasons that nobody was joining was

00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:38,429
that there was a sense like oh you have

00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:39,749
to pay to join tc39 so like how can you

00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:42,679
join obviously I don't have the money to

00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:44,999
join a pay-for-play organization and

00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:48,989
turns out that if you look at the rules

00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:51,179
of tc39 not-for-profit organizations are

00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:52,829
allowed to join for no fee and the

00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:54,749
jQuery foundation which was the group

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:56,459
that Paul and I were involved in at the

00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:58,589
time trying to do something about this

00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:01,399
was a registered nonprofit so we were

00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:06,149
able to join and we were able to become

00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:08,159
members now I think ACMA immediately was

00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:11,369
like oh that seems like a very big

00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,079
loophole but I think ultimately nobody

00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:15,209
wanted to say like jQuery is not allowed

00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,779
to be on tc39 like we followed the rules

00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:20,759
and I think that was more or less good

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:22,769
enough for for them and I think that

00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,359
basically one of the takeaways I had was

00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:27,059
like really pay attention to when people

00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:27,910
say you can't do that because XYZ you

00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,200
can't join TZ

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,000
because it will be too expensive like

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,640
like really investigate whether that's

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,420
true

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,160
and after joining T's 39 and becoming I

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,170
joined with Rick Waldron we became the

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,130
first two people who were web developers

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:48,240
of Tizen 39 I ran with a few people to

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:51,850
reform the w3c tag which is like the

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,800
steering committee I guess of w3c and

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,480
like I said a bunch of stuff it's like

00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,180
probably cool blog posts to still read

00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,180
at some point I made jokes about RFC's

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:09,460
but and and after running we won so for

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,830
four people ran on the idea of actually

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,950
getting more involvement about the

00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:17,020
regular day-to-day so tc39 had problems

00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,640
but the w3c at the time was full of

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,440
people who thought that the web the job

00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,850
of a web standards body was the Semantic

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,950
Web which has nothing to do with the web

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,280
as we in this room understand it so

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:29,020
there was a big project there of like

00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,870
resuscitating the w3c s core

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,910
architectural ideas around web

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,650
architecture and not around semantic web

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:40,720
architecture which only is the same

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:42,340
thing only in name only and like one of

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,920
the things I noticed when we joined was

00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,890
like the tags phil was using CVS at the

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,390
time not not SPN like some of us might

00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,860
remember hats they were literally using

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,980
CVS so I had to get like a CVS

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,810
accountant whatever and one of the first

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,240
things that we did was like just put the

00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,130
tag on github and like you'd be

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,500
surprised at how controversial that was

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,660
but it was actually a big deal because

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,640
it may amend that there was a way that

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,310
people understood how to participate in

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,100
the process like get up issues and pull

00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,870
requests that people found familiar that

00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,710
was now how you also interacted with

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,430
what was frankly a pretty stodgy

00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,260
organization that had nothing to do with

00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,700
your needs right but if the only way to

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,740
participate before was like mailing

00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:27,700
lists and CVS like good luck but if you

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:31,090
can file issues that helps but there was

00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:33,160
still this problem so sort of the idea

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,540
was like we need to we need first we

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,520
need to have representation so like we

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,690
can if we want to reform any of the

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,250
structural problems we actually need to

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,820
be there and like in the place where

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,490
you're supposed to be to

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,980
we make the proposals but there was

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,299
still this issue of like functionally

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,429
this is not a rule anywhere but

00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,679
functionally the way the web standards

00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:56,500
feedback loop worked functionally cut

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:59,389
out web developers and I realized that

00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:03,169
because of them the moment that we that

00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:05,960
that was in we were able to we were able

00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,580
to really change how we thought about it

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,320
and I think if you think about it today

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,350
that problem doesn't exist anymore and

00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,960
one of the big watershed moments was I

00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:17,210
decided to reach out to all the people

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,090
involved in web standards who shared

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,730
basically a view of this problem and I

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,980
wrote this extensive web manifesto which

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,350
was then signed by a lot of people which

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,059
I'll show in a second but the key thing

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,669
that the extensible web manifesto said

00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,870
was it's actually pretty bold it says we

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:34,639
want to change our web standards

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,830
committees create and prioritize new

00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:37,850
features and importantly we want to

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,169
tighten the feedback loop between

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,000
editors and web standards and web

00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:42,830
developers so that if you if you ever

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,139
heard of this like it's probably worth

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,059
going back and reading but the key thing

00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:48,620
was we said we have a manifesto that

00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,799
says that we need to fix the structural

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:55,039
problem and like a cool thing about it

00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:57,379
was a lot of people signed it so again

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,179
because the moment was ripe for getting

00:18:57,379 --> 00:19:00,649
agreement on something a lot of people

00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,000
signed something that fundamentally said

00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:06,710
that the old structural problem was not

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,889
okay anymore so that that happened in

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,629
like 2013 and I could spend like another

00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:12,830
hours talking about all the things that

00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:15,500
happen in between because because

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:17,000
frankly once we got to a point where

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,620
there was a more appropriate feedback

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,389
loop I wouldn't say it was perfect by

00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,100
any means but there was like web

00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:24,440
developers are structurally allowed to

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,700
be in the conversation a lot of the next

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,769
like the story of the next five years is

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,210
like doing work like actually doing work

00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:32,000
and I think things like service worker

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,169
actually landed and that like the chrome

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,139
team gets a lot of credit for that

00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:37,669
but so do all the web developers who

00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:41,299
push back against app cache not working

00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:43,700
so well and really pushing hard on on a

00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:45,110
new feature and like helping people who

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,720
are motivated to do it

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,129
convince their colleagues right so a lot

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,340
of the work of the next few years it's

00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:54,419
really just like doing work but I wanted

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,239
so I'm gonna sort of skip ahead like

00:19:54,419 --> 00:20:01,529
boring doing work part and just talk

00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:03,509
about like by the by the by the numbers

00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:07,070
basically so first of all I want to say

00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:10,289
we thought a lot of work to do like

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,940
sorry in part in part because just like

00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:14,639
there's a lot always a lot more to do

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,440
but and also in part because the problem

00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:17,999
of under-representation and tech is not

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,679
limited to web developers there's a lot

00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:22,320
of groups that are underrepresented and

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,940
the benefits that we got from include

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,149
increasing the number of web developers

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,499
in standards bodies is are also the same

00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:29,789
as the benefits that you get from

00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:32,039
increasing participation of any

00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:33,149
underrepresented group for all the

00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,009
reasons that the previous talk was

00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,690
talking about so there's still a lot of

00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:38,730
work to just actually continue to

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,799
increase representation in standards and

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,710
it and I don't want to sugarcoat where

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,230
we're at so I want to say that but

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:50,369
overall the sentiment that we have right

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:53,879
now is much healthier and part of what

00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:55,649
that means is that we now try very hard

00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:57,600
at least in tc39 to co-locate our

00:20:55,649 --> 00:21:00,659
meetings with community events like J's

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,999
coffee you so that we can hold things

00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:09,509
like this this what was this thing

00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:11,399
called it was called a panel so we can

00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:14,460
hold panels and like basically everyone

00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:16,080
at J's coffee you got to ask committee

00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,999
members what they thought about various

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,460
in-flight features and like the general

00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:21,720
process and the group of people on the

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,139
stage here are actually pretty

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:28,080
representative of tc39 and largely are

00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:31,919
people doing day-to-day JavaScript work

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:35,249
and I think that's pretty great that I

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:39,210
also just need to call out if I'm gonna

00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:42,570
call it anybody here computer computer

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:44,159
okay dan has been doing a huge amount of

00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,080
work to try to just increase the amount

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,179
of feedback that tc39 gets so this is

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,840
like him giving a talk on like we want

00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:53,279
your help to make the next guest but

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,169
really what this what has been about is

00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,629
dan has been has poured a ton of time

00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:59,820
into creating community groups so

00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:01,859
there's an educator group a framework

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,749
group a transpiler group that is

00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:05,340
basically just getting feedback from

00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:07,470
groups of people that maybe don't have

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,360
time or money to join tc39

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,549
to travel but who have very useful

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,350
feedback and having regular meetings

00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:14,789
where those groups of people can give

00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,380
their feedback about proposals and

00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:20,070
actually bring that feedback back to

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,330
tc39 doing more of that has been

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,159
invaluable I think that's kind of the

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,559
next frontier at least 42:39 is like

00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,750
just making more of these not in the

00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:32,280
committee groups of people just to get

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:34,380
feedback funnels working and remember

00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,600
when I joined T's 39 in the first place

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,030
there were no web developers working on

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,710
tc39 there was the best we had was

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,330
people who used to be web developers or

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:46,260
on Tizen 39 but now today there are

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,549
JavaScript developers who work day to

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,620
day on JavaScript from big companies

00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:51,720
like Google and Facebook for small

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,340
companies like the one I work at Cavalia

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,929
and boku there's people who represent

00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,490
frameworks there's people who represent

00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:58,830
libraries there's people who represent

00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,330
compiled to JavaScript languages there's

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:03,360
people who represent transpilers like

00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,309
Babel there's now node joined and p.m.

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,360
join right so now we have like it used

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:12,330
to be zero in 2011 and now in 20 in 2018

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,799
it's really a very very robust group of

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:17,130
people representing a whole bunch of

00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:18,419
different parts of the ecosystem and it

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,159
just goes without saying that when you

00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:24,900
have this many groups of people involved

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,220
the kinds of objections that people have

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,419
when they just don't have JavaScript

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,490
developers in the room just don't go

00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:30,720
very far right so you could say you used

00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,460
to be able to say like oh I don't know

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,770
if anybody uses function declarations or

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,240
whatever and now if you say like people

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,590
like there actually was an argument that

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,120
like oh we should just switch to like

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,250
some other thing because no one uses

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,780
that feature or like AMD is good enough

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,150
to nobody we don't need Center modules

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,100
or whatever and like these days

00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,409
there's enough JavaScript developers

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,179
like frankly we we argue amongst each

00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:53,280
other like we have so many people that

00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:56,100
now like our now the the group of

00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,630
JavaScript practitioners is we're

00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,250
actually able to have debates amongst

00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:01,620
ourselves without feeling like like

00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,850
we're too small right so now there's

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,320
just a huge amount of JavaScript

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,030
developers representing a huge amount of

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,950
different interests on the committee and

00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:12,960
I think this has been like really the

00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:15,620
I'm very proud of this result going back

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,210
to the beginning of the story here

00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,159
beginning of this talk so one thing that

00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,690
was kind of sad that I skipped over in

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,420
between

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,010
2013 and 2018 is that browser developers

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,860
didn't always see web developers as

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:30,980
allies and part of the reason for that

00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:33,380
is that as mobile took off and browser

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,880
vendors got squeezed for performance

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,860
browser vendors would go look at like

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,510
why is the verge calm very slow and

00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,680
would say oh your javascript is terrible

00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,780
and you're using this like terrible

00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,490
framework with these terrible tools and

00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,750
like if only everybody just hand wrote

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,930
everything by hand everything would be

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:51,560
better and like that is a thing that

00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:54,530
people that is a thing that people would

00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,330
say so Alex in 2016 who co-signed

00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,860
extensible of manifesto and like points

00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,600
this out in this thread basically says

00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,890
like seriously folks it's time to throw

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,830
out your frameworks and see how fast the

00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:07,340
browser can be right and basically not -

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:09,400
not to say anything about Alex but there

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:13,400
was definitely even though we like got

00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:16,550
agreement across a lot of people about

00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,110
the extensible web manifesto what

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,120
started like there was a period of time

00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,610
where there was just not a very strong

00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,870
alliance between browser vendors and web

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,790
developers especially framework

00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,220
developers again I think a big part of

00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,660
that had to do with mobile squeezing

00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,250
browser vendors for performance they're

00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,480
hearing about it from people who say why

00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,390
is your browser so slow and they're

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,060
trying to figure out how to explain it

00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:39,320
and so that's why this thing that

00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,500
happened this week was so important so

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,670
Nicole got up on stage and said it's not

00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,130
that you should throw out your framework

00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,360
framework sometimes make apps lower but

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,410
they're also our best hope to make them

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,970
faster and multiple who made amp said

00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:55,520
that's a bold statement and she said yes

00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,470
that is a bold statement but the I think

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,600
the point is we're finally coming to the

00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:02,030
end of the story here where we're

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,210
finally coming back to us actually all

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,980
being in it together which I think was

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,330
we had it for a moment in 2013 and I

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,110
think we've kind of gone around the

00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:15,680
block a little so another thing just to

00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:17,360
just to give them credit is they're now

00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,470
including frameworks like the popular

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,820
frameworks in the intent to implement

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,920
process so the intent to implement

00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,030
process is like how chrome announces

00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,610
like we're gonna implement this feature

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,510
that is a standard and like people can

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,160
come in and be like oh that would be

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,510
really hard to implement or like that

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,180
would require a Ryoka texture of the

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,100
entire blah blah blah system so sorry

00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,990
they're basically now involving frame

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,030
authors like myself in the process of

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,860
like deciding what to do and I should be

00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:42,020
clear like chrome is not the web and

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,520
there already is a standard process that

00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,559
web developers are already involved in

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,010
like because of all the work that people

00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:50,630
have done so this is not like chrome

00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,640
doesn't get to involve web developers

00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,710
but there was a problem which is that at

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,210
the end of the day browser vendors have

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,470
a lot of control over what goes what

00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,150
happens in the process because they're

00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,830
the ones who get to ship so a big

00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,990
browser saying like we're involving

00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,210
regular web developers in the decisions

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,620
about shipping things really makes a big

00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,150
difference in terms of like where the

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,130
leverage comes from in this in the

00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:13,580
standards process so that's really

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:15,650
exciting and in general like that the

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,960
ballpoint 3 is like a very vague thrinng

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,669
thing but in general chrome has spent a

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,220
lot of effort in the past year more or

00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:26,659
less of really involving web developers

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:28,130
more in their own process so like I said

00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:29,330
I could I could give a whole talk on

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,970
like how to get involved but I'll give

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,070
you like my quick hits here so first of

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,840
all like if you're interested in doing

00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,090
technical work and you want to do

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,679
something with standards like go ask

00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,570
your favorite framework author like hey

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,250
you probably have standards goals like

00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,380
what could I help with and there's

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:49,510
actually a lot of stuff like as much as

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:51,830
I made fun of the testing thing before

00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:56,210
you could write tests you can do a whole

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:58,460
bunch of stuff so I'm just delegating to

00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:01,669
your yes I see I'm almost out of time I

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,990
have like three slides left this thing

00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:05,419
is the thing a lot of people don't know

00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,440
about so this is like a really

00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:07,940
well-organized

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,909
dashboard that tells you like where

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:15,230
every single tc39 proposal is by stage

00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:17,600
each one of them links to a tc39 links

00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:20,030
or repository which has regular issues

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,010
and regular pull requests and does

00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,440
things the usual github way and it tells

00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,370
you like what the progress is so

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,840
definitely check this out if you're like

00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,580
I wonder what the status of that feature

00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:34,909
is or how can I help move this feature

00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:36,530
over the finish line you can also try

00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:38,000
features out with Babel I put a star

00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,370
there because there are some like ornery

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,900
tc39 members who get angry when you say

00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,610
like oh people try it out with Babel and

00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,679
now we shouldn't do something different

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,510
because people liked it I think

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,230
increasingly those people are not

00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,840
winning but

00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,250
there is definitely a sense that like we

00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,660
shouldn't feel beholden to whatever

00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,669
happened to ship in Babel and I think

00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:59,690
like as a user trying to things out in

00:28:55,669 --> 00:29:00,770
Babel you should realize that like I

00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,600
said it's a big deal that things aren't

00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,309
get out like just go to like if you're

00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,419
wanting to talk about decorators or

00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,610
optional chaining or pipeline or

00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:08,960
whatever just go to the go to the repo

00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:11,600
look for an issue that you're interested

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,610
in open an issue help write explain or

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,679
as facts whatever people really love the

00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:20,390
help and I just want to close by with

00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:21,410
the part of the extensive web manifesto

00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,169
this is what the extensible web

00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:26,840
manifesto closed with and what I

00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:29,480
basically said was you know the open web

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,100
is seen as always being behind the

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,200
walled garden competitors like open web

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,320
is seen as being worse than iOS or worse

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,440
than Android and there's a real good

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,850
reason why that's not true which is that

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,470
Android and iOS comes down from a

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,880
mountain every year and they hand you

00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,710
the things that their developers came up

00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,870
with and so the feedback loop is really

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:51,380
slow and when things are working well on

00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,940
the web we have a path for good ideas

00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,070
from web developers to become a part of

00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,350
the infrastructure of the web and what I

00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,809
said in the extensive web manifesto that

00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,220
got so many so many signatures is we

00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:03,290
have to enable web developers to build

00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,570
the future of the web and I think more

00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:07,040
than ever now that's possible and I so I

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,809
would encourage everyone here to help

00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,990
build a future of the web thank you very

00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,990
