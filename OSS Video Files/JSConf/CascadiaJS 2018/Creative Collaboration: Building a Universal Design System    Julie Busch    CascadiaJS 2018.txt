Description: 
	CondÃ© Nast, the publisher of such titles as WIRED, The New Yorker, GQ, Vogue, and Vanity Fair, consolidated the codebases of their 20+ websites to improve development speed and product flexibility. Multiple engineering teams built various interconnected components of the new software from the ground up; concurrently, design teams created a system that allows the publications to share the same code and retain their unique look and feel. This presentation explores early challenges of this change and how the evolution of our workflow streamlined the design and development process.

all right hello everybody my name is

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:17,160
Julie Bush I work at Conde Nast in New

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:21,170
York there we go okay so I work at Conde

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,189
Nast in New York it's right there and

00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,810
we're going to put this on hold for just

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,750
a sec because before we get to business

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,490
I have been advised to be relatable and

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,880
so I'm going to tell you a little bit

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,880
about myself

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,250
so I actually don't come from a

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,090
traditional computer science background

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,920
I used to be a stage manager for theater

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,570
I'm pretty new to this game I've been

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,960
working for a little over a year and a

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,670
half in the industry to be very

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,260
reductive about what a stage manager is

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,199
just so that you understand the context

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,239
during the rehearsal process the actors

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,940
and the director are focusing on the

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,829
artistic development of a piece and the

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,629
stage manager is figuring out what needs

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,360
to be done to make all of those things

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,710
happen in real life and communicating

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,680
with the necessary departments and

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,600
people and so on so I was drawn to

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,299
coding because it has many parallels

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,400
with the organizational analytical and

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,830
problem-solving skills required in stage

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,549
management and also because both fields

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,619
are highly collaborative and I'm not a

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,960
loner so you know I enjoy working with

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:32,250
other people and coming together to make

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,409
cool stuff lastly I'm also a very long

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,390
game kind of person so I've always

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,630
enjoyed being in a position to watch the

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,189
evolution of a product over time it's

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,290
just as interesting to watch the process

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:48,869
for me as it is to have a final product

00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,360
and so now perhaps you'll have some

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,000
understanding behind what my talk is

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,700
focusing on today so now that you can

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,189
relate to me I am going to go ahead and

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:05,790
get started with creative collaboration

00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:10,020
building a unified design system so we

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:12,720
left off here conde nast new york as was

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,349
mentioned Conde Nast has a lot of

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:21,569
different brands many disparate types

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:24,989
and topics and the way that things used

00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:28,440
to be back in the days of yore was that

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:30,480
every different brand had its own team

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,700
of Engineers and its own code base for

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,950
its website and of course this seemed

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,170
sensible because this is a company that

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,090
started in print publishing over a

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,980
hundred years ago and so the way that

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,540
the magazine's work is that they each

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,400
have their own separate team so as

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,800
digital started to be integrated into

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,769
the company you just add people to each

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,760
of those teams and you know carry on

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:57,690
but consider that despite the very

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,879
distinct tones designs and topics of

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,720
each of the brand's their digital needs

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:06,840
are actually overwhelmingly similar for

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,019
example some shared site needs include

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,099
the ability to show aggregated content

00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:15,390
which is to say something like a home

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:21,269
page or a page showing content by author

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:24,209
by by subject you also need to be able

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,190
to show the actual content itself when

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,040
someone chooses an article to read or a

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,590
gallery to look at and that is pretty

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,900
much it that's what we do that's content

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,690
and you just need to be able to view it

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:42,290
that's a website for us for the most

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:45,269
part so with that being the case having

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,280
separate teams for all of the different

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,129
websites starting to make less and less

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,989
sense because with the sites being as

00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,330
similar as they are in terms of what

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:56,040
they need it would make sense that any

00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,689
feature that works well on one site

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,599
would work well on another and we would

00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,780
want to pass it along so I don't need to

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,989
go too much into explaining how that's

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,900
not really efficient in order to get one

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:11,370
feature onto every different brand by

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,090
having it passed from brand to brand

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,420
with dev time in between and so on so

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,480
we've said that was enough of that

00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,940
and we set forth a plan to create a

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,000
single application that would host all

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,730
of our sites we'd have a library of

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,100
shared components built in react and

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,970
these components would not just be the

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,890
visual aspects of the designs but they

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,980
would really be like truly plug-and-play

00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:42,770
pieces of a website like you put in a

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,960
newsletter signup form you pop it in

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,130
there and you have a newsletter signup

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,570
form it's connected to the API

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,230
everything works people can use

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:55,010
immediately as once as soon as it's live

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:56,930
and so that's that's our lofty goal to

00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,700
increase our efficiency to reduce or

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,770
done didn't see and it's really be able

00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,870
to move a lot more quickly in terms of

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,050
developing products that will help us

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:11,530
stay innovative and ahead in the media

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:15,830
industry so this application which we

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:20,510
lovingly dubbed diverso was what we set

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:22,090
out to do a little bit before the end of

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,290
last year we started making the server

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,040
we moved to working on front-end stuff

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:30,350
near the beginning of this year and so

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:34,160
just for clarity's sake in case you were

00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:36,650
wondering this is the deal if you want a

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,410
feature to be given to many different

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,570
brands all we want to be able to do is

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,630
develop it one time hence one clock

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:47,240
inverse oh and then it'll automatically

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:53,000
be available to any brand that is hosted

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:55,630
therein and we had a few requirements

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,980
around how we wanted to implement this

00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,790
because you know without some

00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,420
limitations

00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:04,940
it could very easily be messy

00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,940
so one thing was that we decided but we

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,740
would have no brand specific code

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:14,060
reusability was going to be the key in

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:17,480
terms of everything we did because if we

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,300
want to add features they need to be

00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,180
able to be popped into any given brand

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:29,270
site and working immediately

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:31,220
so no brands specific code another is

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,700
that we needed to make it scalable be

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,670
cuz Conde Nast has over 20 brands right

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,100
now we need to support all of those but

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,930
also we need to support any number of

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,510
brands that they may choose to add in

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,180
the future and it should be just as easy

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:50,500
for our application to support 40 brands

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,580
as it is for it to support two and

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,270
lastly we really needed to get it done

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:59,030
as fast as possible that is because I

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,240
think that the you know the business

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,590
advantage here is clear in terms of

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,960
restructuring the team and you know how

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,790
the websites work and also because we

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,030
don't want to have to support both

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,960
legacy websites and this new app

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,160
concurrently for too long at the time

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:18,710
and perhaps most importantly because you

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,210
can't go to a brand and say hey we

00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,520
figured out a way to make a really cool

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,100
application that's gonna be really great

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,630
for everyone in everything and we're

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,860
gonna stop working on what you've got

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,790
going on right now so we can work on

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,410
that and we'll be done in five years

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:40,419
okay bye so with that being the case

00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:45,919
time was of the essence so really how

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:49,940
how indeed mr. walberg JSON JSON is

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,700
perhaps not the not what you would

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,190
expect for an answer to this question

00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,630
and you probably also wouldn't expect it

00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,820
to have exclamation points like that

00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:04,520
because I feel like it's not typically

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:06,470
so exciting but here it is the the main

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:10,040
way that we were going to pull off this

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:13,040
system was by having every brand based

00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,590
in a configuration in that way we would

00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,910
be able to not have any unique logic

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:22,490
written within our components and still

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:26,020
have all of the brand's maintain their

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:28,130
you know unique visual appearance

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,979
because you know the differences need to

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,539
live somewhere otherwise you've made a

00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:35,900
lot of people really angry and you've

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:39,530
just made one website so how does that

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:43,610
work in terms of the like what does this

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,790
configuration file look like so this is

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,990
an example

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:51,630
of how we started going about with here

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,730
colors one of the many many things that

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:58,680
need to be uniquely adjusted for every

00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:00,540
brand so you'll see that we have these

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,380
different key value pairs and these are

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:08,190
referred to as design tokens the design

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:11,160
token just being the name of the unique

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,850
bit that is being used as the dynamic

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,000
element of a certain website that gets

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:21,360
changed on a brand by brand basis so

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,110
here our palette has different color

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:29,010
values and then we have different use

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:31,829
cases where we were creating tokens that

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,110
were semantically named but still

00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:35,880
decoupled from their usage again for

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,829
reusability we didn't want to name

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:43,380
something you know footer link because

00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:45,720
theoretically that everything should be

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,910
somewhat consistent and you might want

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,720
to use that link token again elsewhere

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:59,579
that's not a footer and you know you

00:09:51,720 --> 00:10:04,730
don't confuse people so so how does that

00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:08,610
actually become styles what we did was

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:11,279
set up our JSON to be loaded into our

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:15,300
Styles which we were writing in sass as

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,370
a map and then from there we can do

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,160
things like make this nifty function you

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:25,079
see at the bottom that just references

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:28,019
the map to get a color value and then

00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:31,440
you can use that function like so in the

00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:34,920
sass and without having written anything

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,709
brand specific within your Styles you're

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:43,860
getting brand specific values based on

00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:47,880
what your domain is also how is atomic

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:51,029
design you may have heard of atomic

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,220
design if not is essentially just a way

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:55,589
of sorting things from the smallest most

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,779
indivisible pieces and combining them

00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:59,759
into larger pieces

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:03,350
this was against a way that we chose to

00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:06,360
do things for the sake of reusability we

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,850
actually hired Brad Frost who wrote the

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,399
book atomic design and who is the source

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:16,290
of this image as a consultant on this

00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:18,629
project and he did say that while he has

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,879
a ton of experience making design

00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:23,309
systems for individual brands what we

00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,769
were really doing was making a design

00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:28,110
system of design systems and he didn't

00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:31,639
really know how it was gonna work so we

00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:37,980
were going into uncharted territory here

00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:38,730
and so without really a case study to go

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,449
off of

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:44,129
in terms of workflow and such we set out

00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:46,139
with our initial process and the way

00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:48,540
that we thought was best to get started

00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:50,420
which was to reverse engineer the design

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,449
system from the existing brand designs

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,689
because we did want to give the brand's

00:11:54,449 --> 00:12:00,509
some assurance that they would not be

00:11:56,689 --> 00:12:02,430
losing a lot of their uniqueness in this

00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:04,259
changeover that we wouldn't be just

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,699
producing cookie-cutter websites that

00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,319
just you know changed the logo at the

00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:09,180
top or something everyone was very

00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:13,350
concerned about maintaining their design

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:16,290
integrity and so it made sense for us to

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:20,699
start with the original designs in order

00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:24,209
to maintain that so we would get design

00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:26,910
specs as usual with just an image of a

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:31,110
page make this thing have it look like

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:33,629
this have it work there you go and it

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:38,040
would be up to the engineers to actually

00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:40,350
find and separate out the different

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,040
components that would be part of the

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:47,399
atomic model and also to decide how to

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,550
make those different dynamic elements

00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:54,769
between brands into tokens that would

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:57,629
then be part of this JSON configuration

00:12:54,769 --> 00:13:00,269
getting started we went with two of the

00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:03,179
more minimally designed brands and chose

00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:05,420
them for the pilot run of a templates in

00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:08,129
this case here was the contributor page

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,250
so you'll see we started with Golf

00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:13,950
Digest and self which are

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,070
somewhat similar few things differing

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,720
mainly the shape of the images that's

00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,300
you know the most distinct thing a

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:27,210
couple of quirky nav decorations at the

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:30,870
top there and in order to get this app

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:32,760
running we decided to go with two to

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,420
start with and then add the rest of the

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,640
brands in in stages so we were going for

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,070
a process that we intended to be very

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,130
iterative so we started with the first

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:47,340
two brands very similar here and here

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:50,120
built an app and then would loop in

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:54,120
another brand that's a little more

00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:57,720
complex and another brand and so on and

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,850
our theory was that eventually once we

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,220
had gotten all of the brands supported

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,220
in our application we would be able to

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,050
support any other design that came our

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,050
way we would have all of the knobs and

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,590
switches needed and everyone would live

00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,590
happily ever after

00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:20,520
that didn't happen right away so there

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,839
were some things that we found in this

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:27,150
approach that were not ideal first of

00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,760
all I did mention the speed thing where

00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:32,390
it was of the essence to get this

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,980
project done as quickly as possible and

00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,720
with the setup that we had multiple

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,510
engineering teams couldn't work

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,140
concurrently because merging without

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,680
conflicts was essentially impossible

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,940
that is because with the JSON

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,250
configuration with it being up to the

00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:53,040
developers to decide exactly how to

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:59,750
abstract different parts of a visual

00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:02,730
design into a purely data based form was

00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,950
well not not only difficult more

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,930
difficult than you might think in terms

00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:11,300
of making it make sense

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:13,680
and having it be semantic and reusable

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,800
but people would make different

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,839
decisions that would cover different

00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,610
things thinking that they were different

00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,870
things but they weren't for example

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,810
people would be working on the

00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:28,230
contributor page you might set up the

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:30,900
in a certain shape to cover a certain

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,400
piece of the design such as let's say

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,220
the difference between the image shapes

00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,430
and another team working on say an

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,250
article page would set up a shape of a

00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:44,460
JSON config and it would be made to

00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,680
adjust the image shapes and not only

00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,290
would those thing pieces of code

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,680
conflict but they're duplicates of each

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:55,770
other and so we can't just have 17 ways

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,080
of doing everything in this file and so

00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:01,890
then we would have to sync up on it and

00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:04,260
decide which approach to take that

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:07,350
brings us to another finding which was

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,150
that we were having constant meetings in

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:14,279
order to try to keep everybody on sync

00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:16,830
with this project it was there were

00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,500
almost more meetings in a day than there

00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:22,650
was time to code really because it's

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,170
just not really feasible to keep a

00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:26,790
multitude of teams or even just a few

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:31,800
teams it's very hard to keep people

00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:35,070
synced to the moment on a line-by-line

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,050
basis in a gigantic JSON configuration

00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,820
file and know that nobody is stepping on

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,730
anybody else's toes that nobody's

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,070
duplicating anybody else's work so the

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,250
constant meetings were a very valiant

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:50,870
effort I will say to end that but there

00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:54,150
just aren't enough hours in the day and

00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:57,540
lastly it was hard to create a system

00:16:54,150 --> 00:17:00,570
with these problems because with the

00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,030
ensuing chaos that that's just not a

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:07,610
system if you have all sorts of ways of

00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,610
doing things just looped in there ad hoc

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:14,280
so with this information we decided to

00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:15,449
completely turn around the approach we

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,079
were taking to building this application

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:21,750
and focus first and foremost on the

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,480
system itself not the end product that

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:30,390
we were trying to achieve but the pieces

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:33,210
that would become the end product so

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,250
in this case I think of it as making the

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,710
bricks before the house whereas before

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,190
the house was coming first and bricks

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,140
were being pulled from the house

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:46,230
magically except not because magic spot

00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:51,750
real and neither was the way that

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:53,429
working on that project was going so the

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,030
designers actually needed to get a lot

00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:58,770
more involved in the implementation

00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:01,980
usually as I mentioned they hand off a

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:04,620
design a nice you know flashy finished

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,010
product and it doesn't matter how you

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:10,350
make it happen as long as it happens and

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,940
in this case we found that design needed

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,070
to be the first people thinking about

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,919
how to make it happen so that rather

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:19,890
than having all of the engineers

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,260
deciding on a day by day basis just as

00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:25,140
they were going through tickets what to

00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:28,640
turn into a token what not to how to

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:31,500
structure that JSON naming and so forth

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,049
the tokens were determined by the

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,880
designers up front so we started getting

00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:39,720
specs like these that were much more

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:42,260
technical where this is also you'll

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:46,440
notice not a brand but just a general

00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:48,900
brand list template and the designer set

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,090
it up so that they could decide all of

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,039
the things that they felt they needed to

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,789
achieve the unique designs of all the

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,710
brands and labeled them upfront and

00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:00,299
decided how they wanted to structure it

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,159
in a way that made sense to them since

00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:05,190
they're the ones ultimately assigning

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:08,190
these tokens to their designs when they

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:11,090
create them and then handing it over to

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:13,590
us where we would just need to make this

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:17,460
completely brand agnostic entirely

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:19,530
reusable template and fill in the blanks

00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:25,590
when it came to what parts of the

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:28,159
template were dynamic this is a little

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:30,330
bit more of a detailed view of that spec

00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,000
just in case you wanted to take a look

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,250
you can see that each of the blue

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,750
circles on the top part our numbers

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,580
labeling the different things that a

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,880
designer wants to be able to control on

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,610
a brand basis

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,740
and then they've hopefully listed out

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,740
all of the things just like a blueprint

00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:57,300
so we also had to end the merge conflict

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,310
madness which wasn't going to stop just

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,640
because the tokens were handed over to

00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:05,160
designers for their ideation with the

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,770
JSON going directly into component

00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,230
Styles as people were working on those

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,470
new specs that I mentioned there was

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:17,310
still the high potential for chaos and

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:20,460
despair so in order to rectify that

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:22,980
situation we decided to actually put the

00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,410
JSON configurations in the hands of a

00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,410
single team who would be the gatekeepers

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:30,330
and set up a layer of abstraction

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:33,390
between the JSON and the component

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:37,230
styles that would allow developers to

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:41,340
make the component styles safely in

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:43,050
peace and so we called it our SAS API

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,150
because it was a layer that we created

00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:49,620
within the SAS itself in order to

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:54,510
isolate the JSON from just the everyday

00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:56,790
developer making patterns so the SAS API

00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:59,880
starts out with the same sort of JSON as

00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:02,850
we looked at before and rather than

00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:07,710
going directly into a function that gets

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:10,920
used to set a style as we saw we first

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:13,110
create a variable that's using that same

00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:17,160
function we were using before and it has

00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:21,540
the information needed for the token

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,910
that it represents so we made a one

00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,690
variable in this case per color token we

00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:29,580
made mix-ins for the typography and took

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:33,930
every token that design handed to us

00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:38,490
and made some sort of SAS mixin or

00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:40,860
variable to cover it and in this way any

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:43,290
developer working on one of the

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,170
components would just have to use the

00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:48,270
variable in order to style it and that

00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:50,670
was then safe because should the

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:55,500
structure of the JSON change which it

00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:58,560
was likely to do or if anything

00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,440
went wrong or broke anything behind the

00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:04,710
Sasse api could happen without us

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,430
needing to update every single instance

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:10,410
in which a token was used across

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,750
numerous components all we needed to do

00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,570
was update the definition of its

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:21,090
representation in the SAS API and then

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:24,120
everything would be good again further

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:27,720
we worked on automating the creation of

00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,310
these JSON files one of the JSON files I

00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,710
would say one of the smaller ones is

00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:35,100
about 1300 lines it just goes up from

00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:38,310
there and you probably just don't want

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,240
to hand copy that so this is an example

00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,370
of the way that the designers in this

00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,530
new way of doing things started creating

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:49,920
their sketch files for the brand's

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,690
themselves making tables of all of the

00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,370
different values that they wanted for

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,960
the different tokens that would end up

00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:59,280
creating unique results within our

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,890
application and as I said it's just not

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,730
practical in any way for us to be adding

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:09,330
brands by manually coding this into a

00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,620
configuration so the designers and an

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:13,890
engineer worked together to actually

00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:17,850
create a sketch plugin written in cocoa

00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:21,540
script that would scrape the files which

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:23,930
the designers normalized for us so that

00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:27,960
there would be a predictable output and

00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,320
this little button here produces a JSON

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,690
file

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:35,550
in a minute listen a minute I mean it's

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:38,820
a computer so this is a big game changer

00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:44,760
in terms of moving forward just setting

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:49,650
up brands adding to our application so

00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:51,540
the results as I said multiple

00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,210
engineering teams were able to work

00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,700
concurrently on components after these

00:23:54,210 --> 00:24:00,570
changes that's because with the SAS API

00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:03,510
and without tens of hands mucking around

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:06,300
in the JSON everyone was able to work on

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,850
separate templates an article a gallery

00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,240
whatever they needed without being

00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,770
without

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,450
having to interfere with anybody else's

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,520
work and that gave teams a lot more

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,950
autonomy as well because they didn't

00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,600
need to have several meetings with other

00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,130
teams in order to come to an agreement

00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,360
on how they were going to do things the

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:25,730
way that things were going to be done

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,730
was being determined higher up than that

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:32,960
further the design system actually

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:36,690
became a system so instead of it being

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,510
just drawn from visual designs by

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,830
engineers the designers creating it

00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,620
really took it and made it what they

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:47,310
needed it to be

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:49,890
and lastly which was the ultimate goal

00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:51,450
of verso pages are able to be created

00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,130
and used by all brands immediately

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,830
because before we were going to add

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,630
brands one at a time so that our app

00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:00,350
would only support what we had already

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:04,340
woven into that sort of diagram there

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:07,980
now with brand agnostic components

00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:10,710
anytime a brand is added via config to

00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,930
the app it automatically has access to

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,630
everything within the app any feature it

00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:18,000
wants or needs and that wouldn't be

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:21,750
possible if we hadn't switched the way

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:29,340
that we start working from design first

00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:31,290
to bricks and pieces first so that's

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,560
what we did and we continue to do that

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:36,870
we are actually in the process of

00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,210
cutting over brands from their legacy

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,130
applications to verso little by little

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,710
we have some brands at a hundred percent

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:48,060
of traffic going to verso depending on

00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:50,820
the content type and we just keep on

00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,610
adding and adding to them and someday

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,640
all of our pages will be coming from

00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:59,060
verso each and every one and the

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,880
prophecy will be fulfilled

00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:04,820
so thank you very much I'm Julie Bush

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,950
I'm a curmudgeon so I only participate

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,110
in LinkedIn you will not find me on

00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:11,120
Twitter or elsewhere if you want to

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:14,000
friend me or I guess in this case it

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,770
would be colleague in me leave a little

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,410
note because otherwise I'll think your

00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:24,130
spam so I appreciate your attention and

00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,130
excellent let's have a good afternoon

00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,920
