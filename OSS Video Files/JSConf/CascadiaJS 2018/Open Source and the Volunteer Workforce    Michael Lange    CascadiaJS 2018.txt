Thank You Alan he's been killing it all

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,180
day at the bad jokes it's actually a

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,680
really hard art form because these jokes

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,660
have to be good enough that we realize

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,700
our jokes but bad enough that they're

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,170
not better than mine and that's hard to

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,790
do

00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,500
alright so I'm super excited to be here

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,090
and to be speaking this time I've been

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,740
to one other Cascadia j/s and I wasn't

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,060
attendee and it was one of the best

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,279
conferences I've ever been to hands down

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,560
but first some housekeeping we're not in

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,519
Portland we're in Seattle there we go

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,500
all right fix that so hello I'm Michael

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,510
Ling I'm terrible at talking with myself

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,460
so I made this cheesy collage to do that

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,989
instead I try to get outdoors and stay

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,820
active when I'm not at a computer but

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,739
for the most part I fail at that and I'm

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,350
just at a computer so this stage here

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,090
isn't really my natural habitat

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,070
by day I work at this company called

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,410
hashey Corp I'm a UI engineer I build

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,539
the UI the Nomad UI we have all sorts of

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,750
open-source products there but I'm also

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,489
a volunteer so on white sand weekends I

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,910
volunteer for this organization called

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,379
civic and here we have this mission to

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,210
make public information public knowledge

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,159
basically we think that there's this gap

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,049
between information being public and

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,260
that information synthesizing has

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,570
knowledge available to the people what I

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,549
registered 503 C we have two people on

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,030
payroll and our process goes something

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,009
like this

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,560
for six to nine months out of the year

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,500
we take about a hundred more volunteers

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,700
we work on five different projects

00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,799
ultimately creating an open API and a

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,770
web experience for each one of these so

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,430
for this 2018 project season we created

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,070
a housing affordability project a

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,619
neighborhood development project a

00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:40,170
transportation systems project a

00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:42,479
disaster resilience project and a local

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,890
elections project showing them as an

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,420
ordered list like this is kind of

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,399
misrepresenting it isn't some sort of

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,590
priority queue so really an unordered

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,299
list is better but even this kind of

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,380
gives this serial idea and we didn't

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,540
work on a one after another they were

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,939
all done at the same time so this is the

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,829
best way to represent this information

00:01:55,939 --> 00:02:00,299
okay you may be wondering like how in

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,979
the world did we manage to do this and

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,369
I'm so glad you asked that

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,930
welcome to my talk so I have about seven

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,640
lessons that I want to talk about both

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,250
successful ones and failures and the

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,420
first one is to have an org chart you

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,740
have to stay organized to your

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,140
contributors need to be organized

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,820
at a bargain we have over 100

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,770
repositories and over 200 people in our

00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,770
github board working on over 30

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,480
different teams and it gets kind of

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,890
chaotic I don't think we do a very good

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,750
job but there are lots of examples of

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,820
people who have done this honestly

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,860
better than we have one example is amber

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,300
Jas I think that they've been very

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,860
thoughtful in their open governance and

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,570
their organization so they have a core

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,040
team steering committee and then

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,110
additional core teams for these sort of

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,750
satellite projects such as ember CLI and

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,000
amber data but the key insight here is

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,790
that your organization is in network and

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,860
networks are graphs and when you're

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,870
looking at graphs graph complexity is

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,950
measured by the number of edges this is

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,060
the part where even though it's a soft

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,340
steel stock I have to talk about

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,590
computer science so once you get to 50

00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,970
nodes you actually have a thousand 225

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,830
edges if everyone's talking to each

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,900
other so instead you reduce that

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,520
complexity by eliminating edges by

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,070
creating an org chart you do exactly

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,960
that but when you're doing this work you

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,170
really need to be cognizant of Conway's

00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,870
law the gist of Conway's law is that

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,180
anything you make will show signs of how

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,890
that you're organized here's the whole

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,420
boy if you want to read it but I like

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,700
looking at code instead skip the

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,020
documentation and it kind of reads out

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,730
something like this first thing you want

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,840
to do is create an organization the

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,880
system is going to be something that

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,310
organization produces and then when that

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,780
system has issues you you try to change

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,300
things with it but that system still has

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,860
issues because the organization is what

00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,230
you got to change you can also think of

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,880
it as this the system is a function of

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,770
your organization so to change the

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,200
system you need to change the input the

00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,490
organization being really heavy-handed

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,050
here but this is like the

00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,330
bidirectionality here is a key insight

00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,520
so in 2016 or we're gonna work chart

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,350
looks up like this we had a founder and

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,840
we had five projects all reporting to

00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,000
the founder I had great results

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,830
everybody loved what we built teams

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,750
worked really efficiently but each

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,610
project looked entirely different like

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,960
you could you wouldn't realize that it

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,450
was the same organization behind every

00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,680
single one and I put an extremely heavy

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,110
burden on this person in charge

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,330
so when 2017 would change things look

00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,950
like this again a founder again five

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,140
project teams but now an additional

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,910
platform team in an Operations

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,500
Coordinator who facilitated

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,000
conversations between the platform team

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,020
and those product teams that ops

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,759
coordinator is actually the room right

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,430
now hi Megan

00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,689
and in 2017 we have more uniform results

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,610
which is exactly why we made the org

00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:34,129
chart change so that was good we had a

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,629
good distribution of responsibilities

00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:38,099
but it was inefficient we had the

00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:39,560
blocking request going through the

00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:41,849
founder and through the ops coordinator

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,409
and it sort of incentivized heroes on

00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,749
the platform team and they became single

00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:47,310
points of failure so again in 2018 we

00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:49,770
looked at it again and we ended up with

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,060
this so now there's the founder side of

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,710
the house working with the project teams

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,389
and each of these five product teams

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,830
also have the mini org chart within it

00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:57,900
it's some sort of leadership structure

00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,699
and the technical platform side of the

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,560
house you have the CTO yours truly and

00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,279
three other three teams underneath me

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,379
for DevOps for front-end and for design

00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,849
again each with their own team lead we

00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:10,889
had uniform results which is good we

00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:12,990
didn't backslide we still had a good

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,550
distribution of responsibilities and it

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,870
was more efficient because blocking

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,550
requests were now being load-balanced

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,379
with these team leads but there was a

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,300
lot of management overhead and it

00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,520
repeated work being done on project

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,710
teams so I'm sure again in 2019 we're

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,749
gonna change some stuff but you may be

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,759
wondering how in the world didn't even

00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:31,319
get that many volunteers I mean like

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,169
it's really easy for my product make an

00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,029
org chart it's just me like that's it so

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:39,750
that leads us right into lesson two if

00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:41,460
you build it they won't come so we're

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,139
surrounded by popular products like this

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,120
that have over a hundred thousand stars

00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,919
and a trillion billion people liking it

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,629
and like we call like these engineers

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,669
and rockstars and like Kent Dodds has

00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:51,990
been on 17 slides today I didn't

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,599
actually count but that might actually

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,159
be an underestimate so products don't

00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:58,289
start out like this they just don't I

00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:59,909
had to dig this old react web page out

00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:00,810
of the wayback machine because this is

00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:03,419
what it looked like when I was first

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,250
looking into react it first off the idea

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,349
that the react site even needs a page

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,270
called why react anymore it's kind of

00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:11,819
amusing but this give it five minutes

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,199
section is even better just reads react

00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:14,550
challenges a lot of conventional wisdom

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,710
and at first glance

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,050
some of the ideas may seem crazy and

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,399
it's just hilarious like not too long

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,319
ago they thought their ideas were crazy

00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,120
and now it seems more crazy to not use

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,330
reacts ideas so things can change pretty

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:33,030
quickly just look at this guy

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:34,349
so even the richest man in the world

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,330
first had to prove that he could sell

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:38,520
books before he could prove that he

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,690
could sell the promise of jobs to the

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:47,699
New York government for billions of

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:48,930
dollars so we all get caught up in

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,220
what's called this high insight bias

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,930
where we see success and we assume

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,819
that's just how it was ever going to be

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,470
it's inevitable success happens because

00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,120
that's a good project and was always

00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,740
gonna be we forget to see all the hard

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,629
work that went in the beginning and that

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,849
the risk you take on and the potential

00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,099
for failure we also get caught up and

00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:06,509
this sort of stars phenomenon it's

00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:08,159
important to note that that doesn't mean

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,389
success our front end probably gets

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:11,490
Civic we have more contributors and

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,479
stars which is kind of crazy but it

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,690
turns out you can get people interested

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,500
in your project without it going viral I

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,229
used to think something like this

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,789
regrettably the products inevitably

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:23,460
became successful but it's just not true

00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,319
I mean a bad product is likely not going

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,699
to be saved by good marketing but you

00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,590
just can't rely on word-of-mouth to get

00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,180
your product out and when it comes to

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,830
getting volunteers it takes a special

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,960
form of marketing that forum marketing

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,699
actually has its own name it's called

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,710
recruiting so I want to talk briefly

00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:40,080
about some of the tactics sivak does or

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,729
has for getting volunteers first we

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,190
build a network we have an email signup

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:46,340
pretty bread-and-butter typical

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,029
marketing technique to get sort of leads

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,460
we also want to leverage existing

00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:51,419
networks just by being on Meetup means

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,919
that our meetup is going to be

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,090
recommended to people in similar ways

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,310
and this is a great way to expand a

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,440
network we have a lead gen form for

00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,610
gauging interest in skill levels and

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,529
then finally we interview and pitch

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,629
these people to get them on teams and I

00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:05,009
want to put emphasis on pitching because

00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:06,479
often we think of recruiting or

00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,190
interviewing as a way to challenge a

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,569
candidate but when we're challenging

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,370
candidates candidates are also

00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:14,009
challenging us we want to work places

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,750
that are good so we're also judging the

00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,490
people interviewing us and if you can't

00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,770
get people behind your mission I'm not

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,479
going to join me please fast lesson

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,719
three here you need to ask what your

00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,849
community offers members Dan pink has

00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,949
this book called Drive where he really

00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:30,840
dug into what is motivation and he came

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:32,640
up with these three pillars autonomy

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,550
mastery and purpose

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,709
I suspect that Dan paint must be pretty

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,779
well off because uh money's nowhere on

00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:40,860
this slide and it's been my personal

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,969
experience at least

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,190
that people will put up with a lot

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,329
they're being compensated well or even

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,010
if they're not being compensated well

00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:48,620
but the alternative is no money at all

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,550
and the problems that come with that

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,680
so vault earrings in this fascinating

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,240
place where there's no money component

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,620
and we're a company gets some sort of

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,899
degree of forgiveness when it comes to

00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,860
autonomy mastery and purpose

00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:01,769
volunteering doesn't people will just

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,110
leave let's look at the 2018 org chart

00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:06,120
one more time and let's drill into the

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,980
front end team we made a dedicated

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,300
funding team for the first time in 2018

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,100
and as mentioned this is because we

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,570
wanted a unified web experience for all

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,310
the projects and it makes perfect sense

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,620
for the organization and it honestly

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,440
came out great but it suffers when it

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,510
comes to ball to your motivation do

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,950
these people get mastery if you're an

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,600
apprentice engineer sure you're writing

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,459
code for the first time in a safe

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,820
environment with no real consequences

00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:30,390
because yeah gonna be fired right for

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,740
autonomy

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,910
I bet this sort of depends on how well

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,800
we were at the tickets but I like to

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,300
think that our our individual or our

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,399
volunteers can surprise us and kind of

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,250
go off the beaten path and for purpose

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,870
only indirectly you're working on react

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,399
components which are far removed from

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,140
fixing Portland Civic problems which is

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,449
probably what God she went to Civic in

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,029
the first place so things start kind of

00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:52,320
looking like work and once you realize

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:54,510
that it looks like work but you're not

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,399
getting paid makes a lot harder to go

00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,769
every night at 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. to

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,510
volunteer for this thing um I don't

00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,910
really have an answer for this one it's

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,500
just sort of something we ran into so a

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,240
lot of iteration underfunded team and

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,949
other platform teams also as it turns

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,480
out so this is just something I have to

00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:13,589
think about maybe something you want to

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:17,250
keep in mind super sad but uh here's my

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:20,100
cat's well Hudson five product

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,510
management is for everyone much like

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,529
marketing early in my career I kind of

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,329
thought that product management was

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,680
unnecessary that engineering was really

00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:28,740
work and product management was just

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,790
pretending to be an engineer so when you

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,610
think like that you kind of think

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,500
product management must be optional very

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,720
very wrong by the way product management

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,570
itself is an expansive and difficult and

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,949
complex complex career path and when you

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,470
ignore it you're gonna run into one of

00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:44,670
two walls but first wall is that things

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,250
are being added to your project sort of

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,690
haphazardly and this may be great for a

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,310
sense of involvement in the community

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,199
everyone's crushing it getting their PRS

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,520
merged but your personal vision kind of

00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:54,270
gets lost and you start to feel like

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,640
you're losing control

00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,950
was once your baby while number two's

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,290
the opposite you never let go of control

00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,000
your voice is final your rationale

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,580
devolves into things like well it just

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,170
feels right to do this or what you're

00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,740
suggesting is just not good for this

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,750
project

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,700
he's Kanaly any contributors just

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,080
remember that even a benevolent dictator

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,020
is still a dictator

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,350
I went crashing right into wall number

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,730
two this year just head-on I went in a

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,020
room factored our entire funder in

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,820
architecture it's work that needed to be

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,470
done and there was a plan in my head and

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,730
I just sort of acted on it I didn't do a

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,530
good job sharing this plan with others

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,930
though so some people offered to help

00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,880
but I rejected them I was just saying

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,320
like you can help but you'll need to let

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,270
me finish this initial refactor first

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,680
and ultimately the refactor was

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,600
well-received and we were able to

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,220
collaborate after the fact but it would

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,100
be wrong to call that a flat a success I

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,720
happened at 20,000 line PR with ninety

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,950
commits and there was no documented

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,830
issue with the problem beforehand like

00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:52,200
that's red flag City and I had a lot to

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,240
say in the pr2 about my choices and

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,430
ultimately I think that people were

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,050
happy with the changes but while I was

00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,430
working on this I just left contributors

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,230
in the dark and I just covered it away

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,630
in a dark corner and that's no good for

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,040
those contributors so when discussing

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,170
product management we talked about

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,820
things like road maps or things like

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,980
North Stars there's lots of wayfinding

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,550
metaphors pretty much all of them I

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,780
prefer the metaphor of a vanishing point

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:18,750
so objects that are closed should be

00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,130
very clear detailed and understood and

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,650
this is what requires a media attention

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,240
as focus and focus but there's obviously

00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,070
a farther away they kind of become

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,960
blurry ER there's a rough idea of what's

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,820
ahead and that idea is shared amongst

00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,530
teams for release it needs to be but

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,090
it's also understood that a lot can

00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,670
happen between here and there and what

00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,680
you see may actually be a mirage so to

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,760
embrace product management he needed

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,050
spend time thinking about what you're

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,250
building and ask yourself these kinds of

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,260
questions what's right for your project

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,660
what's wrong for your project where your

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,770
priorities the timing right and how do

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,840
you even know if any of these things are

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,210
true why do you feel the way you do if

00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,980
you do this work you'll tear down wall

00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,380
number one because now you have a plan

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,000
you'll tear down number two well number

00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,670
two because you're able to articulate

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,380
the reasons you're rejecting work

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,330
communication makes all the difference

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,360
here being able to articulate your

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,040
thoughts and motivations is key no talk

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,889
simply without a pop culture reference

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,759
so here's a scene from Bojack horseman

00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,990
if you aren't familiar with the show

00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,480
first you should become familiar with

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,870
the show and second Bojack is a horse

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,759
man naturally he's also a depressing

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,040
alcoholic / washed-up TV star the show

00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,810
focuses on and Todd here in red is the

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,790
unlikely friend who is here finally

00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,380
venting his frustrations and it's a

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,579
super intense scene and if you've seen

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,949
the show I'm sure you remember this

00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:34,079
scene I'm particularly drawn to this

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:35,790
line you need to be better struck a

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,069
chord with him mostly because it came

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,230
from a friend like Todd could walk out

00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:42,750
but instead he's confronting Bojack and

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,970
saying look man you need to be better

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,139
and that's enough I can't say it's okay

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,839
you're gonna do better next time

00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,940
flat out you need to be better and our

00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,980
friends are our fans they want us to be

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,560
better and our contributors are too they

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,060
want you and your project succeed so

00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,910
saying no isn't automatically a letdown

00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,670
but letting a project spiral or fizzle

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,050
out absolutely is

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,980
so on that low note in Lesson number 5

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:11,339
lower your expectations this sounds

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,010
awful but I assure you it's not here's a

00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:16,529
ridiculous graph ideas come faster than

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:18,389
implementations and you're never gonna

00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:20,490
be able to get to all of your ideas the

00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:21,360
optimist will say yes do all of thanks

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,800
we can do this

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,149
meanwhile the past mints will say

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,670
something like doesn't ever be able to

00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:27,839
do any of this I don't like either these

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,329
outlooks I think they're both pretty

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,920
unproductive the optimist is ultimately

00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,120
going to be disappointed and the past

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,069
mess will achieve less than they could

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,449
have if they believe in themselves and

00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:39,269
meanwhile they're going to bring down

00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:40,649
everyone around them instead I like to

00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:43,170
sort of exist between these two spaces

00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:44,579
or the realist may say something like we

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,440
have a longer backlog thing we can work

00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,120
through or the idealist may say

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,889
something like let's track all of our

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,990
ideas I bet we can surprise ourselves

00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,300
with our output here's an unscientific

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,889
chart that basically just says I'm right

00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,829
and realizing my idealism is a little

00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:01,160
more effective it's great go ahead and

00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:01,160
take pictures

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,920
but we need to stay tethered to the

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,540
reality of volunteering so I personally

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,520
want to be 100 at volunteering I want to

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,870
be the best that ever was like no one

00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,590
ever was there we go detective Pikachu

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,990
coming in May so I also want to be 100

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,360
at my day job and I want to be 100 at my

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:22,300
friendships and my family in my

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,760
relationship and life upkeep but I can't

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,140
I like everyone else is bound by a 24

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,880
hour day and this is just simply too

00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,400
much stuff what if I lower my

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:34,150
expectations I can fit everything in and

00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,250
it's also when I'm kind of bored or like

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,590
I'm upset with myself I need to remember

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,450
that when I over book myself it impacts

00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,010
the lives of people around me there's a

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,390
blast radius to everything that you do

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,790
and it's going to impact the people you

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,800
love so even though I've lowered my

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,570
expectations and I encourage all our

00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,730
volunteers to sort of do the same and

00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,820
take days off over 20 18 we were still

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,230
able to ship this customized exploratory

00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,180
map where we correlated poverty rates

00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,800
with access to food we were able to

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,170
share insights from public attract

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,300
campaign financing and we were able to

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,550
open up and visualize Harvard's state of

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,320
the nation's housing report and we

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,820
analyzed TriMet ridership data year over

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,470
year to tell them these ridership

00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,630
changing how our neighborhoods looked

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,940
these years and we created personalized

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,380
Maps using the Department of geology and

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,270
mineral industries Cascadia subduction

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,950
zone research to see how different

00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,830
neighborhoods would fare once the big

00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:26,590
9.0 earthquake hits so Captain Obvious

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:29,040
reporting in here slow and steady is so

00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:32,590
much faster than not moving at all

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,080
alright there are ways to work smarter

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,850
and not harder though so even if you're

00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,290
doing less work you can sort of create

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,620
an acceleration effect by doing things

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,420
like lesson six writing the docs so we

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,740
build on top of open source and one of

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,750
the great features of that as we get a

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,150
head start because our projects like

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,370
react and redux already have awesome

00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:54,790
documentation and shout out to ducks

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:57,220
learn did a great job reacting Redux

00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,210
both have amazing documentation but

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,370
you're never going to get something like

00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:03,010
this civic questions are never going to

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:06,430
be answered in redux Docs so there are

00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:08,050
benefits to writing your own one is that

00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:10,630
you don't have to repeat your

00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,250
explanations and now volunteers don't

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,450
have to rely on you to answer all their

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,460
questions

00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,260
in person explanations end up being

00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,270
blocking requests well doctor

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,550
asynchronous and as much as I'd love to

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,890
scale myself out horizontally that's

00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,450
called getting fat but when it's a web

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,940
server it means you now have more uptime

00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:30,430
so what does this kind of product

00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,960
specific documentation look like for us

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,540
it was as simple as committing markdown

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,550
files to our repos I think as engineers

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,740
we're really easily distracted by the

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,790
machinery of Docs and we quickly end up

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,650
in rabbit holes where we start talking

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,500
about different static site generators

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,970
and templating options and how my static

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,520
dad can beat up your static dad and

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,870
different deployment pipelines and we we

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,300
sort of forget that the most important

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,010
part of the docs are the words and that

00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,780
writing good Docs is already a hard task

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:59,500
and it doesn't really need further

00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:01,120
complication on day one but keep in mind

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,890
our writing Docs doesn't have to solve

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,050
you of all of your responsibilities as a

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,000
mentor maybe your Doc's aren't reading

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,010
well or maybe they assume more expertise

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,570
than a volunteer has I mean after all if

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,760
books were all that was needed to teach

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,020
stuff I mean wouldn't need teachers and

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,870
hopefully I don't need to explain to

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:19,630
anyone that we need teachers all right

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,820
final lesson here this one isn't really

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:24,130
my area of expertise smarter people have

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,720
said much more on this topic and they're

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,760
way more qualified than I am but I

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,560
really do believe that the times up for

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,710
white guys who assume this is someone

00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,300
else's problem so I'm gonna try to go

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,580
through some of my thinking on this the

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,460
very first question is why why should we

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,780
even care about diversity inclusion I

00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,820
hear a couple common excuses over and

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,710
over the first one is sort of the

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,360
meritocracy fall people are truly

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,340
created equal then every individual

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,760
individual must be hot-swappable

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,200
or I might be a white sis hat man but I

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,640
read about these issues and I can be an

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,040
ally for people with different

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,990
backgrounds so first to clear the air

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,640
here people aren't identical no one's

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,980
saying that we're all individuals with

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,030
unique experiences and perspectives

00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,190
equal here means equal treatment in

00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:11,680
equal opportunities as for that second

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:13,870
Hajin of the problem you may be a

00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,220
fantastic ally it's absolutely possible

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,770
but everyone suffers from unknown

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,750
unknowns and we're always learning and

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,860
even though we try our hardest stand up

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,450
for people from different backgrounds

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,670
it's just not the same as representation

00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,410
and it's never going to be this chart

00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,570
here is completely unscientific there's

00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,740
no

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,419
way to quantify the things that you

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,750
don't know you don't know but there's

00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:34,220
plenty of evidence of this problem so

00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,220
let's go back in time here and look at

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:39,049
how a photo labs were calibrated and

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,029
they just didn't have dark skin tone as

00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,740
a mind they use this picture of a white

00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:45,440
woman with black gloves and it meant

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,880
that even to this day people with darker

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,309
complexion have a harder time showing up

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,210
on cameras in this kind of problem it

00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,440
just keeps happening

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,330
here's another problem with dark skin

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,029
tone calibration where soap dispensers

00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,230
don't work and it happens again heart

00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:00,169
rate sensors have a problem with dark

00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,450
skin like at this point how in the world

00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:04,460
right this is not an acceptable problem

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,159
to have and maybe your startup product

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,200
isn't like hand dryers you're probably

00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,320
not working on that although I bet

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,090
there's some disruption there so you're

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,740
thinking this isn't my problem because

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,049
this is the niche target audience that I

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,610
can actually represent maybe I

00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:21,139
personally work with civic tech and

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,379
civic tech needs to work for everyone so

00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:26,330
I can't avoid this but keep in mind that

00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:28,549
this isn't only an issue for whites this

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,440
hetman we happen to be the dominant

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:31,870
demographic which means that we carry

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,009
the most power and therefore

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,480
responsibility for driving social change

00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:37,429
so even movements like me too doesn't

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,019
keep Kavanagh out of the Supreme Court

00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:42,110
and that's because of white guys just

00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:44,960
own that but individually no one is

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,279
diverse a group of white woman is going

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,629
to be biased towards woman needs in a

00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,629
woman at wedding excuse me in white

00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:52,490
history likewise a group of black men is

00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:55,750
going to have similar problems this is

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:58,309
because diversity is a group phenomenon

00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,470
only groups can be diverse this is going

00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:02,470
to change over time as your group grows

00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:06,470
or the composition of your group changes

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:08,450
it also means that rejection on the

00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:11,750
grounds of diversity shouldn't be taken

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,980
personally it just means the problem

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,139
lies with what you either do or don't

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,149
add to a community but on the flip side

00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:20,419
if you're the person who's choosing a

00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:23,419
candidate or a volunteer to be to join

00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:25,399
your team keep in mind that diversity

00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:27,049
isn't always visible there are lots of

00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:29,899
things that make us diverse that we

00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:31,669
can't actually see with our eyes with

00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:32,570
all this in mind how can we expect DNI

00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:34,370
to solve itself

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,649
someone needs be paying attention to the

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,330
composition of your community and it's

00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:40,250
not enough to react once a community

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,230
gets a modulus is the issue

00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,540
to compound consider shellings

00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,370
segregation model it's very simple model

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,990
meant to see if segregation in the u.s.

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,790
is potentially the result of just a

00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,460
slight preference rather than an intense

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,230
deep-seated racism I mean it ignores

00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,120
mounds of historical evidence in caveats

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,530
so it's not like the most accurate

00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,090
explanation of American neighborhoods

00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:01,130
but the emergent behavior is still

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,350
interesting because it turns out over

00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:05,450
time agents do segregate based on just

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,920
this slight preference what's most

00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,480
fascinating to me is that there's

00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,850
nothing in this model that is explicitly

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,980
about race and sometimes people have

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,480
reasons for their preferences I've

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,680
worked with plenty of women in tech who

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,360
look for companies that already have a

00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,710
good number of women there that's

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,060
because they're sick of being the token

00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,220
woman who suffers from token woman

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,930
problems like these are big things like

00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,880
stunted career growth or an increased

00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,590
risk of sexual assault but also small

00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,450
things like just being cold all the time

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,310
or expecting to conform to the one of

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,740
the guys attitudes or just being the

00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:35,810
de-facto dishwasher I think this is a

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,760
valid preference and there are many like

00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,500
it but the grand effect is that if you

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,030
already have a decently sized son

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,670
Lajeunesse culture you have an uphill

00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,170
battle to fight for diversity and this

00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,600
is why it's so important to take DNI

00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,940
seriously on day one you need to be

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,860
proactive in recruiting individuals and

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,140
to do this well you need to have

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,620
internalized the real reason why we even

00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,780
bother

00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,670
it's not about hiring women so we have

00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,790
women it's about eliminating blind spots

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,680
by having more representation and if you

00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,750
can do this if you can nail recruiting

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,860
and that fixes half the pipeline problem

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:12,350
but pipes have two ends we also have a

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,970
DNI retention issue in tech so employee

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,230
attrition is normal there's nothing

00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,750
inherently wrong with that people leave

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,510
jobs but in tech retention rates are

00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,340
lower among underrepresented groups this

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,930
means that even if you do an outstanding

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,730
job recruiting a diverse group of

00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,890
volunteers you may end up with the

00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,680
mosely homogenous group over time by way

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,440
of attrition but you can be proactive

00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,550
about ski boot engine rates as well

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,040
whole talks can be given on this subject

00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,960
we here's a starter kit first be open

00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,820
about your values culture ad will

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,170
usually mean something at a company but

00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,510
if you can't articulate what that means

00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:47,210
then you're creating a space for bias to

00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:48,830
creep in likewise you should write

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,600
rubrics for all of your assessments

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,800
beforehand this can be candid assessment

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,630
it could be code review it could be

00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,290
promotion assessments but if we don't

00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,060
have a framework for

00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:58,850
your judgments then once again bias is

00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,870
going to creep in third you should have

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,390
these one-on-one meetings with people

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,500
and really listen the easiest way to get

00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,530
caught off guard is by not paying

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,120
attention and I personally like I said

00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,040
like to sit in front of a computer away

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,360
from humans so I like to avoid

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,720
uncomfortable situations like everyone

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,100
else

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,300
so it's really easy to not have these

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,760
meetings because that's the path of

00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,890
least resistance it's a bad thing to do

00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,140
I assure you the fourth is that this is

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,180
ongoing work taking an unconscious bias

00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,830
training is great but it doesn't mean

00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,020
you're now impervious to any potential

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,640
misstep it's about putting in place

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:32,930
processes and best practices to reduce

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,160
as much risk of missteps as possible so

00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,350
the last point I want to make about this

00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,720
though is mostly for my fellow white

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,550
guys in the room I've talked to many

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,500
white guys who feel like they're now

00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,390
walking on eggshells kind of consoling

00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,310
on the edge and fearful of ladies social

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,950
justice coming down and just smiting

00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,720
them into oblivion and like I'm gonna

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:53,210
get that there's a lot to be mindful of

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,910
these days or really always but suddenly

00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,500
we're not aware of it so there's so many

00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,180
ways to screw up but I personally find

00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,460
solace in knowing that no one is asking

00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,570
you to be perfect a microaggression here

00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,490
and there isn't going to melt your

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:07,010
coworker turns out under represented

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,530
people in tech like seriously tough and

00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,760
they deal with this crap every day and

00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,100
it's really easy to tell the difference

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,410
between an honest mistake and

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,120
disinterest or adversarial protest now

00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,670
this isn't to say that you should do

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,300
whatever you want without thinking first

00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,310
because there's so much you can learn

00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,150
about others by just spinning a few

00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,470
hours on the Internet

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,360
like it's senseless to expect

00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,380
underrepresented people to correct you

00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,190
on things that you could have just

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:33,860
looked up on your own but when you mess

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,110
up and you're going to mess up here's my

00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,540
three step guide to recovery first

00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,980
apologize for your mistakes second

00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,050
reflect on why your mistakes were taken

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,880
the way they were and third use this new

00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:46,370
knowledge to be better in the future

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,470
and although like calling out white guys

00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,760
here this is good advice for everyone we

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,470
all have baggage and it's often

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,820
invisible and we'd all benefit from

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:58,220
taking the time to understand each other

00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:59,750
so to wrap things up here growing and

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,730
managing a community is just incredibly

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,770
hard work it really is and it's so easy

00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,600
to be blindsided by the responsibilities

00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,110
required when you started out as an

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,110
engineer and gives kind of wanted to

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:11,520
code and be helpful but I assure you if

00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,770
you can commit to these responsibilities

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,570
you will ultimately build something that

00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:19,610
is much more helpful than it ever would

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,610
