oh right well hello everybody thank you

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,020
guys for coming out for Cascadia hope

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,330
lunch was good and it was settled in for

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,759
this talk he said my name is tre AMA

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,530
tuna and through my journey of growth of

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,599
my life I've been everything from a

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,600
waiter to a restaurant manager a

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,400
breakdancer DJ audio engineer and for

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,109
the last two and a half years I've made

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,900
this wonderful transition into software

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,390
engineering thankful from my hack

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,990
reactor crowd to really bring me into

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,059
this I'm also a partner to an amazing

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,910
woman and three boys at my house with a

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,770
little girl in the way finally and I

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,110
have this mindset that I constantly

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,860
strive to be technically creative in a

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,309
creatively technical way so I'm here to

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,140
talk to you as was said about something

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,390
that I really believe in and something

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,879
that we really do a lot of where I work

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,489
which is although right here in downtown

00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,660
Seattle we are an online marketplace for

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:03,989
legal services and advice and through

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,689
this and my entire journey of life I've

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,909
really gotten into this factor of to

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,640
build a culture of growth is to build a

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,250
culture of engagement and truly when you

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,670
have that it's key to individual and

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,680
company success so from the moment we're

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,280
born our minds and our bodies really

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,590
strive for one thing it's to grow now

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,740
we're gonna go through why this is

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,540
important and also go into some things

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,600
that you can start at your own company

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,299
to really foster this culture of growth

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,970
and engagement but at first I want you

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,950
to remember when you were young and you

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,409
really couldn't wait to grow up right

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,430
but when we're getting a little bit

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,899
older we're like wait wait wait what the

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,869
hell were we really thinking about this

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,790
like it's fun to be a kid I look at my

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,960
three boys and I really want to look at

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,799
him it's like well it's really fun up

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,820
here

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,860
really it's a trap hold on but when

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,909
we're young we have those that we admire

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,700
and what we really want to do is we want

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,560
to grow up to be like those people I

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,789
really want to shout out real quick on

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,349
all the firefighters that are down in

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,870
California right now taking care of

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,260
those fires and hopefully a lot more

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,970
young

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:20,159
grow up to be like them but throughout

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,440
this entire journey we take bits and

00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,690
pieces of everything that we learn and

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,379
we try to put them together in this

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,810
puzzle of who we are throughout every

00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:32,819
single interaction that we have we take

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,000
that and blend it in with our innate

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:39,150
personality and they essentially become

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,470
part of our puzzle of life and it comes

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,709
to this concept of growth is an

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,410
iterative process we're always growing

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,299
and we never really stop through all of

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,310
this there's one thing that influences

00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,470
us more than anything else in our lives

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,410
and it's the relationships we have with

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,260
those around us our families our friends

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,129
our teachers professors and the people

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,200
that we work with and we learned so much

00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:06,060
from all of these interactions that we

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,230
really would never be able to learn if

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,030
we're on our own

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,879
and this is the essence of a concept

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,280
called cultural learning what cultural

00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:18,060
learning is it describes a way that a

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,040
group of people within a culture can

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,950
pass on information and skills

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,680
much faster than one would be able to do

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,859
individually with this though it begs

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,900
the question kind of what is a culture

00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:33,150
my personal favorite description or

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,980
definition of culture comes from the

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,989
cambers dictionary where they say

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,389
culture is the way of life especially

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,430
the general customs and beliefs of a

00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:44,069
particular group of people at a

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,049
particular time I really love this one

00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:48,569
because it also puts in that factor of a

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,709
particular time it kind of describes the

00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,930
fact that not only are we growing

00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:54,269
ourselves but the cultures that we are

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,340
part of are growing the entire time as

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,400
well

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,900
so what culture is really formed

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,730
whenever any group of people get

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,280
together so we're part of many cultures

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,019
at any time in our life we have family

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,109
cultures business cultures cultures

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:13,440
around art hobbies sports and

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:15,120
entertainment facilities right in fact

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,340
every single person here in this

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,699
audience right now is part of a culture

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,200
of Cascadia j/s and I want to thank you

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,510
right now for being a part of this

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,600
culture together with myself and so we

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,190
can learn and grow to get

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,840
last year indeed released their best

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,450
places to work list they do every year

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,060
and the number three company on that

00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:38,820
list last year was JetBlue when

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,740
interviewed Rachel McCarthy's SVP of

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,200
talent described their culture as the

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,300
DNA of the company and this is really

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,460
true because in today's business

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,800
cultures it's more than ever important

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,950
to cultivate these concepts of culture

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,500
of growth and engagement because by

00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:59,490
doing this you can pull in that factor

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,630
of engagement and of course when I'm

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,710
talking about engagement I don't mean

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,229
this kind of engagement

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,750
I mean employee engagement with their

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,190
work right well last year a Gallup

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,870
released their state of American

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,479
workplace report where they released

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,060
that 31 percent of American employees

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,520
are actually engaged in their work 52

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,180
percent are not engaged and 17 are

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,010
literally disengaged from their work

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,710
this can be really alarming in some ways

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,360
and they also talked in here about this

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,370
is costing American businesses five

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,340
hundred and fifty thousand are a billion

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,620
dollars a year now let's see what

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,870
happens in this same report when an

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,550
employee reports that they actually

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,490
actively learned something the previous

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,520
day they engaged and not engaged

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:49,080
categories nearly flip where you have

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:52,140
65% now engaged and only 30% not engaged

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,020
and even that actively disengaged comes

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,419
down a little bit of a step so maybe you

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,550
can look at this factor of constantly

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,900
learning as maybe putting a ring on

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,690
those employees because of the factor

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,250
that now they're less likely to leave in

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,770
fact they might be running around saying

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,080
I am engaged and I'm happy with where I

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,510
am and ultimately this leads to one of

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,520
my favorite quotes which is when you do

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,860
what you love you'll never work a day in

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,410
your life but how do we build this

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,750
culture around engagement and what is it

00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,150
that developers really want when they're

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,850
looking for a job well there's plenty of

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,169
surveys out there for this by show how

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,680
many people have actually filled out one

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:34,169
of these seeing excellent thank you all

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,970
all of you because hopefully you're

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,070
gonna help me in this next few things

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,040
right here the first one we're gonna

00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,800
look at is -

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,230
eighteens stackoverflow were a hundred

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,840
thousand developers reported on this and

00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,150
if you look at this we have compensation

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,630
and benefits coming up as a very top and

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:55,570
then number three is opportunities for

00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:59,200
professional development number six is

00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,250
the culture but really when you think

00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,020
about this and what we're talking about

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,300
and building a culture around learning

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,830
and development this is going to

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,660
skyrocket to the top and be the number

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,870
one thing that developers are really

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,770
looking for so let's continue looking at

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:16,630
this we have hacker ranks 2018 report

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:20,140
here professional growth in learning

00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,820
took number two and then once again

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,400
company culture is down here at number

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,440
six but then when we build this this one

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,300
really probably skyrockets to the top

00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,540
and I want to look at number four and

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,430
five here - that's smart people to learn

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,870
from and interesting problems to solve

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,960
we'll kind of revisit that again in a

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,910
minute but when you ask people that are

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,430
coming fresh into our industry that our

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,590
students it actually flips over and now

00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:49,450
we have growth and learning here at the

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:50,920
top and all of these kind of come up so

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,380
now interesting problems comes up to

00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,970
three smart problem company and

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,950
teammates comes up before and company

00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,200
culture comes up to five so once again

00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,630
this is very important to the people

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,980
they're looking for jobs same thing

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,900
happens with coding game learning new

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,930
things now new things now comes up to

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,730
the top by a larger margin smart

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,860
colleagues complex problem solving and

00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,500
flex and then culture comes down in here

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,160
as well so people really want to learn

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:21,070
things to keep them engaged in this and

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,930
so the final step of this is something

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,540
that I said on the smart people team and

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,650
colleagues so the old saying and

00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,810
surround people yourself with people who

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,760
are smarter than you it's one of the

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,750
classic sayings right and it makes sense

00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,000
by everything that we said from the

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,560
beginning the biggest influences in our

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,900
life are the relationships with the

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,060
people around us so of course we'd want

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,140
the have the smartest people around this

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,390
in our team because then we can

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,970
hopefully become smart by proxy there

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,830
and every organization once they're the

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,020
best people on their team but which

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,250
states have the best developers they

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,209
actually did a survey on this as well

00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,769
and I have to

00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:57,100
that here in Washington we're number one

00:08:53,769 --> 00:09:00,129
so yeah we've got the best developers in

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,720
the nation but of course every company

00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:05,499
can't specifically have the best

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,329
developers on each team and their comes

00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:09,999
in this thing that companies kind of are

00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:12,220
a little bit scared of investing in

00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:14,110
junior developers and trying to really

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,459
bring them up and they want senior

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,170
developers they want the best people on

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:19,899
there but I think this is one of the

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,360
craziest reasons not to in hire junior

00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:24,220
developers and help invest in them every

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,889
developer has heard the words leave the

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,360
code better than when you found it well

00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:31,300
what about leaving the developers better

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,490
than when you hired them right

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,029
another thing happens whenever you build

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,230
this culture of learning in engagement

00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:39,819
that you have these systems in place so

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,009
if somebody does leave and you have to

00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:44,259
hire somebody on you now have a system

00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:45,879
in place to teach them and to bring them

00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:47,439
up to speed to where you need to where

00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:50,920
they can really contribute to your

00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:53,230
company as one of the only little things

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,600
that you that comes out you see the talk

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:58,480
of a CFO saying what happens if we train

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,579
them and they leave us and the smart CEO

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:06,850
really comes back and says what happens

00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:08,860
if we don't and they stay so there was

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,670
another report by a company old great

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,949
place to work

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,499
they did a generations report where they

00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:18,100
assessed the benefits of a great

00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:19,449
workplace across generations where they

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,490
found the employees who experienced a

00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:23,199
great workplace are far more likely to

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,299
want to remain at the organization a

00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:27,699
long time this of course saves companies

00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:29,379
on recruiting and training and really

00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:31,869
Foster's the performance of stable teams

00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:35,619
an interesting thing that they found is

00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:37,199
that throughout the generations really

00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:39,429
it's really similar

00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:41,079
Millennials Generation X and baby

00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:42,819
boomers are in the 90 percentile when

00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,189
they're happy that's when the in the red

00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:47,110
is a happy person versus the gray is

00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:49,929
kind of somebody's not happy in their in

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,970
their job when we really look at this

00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:54,699
we're like okay wait a second also

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,860
Millennials are now twenty five times as

00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:59,829
likely to stay at their job when they're

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,600
happy versus when they're not when baby

00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:02,980
boomers really will stay whether even

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,079
they're not happy and only seven times

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,920
more likely I mean who says Millennials

00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,260
are really flaky

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,029
flighty right this really proves that

00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,399
that's not it's quite the case we just

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:16,389
need to keep these people happy and they

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,920
want to stay the next one we can see how

00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:19,510
proud they are to tell others about

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,980
their job so that's another thing it

00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,209
comes up when somebody is happy and

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,649
engaged with their workplace they want

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:26,110
to talk to other people about that

00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,180
workplace they want to kind of display

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,620
to the world that I work in an amazing

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,170
place look at the wonderful things that

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,490
they allow me to do and learn and so

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,560
what happens with that for the company

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,209
when you are hiring somebody else now

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,889
you have a plethora of people that are

00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:40,570
already kind of know about your culture

00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:43,570
and they want to be there and they're

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,579
one that come work for you finally what

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,310
this will talk about productivity there

00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,810
one last thing on here which is the fact

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,860
that when you have happy people they're

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:55,959
much more productive on the job so three

00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,579
to four times as productive on the job

00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,850
when they are happy versus when they are

00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:03,190
unhappy that's money right there for any

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,779
business that has these people that

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,790
means that literally you could pretty

00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:09,730
much take a day off of work every single

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:12,010
week and be just as productive by the

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,070
four-day workweek than a five day just

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,740
by having happy people so what can we do

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,089
to build this culture of growth at all

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,370
though we have a lot of wonderful things

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,680
that we do and I'm going to go through

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,600
these and give a little description and

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,000
maybe a little few tips that I have one

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,890
of these as well the first off is kind

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,829
of the easiest to do lunch and learns or

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:35,170
brown bag sessions so this is a simple

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:37,269
factor of getting together with a group

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,370
of people over lunch people bring their

00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:41,470
lunch into a meeting room and one or

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,990
multiple people can talk about something

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,360
that they know and then it's really just

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,980
there to help disperse information or

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,199
teach something or get people kind of

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,660
enticed on on something kind of like

00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,970
these talks here the next is lightning

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,670
talks once again we see this a lot in

00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,040
conferences 5 to 15 minute long talks

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,899
and the really nice thing here is they

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,339
can be done really in succession so

00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:05,260
maybe during a lunch and learn you can

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:08,920
have four or five different people do

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:11,470
smaller talks there another one that I

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,860
really enjoy working with is third-party

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,569
workshops so how many people actually

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,100
heard about the graph QL workshops or

00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:19,180
ones are the react workshop or any other

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,210
workshops that we have

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,830
here excellent I know I saw a lot of

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,540
people at the graph QL workshop they're

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,030
here tonight as well and I thank you

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,920
guys for coming out here because that

00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:35,410
was actually a product of my own work

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,570
using these techniques a third-party

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,520
workshop can be done in a couple ways

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,140
they can be done privately for companies

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,090
which can be quite expensive for the

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,430
companies or they can be done in a more

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,900
open way and that's how I really

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,570
presented these with it like what the

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:53,110
ones were like the graph QL workshop so

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:55,570
I contacted even Alex who put that

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,400
workshop on and said hey my company is

00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,680
working with graph QL I would love for

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,070
you guys to come out and help train my

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,650
devs on this I have a room I'll pay for

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,390
lunch all I and allow you to sell

00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,430
tickets outside the company as well and

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,200
bring the public into this all we ask is

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,150
for some tickets for our own devs to the

00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,310
workshop and as compensation for that

00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,560
and of course since they're actually

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,800
from Tahoe or Lake Tahoe in California

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,900
and not from this area I put out my own

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,140
network to get them connected with

00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,610
places like Cascadia J s so that they

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,640
could sell more tickets and they could

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,110
make money for themselves so I'm really

00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,880
passionate about these ones and it's a

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,560
very nice thing you can do and bring it

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,840
in and also be become part of the

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,790
community as well

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,380
another thing is learning stiffens so

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,890
every manager really should have a

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:47,110
learning budget for their developers and

00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,880
we're not talking about really just like

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,200
tossing money at developers so it's like

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,400
hey hey hey I want to learn this I want

00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,010
to learn that but they can really spend

00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,560
these types of things on such like

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,760
online tutorials for you my favorite

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,720
ones being things like front-end masters

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,030
or egghead IO Kent Dodds new testing

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,180
course or the wonderful West boss

00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:09,310
courses that are out there but this is

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,470
just a way that we can help people grow

00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:14,230
in their own time as well now another

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,510
one is reference libraries so books I

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,330
don't know about you but I love books

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:22,450
I love reading them I love going the

00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:24,040
library picking out new books and having

00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,300
a nice reference library at work is

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,140
great because you can have all the

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:31,060
online resources possible but really it

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,320
that's physical nature of the book and

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,510
allowing you to really look

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,830
it's a different experience and you can

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,810
really find some things in there that

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,660
you won't be able to find as quickly

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,820
online another big one is mentorship

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,500
programs so this is something that

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,900
really is kind of free but it really

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,910
just takes a lot of work you have to of

00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,620
course find people that want to be

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,300
mentors find people that want to be

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,610
mentees figure out how to mesh these

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,880
people together but really this is a

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,620
program that can touch people's lives

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,040
almost in a way that none of these other

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:06,040
types can mentor mentee relationships

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,080
can be lifelong relationships and by

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,080
working on a program like this at your

00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,970
organization you can truly be touching

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,090
people's lives for the rest of their

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,770
life by this one moment and it really

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:21,330
also has that same impact on not just

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,890
the mentee but the mentors as well

00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:27,580
another great one that we're all a part

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:29,200
of right now conferences right there a

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,900
great thing we can get together we can

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,840
learn so I mean how many people got

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,610
their conference tickets from their jobs

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,030
having a yes that's nearly half the

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:42,040
audience here it's a great thing in a

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:45,190
phenomenal way for us to keep up with

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,070
our industry network and really see

00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,780
what's going on protip on this one try

00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:53,110
to get a group of people together to go

00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:55,120
on to conferences I mean when you have a

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,250
group of your own organization going you

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,600
can really gather yourself together you

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,430
can learn from each other it becomes not

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,089
only an experience of the conference

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:06,850
itself but also a team-building event

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,990
the next one is a really big one and can

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,480
kind of be a little bit harder for a

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,360
cell for a lot of companies it's called

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:17,290
20 percent time we have this a Tavo it

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:20,790
started off at Google and this is really

00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:23,530
the concept of one day a week an

00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,990
individual contributor can basically

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:28,570
work on whatever they want to they can

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,890
learn something new they can build a

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,840
little project that they've been

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,360
thinking about as long as it kind of

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,300
relates to the work that they do and

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,100
their job in fact when Google started

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,180
enacting this they had a few things come

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,740
out of here and you may have heard of

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:46,090
them adsense Google Maps and the real

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,150
big elephant in the room that was the

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:52,090
start of all this Gmail some of the

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:56,110
biggest apps in the entire world came

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:59,320
out of this thought of 20% time and

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:01,809
although we have a really sleek shipping

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,080
method and a way of getting testing

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:06,610
environments ec2 testing environments we

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,340
have a we go to an app that we have

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,750
simply called ship it and we make a few

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,320
clicks to the button and we have an

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:16,210
entire ec2 instance provisioned

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:20,020
terraformed and ready to go with our our

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:21,190
company's entire app stack on it I hit

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,020
what branches I want there's

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,539
automatically deploy and now I have my

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,890
testing environment and then if I want

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,450
to ship to production a couple more

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,270
buttons my branch is shipped to

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,620
production and it's all done as you can

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,320
guess that this came out of a 20% time

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:38,440
project and it saves countless hours of

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:41,140
our developer time on shipping so these

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,940
are really a way that companies may not

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,520
look at that factor of like what are we

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,870
really getting back to this but you can

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,120
come up some really cool things when you

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,950
just let your developers flourish have

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,830
fun and work on things that they want to

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,380
the last one I'll talk about is deep

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,950
dive days so this is a fun one that I'm

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,960
working on right now and essentially

00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:05,260
these are full days that a group of

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,539
people will take their 20% time go into

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,059
a room together and learn something and

00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:12,370
dig into it a lot more than they really

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:14,140
could on say a Lunch and Learn or a

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,970
little bit individually and as I said

00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,890
this is kind of a group thing which also

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,799
allows you to interact with each other

00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,919
work together ask questions and they can

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,299
be led by a person on the team or you

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,210
can do things like go through online

00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:30,190
courses things like egghead or front-end

00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,980
masters which really have these longer

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,390
courses that individuals can go through

00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,450
but when you go through them as a group

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:42,159
you get that multiplying effect of that

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:44,380
cultural learning once again and so I

00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:45,820
really also want to stress on the factor

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,279
that remember you're not just a consumer

00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,990
of the information whenever you're doing

00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,860
these things it's really also in your

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,690
best interest to be an instructor as

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,040
Aristotle told the world teaching is the

00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:02,360
highest form of understanding

00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,680
and it really is it helps you cement the

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,220
thoughts and the learnings that you've

00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,260
had

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,240
I don't know how many people recognize

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:12,470
this guy kind of big in our environment

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,120
here Kent C Dodds very big in our

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:18,560
wonderful world of JavaScript and he has

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:21,710
a concept he talks to that is consumed

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:26,150
build teach this is the way that he

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:28,280
personally uses or learns new concepts

00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:31,070
and news technology he goes out he

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,530
learns them he consumes information he

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:37,070
builds products with those and then he

00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:39,530
teaches them to the world in his talk

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,960
zero the 60 in software development how

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,090
to jumpstart your career he brings in

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,000
the quote from Ashley Williams the

00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,800
absolutely love teacher is nature's way

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,130
of letting you know how sloppy your

00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,080
understanding is when you teach concepts

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,270
to people you're gonna get those

00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,620
questions and truly you're gonna go wait

00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:02,930
wait I'm not sure and that's something

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:06,080
that is that concept of a you don't know

00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:08,000
what you don't know in many ways so when

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,210
you teach other people and you take that

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,670
time to help instruct others then you're

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:16,130
really also finding the holes in your

00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:20,030
own understanding and can go afterwards

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:23,000
and start filling those holes in so

00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,620
remember through this that the key to

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,860
success is to build a culture of growth

00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:31,250
which in extension builds a culture of

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,840
engagement so invest in yourself and

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,600
your colleagues and leave everyone

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:39,950
around you better than when you found

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:42,950
them I want to leave you with a final

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:46,520
quote from actually the former CTO of

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:48,650
Otto kevin goldsmith where he says the

00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,450
culture of the place that you work will

00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,130
be much more important to your success

00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,350
and Happiness than the specific

00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,660
technologies you work with or the

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,600
products that you work on so find the

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:02,810
place that helps you grow and thrive

00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,350
first and foremost thank you very much
