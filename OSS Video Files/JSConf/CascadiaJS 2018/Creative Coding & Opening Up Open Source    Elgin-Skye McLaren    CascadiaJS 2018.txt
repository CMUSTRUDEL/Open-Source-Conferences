hi everyone um just before I get started

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,420
um has anyone ever used processing

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,710
before like show of hands okay close

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,730
some people have that's awesome so I'm

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,370
not talking to people who are like

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,280
totally strangers to it so I'm so

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,650
excited to be here honestly like I have

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,439
literally been hearing about Cascadia

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,300
j/s for years so it's really cool to be

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,029
here and actually be presenting for you

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,619
guys on a topic but I really like uh and

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,420
I wanted to just take a moment to

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,429
acknowledge all of the organizers who've

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,800
put in so much work to organize this

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,239
like it's really not easy so if we could

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,430
just give a little round of applause for

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,230
them thank you so much so um my name is

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,260
elgu sky and apparently I have one

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,789
jacket and I included a photo of me so

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,920
that you would know that in fact I am

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,600
NOT an imposter how do I look relatively

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,030
similar I think I do

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,010
um and today I'm so excited to be

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,320
talking to you guys about creative code

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,670
in the browser but before I get started

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,039
I just want to give you a little bit of

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,039
a roadmap of what you can expect over

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,199
the next 20 or so minutes so first of

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,090
all hello I'm gonna tell you a little

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,040
bit more about me and some of the work

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,760
that I do and how I use creative coding

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,729
in my process next I'm going to try my

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,070
very best to explain creative coding to

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,530
you or define it rather and I'm gonna

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,450
try to get you guys excited about

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,869
potentially using creative coding in

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,060
your own projects in the future next I'm

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,040
gonna talk to you guys about p5.js which

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,320
is a JavaScript library that makes it

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,360
really easy to do creative coding in the

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,150
browser and I'm gonna tell you a little

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,250
bit more about why I like it and finally

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,689
I'm gonna try to do a live demo of some

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,840
coding to see like actually the

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,850
nitty-gritty of how you get started you

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,299
will be impressed by how easy it is to

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,420
make cool stuff so who remembers this

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,960
this little guy not the pineapple but

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,899
rather mspaint I'm not sure about you

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,549
guys but I spent a lot of time with this

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,280
program when I was a kid probably

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:06,030
because the internet wasn't like

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,409
actually available at my house so even

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,259
though I knew that wasn't gonna be the

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,330
world's first millionaire from selling

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,290
my bitmap images I think it was like BMP

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,050
it's

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,000
um I still spend a lot of time working

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,010
on it and as I was doing that I was

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,380
learning new skills so I was learning

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,750
how to do things because kids and adults

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,170
we learned through exploration and play

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,430
and so while I was making these creative

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,810
things I was also learning how to use a

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,780
mouse I was learning how to work with

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,060
color etc etc and I can't help but think

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,160
that maybe I'm here today in part at

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,950
least and maybe for you guys too because

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,920
I had access to creative tech tools when

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,610
I was a kid but let me just improve my

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,400
skills so um

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,950
flash board a couple years actually many

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,980
years I grew up and I started working in

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,720
the arts and I actually came to coding

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,360
because when I was working in the arts I

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,800
wanted to develop media arts projects so

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,870
I started doing a little bit of stuff

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,060
with like max/msp and I was hooked I

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,760
really liked it and so I decided to take

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,350
a web development bootcamp I worked in

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,910
industry for a little while and then

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,280
decided that I was not done with school

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,959
yet so when I got an opportunity to go

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,549
back to school to do my masters of

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,560
Science and interactive arts and

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:21,810
technology at Simon Fraser University I

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,860
jumped at the chance because it meant

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,620
that I was going to be able to bring

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,450
together sort of my to like main things

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,579
that get me excited in life art and

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,209
technology and sort of combine them into

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,920
one so my main research area is actually

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,600
on child computer interaction so that's

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,299
one of the reasons I mentioned mspaint

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,430
earlier but I also research tangible

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,500
computing and so what tangible computing

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,070
means is manipulating digital

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,660
information with physical objects but

00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,340
one thing I'm really fortunate about are

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,380
really thankful is that I actually get a

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,120
lot of time to be doing creative

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,570
projects when I'm at school so in my off

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,730
time I do a lot of like sort of like

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,549
self-improvement projects by just like

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,959
building weird things and I also get an

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,609
opportunity to work with a lot of

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,890
undergraduates and graduate students

00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:10,769
who've never ever coded before and I get

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,660
to introduce them to it so before I

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,680
tried to define creative coding for you

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,590
I want to show you some of these

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,120
projects that I've worked on recently

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:21,180
but I think I would define as being

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,190
creative code so this is plant agachi it

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,510
is a smart planter I guess is what you'd

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,550
call it and it's like a

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,810
between at a Medina planter and so

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,160
basically when you're about to kill your

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,880
plant because you haven't watered him in

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,220
a couple weeks

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,800
he preemptively turns his eyes to exes

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,870
and then you're like oh I should take

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,390
care of that this is a brain computer

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,220
interface series of lights because you

00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,170
know everyone sort of always wanted to

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,270
power a computer like a light with their

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,220
brain so it uses EEG sensors on the

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,930
forehead and then it changes the the

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,760
color and the intensity of the lights

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,250
and the one that looks like a brain is

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,990
actually one that it's like a miniature

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,990
model of a large-scale project that

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,060
we're doing with some other students and

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,920
this final example that I'm going to

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,860
show you it was inspired by my work with

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,260
the Vancouver laptop ensemble and what

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,700
it is is it's a laser heart so basically

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,200
it's a series of lasers and if you put

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,720
your hand in between one of the lasers

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,970
they'd ideally be further away I don't

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,440
have a good photo of it but you put your

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,290
hand in there and then it triggers some

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:27,990
code that's gonna be making music or

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:29,940
maybe not music but noise so I'll get to

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,010
the honest truth is that I kind of hate

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,530
the term creative coding because all

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,850
coding is creative like even if you're

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,460
not working on these kind of weird

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,350
projects every time you're faced with a

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,820
coding challenge you have to maybe think

00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,940
of some sort of creative way to solve it

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,040
so for the purposes of this presentation

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:50,550
however I'd like to sort of define it by

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,380
two specific things one is its art space

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,420
and don't let that scare you there's

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,650
like an academic where you could look at

00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,120
it and say it's about making something

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,210
that's expressive rather than a

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,690
functional product not that my laser

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,840
harp was not functional it just it was a

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,330
bit more on the expressive side so it's

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,640
art based but I prefer to think of it

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,410
more as being tech that's fun something

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,550
that's exploring a new space

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,950
something's maybe a little bit

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,410
surprising or unexpected or something

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,120
that encourages exploration and the

00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,100
other way I define creative coding is

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,030
it's inclusive it's community oriented

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:30,260
and frankly it's how would I put this I

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:33,810
I had a great way of putting it but

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:36,520
basically because it's so built around

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,379
being doing explorations and stuff

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,000
everyone is welcome to take part in it

00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:41,319
whether you're a professional developer

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,490
like many of you or whether you're

00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,889
someone who's just getting started in

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,340
code it's more about the process than

00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,720
the final product and it's more about

00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,360
just having fun doing it rather than

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,190
having like the perfect code and for

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,840
that reason it's a really great activity

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,030
for people who are either brand new to

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,819
coding coming to coding from a different

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:04,479
field or someone who just wants to have

00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:05,710
some fun and I would like you guys in

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,610
your mind you don't have to do this out

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,190
loud because I don't want to embarrass

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,240
you but you do not need to be an artist

00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,280
to be an artist

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,900
so repeat that in your brain after me

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,409
you don't need to be an artist to be an

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,240
artist when you're making art with code

00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:21,400
what's really awesome is that

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,870
you actually just need to tinker and

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,340
that's all you need to do to be able to

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,620
create some really fun and surprising

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,240
things a for loop in your JavaScript

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,099
program doing something else might just

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,659
iterate through some numbers but in

00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:35,590
creative coding it could actually make a

00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:37,389
pretty picture know the examples that I

00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,460
showed you earlier we're mostly hardware

00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,900
based and I did that for a reason I

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,039
showed you hardware based things because

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,080
I thought it would be really easy to

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:47,650
comprehend how they were kind of weird

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,940
like kind of to be honest useless sort

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,440
of examples they're cool but like

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:55,029
they're not they're not saving anyone's

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:58,539
life but you can do it with anything you

00:07:55,029 --> 00:08:00,669
don't need to have hardware you can you

00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:02,680
are all already JavaScript developers so

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,469
you can make interactive art in the

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:11,289
browser yourself you don't need to use

00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:15,060
mspaint you can make ms paint and the

00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:17,620
other thing that I really wanted to I

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,599
had another point on this slide but

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,229
clearly it wasn't that important so I'm

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,150
just gonna skip over I was like don't

00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:27,909
forget that one thing and now it's the

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:32,380
one thing that I forgotten no it really

00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:34,000
it wasn't that important but before you

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,459
guys go bursting out the door and

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,289
starting to work with the SVG and the

00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:41,680
canvas elements which are really core to

00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:44,200
doing creative interactive art in the

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,180
browser I just like to point out that

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,910
they're not always the most intuitive to

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,690
use um so I think it was actually just

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,610
pointed out in the

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,080
presentation by Shannon that if you want

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,380
to do what's up with WebGL which is

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,780
based in the html5 canvas you know it's

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,160
a lot of kind of crazy code that you've

00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,080
got to go through and it's not always

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,180
super easy particularly if you're

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,410
someone who's brand new to coding or if

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,000
you're someone who's just doing it for

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,410
fun like no one wants to spend their

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,500
weekend working on a project and like

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:14,880
having to figure out all this like kind

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,960
of code that's really convoluted

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,720
especially since other people have

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,460
already made libraries and api's and

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,170
extensions and such that it's gonna make

00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,320
it a lot easier to do this sort of stuff

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,940
in the browser so some of the libraries

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,020
that you might be familiar with are

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:34,480
d3.js which is a really awesome package

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,480
for working to do data visualizations

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,040
using SVG s another one that got

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,350
mentioned in the last presentation is

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,750
3GS which is great for doing like 3d

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,570
rendering in the browser but for me

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:50,680
personally I really love p5.js

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:52,300
and so you might ask why I love p5.js

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,510
because it was specifically made to

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,920
create art in the browser and so the way

00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,660
it works is it makes it easy to work

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,330
with the canvas element it provides

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,420
shortcuts etc that make it really fast

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:07,060
and quick to create interactive data

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,700
visualizations games etc so these are

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,340
some still some screenshots from a

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,500
project that I did over the summer

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,730
they're all animated and interactive but

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,820
I didn't have time to turn them all into

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,050
gifts for you so my apologies but you

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,520
can see kind of like some of the pretty

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,730
things that you can make in the browser

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,590
and so some of you have already like I

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,920
had you guys raise your hand and see who

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:33,130
had already who DS processing so p5 is

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,710
actually based on processing so

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,780
processing is an IDE it's based in Java

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,370
and it's been around for almost two

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,770
decades now so it's been around for a

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,390
while and it is sort of like the go-to

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,980
standard when it comes to creative

00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,089
coding if you do a google search of

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,010
creative coding you'll come up with

00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:51,160
processing and it was really designed

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,290
for artists and non coders to be able to

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,750
create visualizations super fast and

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,390
easy without having to learn a lot of

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,580
like code that wouldn't be helpful

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,570
within that project and the neat thing

00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,750
about processing is that not

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:08,390
only is it easy for beginners to learn

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,280
it also it's robust enough for

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,720
professional media artists for

00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,960
professional developers and for

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,640
professional inventors so I just grabbed

00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,300
a few stills off of their website if

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,040
some of like Processing's like gallery

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,740
in terms of like what you can do with

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,020
that so this is a data visualization

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:30,020
this is some really cool generated

00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:34,850
scenes that have been printed out using

00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:36,380
ballpoint pens with CNC machines and p5

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,500
brings this technology and the core

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,270
ideas of processing to the web so a few

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,460
years ago Lauren McCarthy worked with

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,700
the processing foundation to not only

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:49,220
bring over the syntax of processing but

00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:54,340
also to bring over sort of the ethos and

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:58,280
by that I mean the it's a very inclusive

00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,490
organization and so p5 aims to replicate

00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,040
that

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,780
so processing talks about how their game

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,880
aim is to promote software literacy

00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,970
visual literacy and make these fields

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,010
accessible and they do a really great

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,130
job through excellent documentation and

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,050
a fabulous YouTube channel called the

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,360
coding train with Daniel Shipman which

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,100
has like the funniest videos I think on

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,630
how to do computer science contest

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,790
concepts from beginning to much more

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,730
advanced in a really fun and accessible

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,770
way but for me what's really meaningful

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,990
and one thing that I hope that you guys

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:32,960
will take away from this talk if nothing

00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:37,100
else is that if you are involved with an

00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,530
open-source organization p5 has a really

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,060
obvious welcome welcoming statement a

00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,360
community statement on their main page

00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:47,090
and in that it basically says everyone

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,070
is welcome here and this might seem like

00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,600
just a little bit of text on a website

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,590
that no one's ever gonna pay attention

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,790
to you but it's something that you

00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,220
actually see referred to in the

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,870
community quite often so for example

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,970
we've got some screenshots here of

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,520
people who are standing in front of

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:04,730
presentations that have it up and also

00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:08,270
it's reflected in the discourse forums

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,100
as well as the github pages and for me

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,170
this is really personal because I saw

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,250
that statement like I'm not necessarily

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,710
I'm not from a computer science

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,060
background I saw

00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,010
statement and two days later I made my

00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,990
first open-source pull request never

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,370
done it never considered it but I saw

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,860
that and I was like oh this can be my

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,720
community as a result of that I actually

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,240
applied for and successfully got a

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,250
google Summer of Code position working

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,830
with the processing foundation so these

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:35,200
words have meaning anyways you're gonna

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:38,290
race ahead do some demos show you how it

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,400
works so the way that I'm gonna go

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,190
through this is first I'm going to show

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,080
you some just how to work with the raw

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,390
canvas element without having p5 just

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,010
for comparison's sake next I'm gonna

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,220
show you how to make a p5 sketch that's

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,390
a they're word for a p5 program I'm

00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,250
gonna show you a little bit about

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,290
working with externals and interactivity

00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,450
and then I'm gonna show you a little bit

00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,750
about plugging in like extra JavaScript

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:07,120
libraries oh wow you don't need to know

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:08,830
that yet okay so just for the interest

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,010
of time I've already like I'm not gonna

00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,660
code this part live for you but when you

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,280
work with the canvas element has have

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,190
people here worked with the canvas a lot

00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,630
show of hands so a lot of you have but

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,830
for those of you who haven't the way

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,170
that it works is when you create a

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,910
canvas element on the page you've got

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,320
basically just this like blank space and

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,180
anything that goes inside of the canvas

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,790
is actually invisible to the Dom so you

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,320
can't style it with CSS or anything you

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,950
have to do all of the styling through

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,370
JavaScript so I've got sort of a very

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:41,890
simple example here so first of all I

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,080
have to find my canvas element using

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,730
javascript next I've got to tell it that

00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,900
I'm gonna be working in two dimensions

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,890
I'm not gonna be trying to do any sort

00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,780
of WebGL or 3d stuff and then if I want

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,480
to make it turn to a different

00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,910
background color then I've got to

00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,310
actually create a new rectangle that's

00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,330
the same size and shape as the existing

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:07,690
canvas and before hand I've also got to

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:10,450
actually give it the RGB value so if I

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:14,370
hit save and refresh I've got a nice

00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:16,270
pink block and that's not too hard to do

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,560
actually that's not hard to do at all

00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,150
but it starts to get a little bit

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,820
convoluted the more complex the sketch

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,160
gets so I've got an example here of how

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,340
to draw just a straight line so this is

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,089
gonna go from 50 across and 50 down to

00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,459
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,199
and a hundred down and it requires four

00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:34,899
lines of code I've got to begin the path

00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:37,480
I've got to declare the first set of

00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:39,490
coordinates I have to declare the second

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,249
set of coordinates and then I have to

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:53,920
tell it to actually draw that so when I

00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:55,569
hit refresh here if I saved so look that

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,189
wasn't hard you could all do that you

00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:59,470
could all follow along you you've got it

00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:01,089
but as your sketch is more complicated

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,949
that's gonna become a bit of a nightmare

00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:04,329
and if you are someone who's just

00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:06,249
learning code or just wants to make

00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:08,740
something in the end like that's gonna

00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:11,589
be really frustrating to work with so

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,329
that's where p5 comes in on p5 makes

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:20,259
this a lot this process a lot easier and

00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:21,699
a lot more intuitive so p5 so the first

00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,499
thing you've got to do is download the

00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:24,790
p5 libraries to your computer or you can

00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:26,920
get them via NPM

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,120
you could also use their p5 web editor

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,269
if you don't want to download anything

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:36,100
and then what you have to do is there's

00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:38,769
two main functions in in processing

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:42,279
there is the setup function and there is

00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:45,040
the draw function we don't have to

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,959
declare the canvas inside of the body of

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,079
the HTML because that's something that

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:53,319
p5 is gonna take care of us for us so

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,029
I'm gonna create a canvas I'm gonna make

00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:57,670
it the same size as the other one 500 by

00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:59,589
500 and when I want to change the

00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,860
background all I have to do is use the

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:06,970
syntax called background and fill in the

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:08,890
color that I want so that's already like

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,179
one line instead of two and it's a bit

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:14,490
more intuitive because you don't have to

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:17,649
build a whole new a whole new rectangle

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:21,039
so if I save that saving the wrong thing

00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:23,020
refresh now I've got that pink square if

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,110
I want to draw the line I just have to

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:28,809
use the syntax of line again more

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:31,059
intuitive and I need to put the first

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:34,929
coordinate so 50/50 followed by the

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:36,760
second coordinates so 100 hundred and if

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,710
i refresh there we go I've got the same

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,400
line again identical but it's a

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:44,120
significantly less code

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,830
and because it's got the two chunks so

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,110
the setup function happens one time and

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,430
one time only the draw function happens

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,320
again and again and again and it

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,150
continuously rewrites over the canvas

00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,860
it's actually going to be super easy to

00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,140
start doing animations and more complex

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,540
interactivity so what's actually

00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,660
happening here is if we were to look at

00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:05,660
the p5 like core files that you're

00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:08,300
downloading there's this for the line

00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:11,120
specifically we have a function that's

00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,740
already pre-made that basically runs

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,600
through that same code that we were

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,910
talking about earlier so begin path move

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,559
to line two and stroke so they've just

00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,790
taken care of that they've abstracted it

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,510
out to make it a little bit easier for

00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,650
you now if you wanted to start doing

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,120
things that were a little bit more

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,429
interactive you could add variables and

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,500
stuff you could add for loops and that

00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:35,090
would allow you to do animations so for

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:38,300
example if I do let X equal zero and

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:40,670
then let's make this I want to have it

00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:45,370
move by a factor of X every time the

00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:47,809
canvas is refreshed X plus equals 30

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:51,200
save and refresh and we should have a

00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:55,090
pretty cool animation going on okay it's

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:59,540
still pretty simple but we can also do

00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:03,050
different shapes so if I wanted to do an

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:05,780
ellipse and I can also use my mouse

00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:09,020
event so do stuff with externals really

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,330
easily I could get rid of the outline

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,400
that normally goes around an ellipse and

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:20,240
I could give it a some sort of fun color

00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:24,590
so fill blue that sounds pretty fun and

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,720
if I save that now and refresh tada

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:29,330
I have in three lines of code basically

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,630
created my own mspaint like right here

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,630
right now

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:38,550
thank you so yeah that was just like a

00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,440
two minute exercise I made I made a

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,660
mistake but what if we wanted to make it

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,570
a little bit more cool than that if we

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,890
doubled up on this ellipse for example

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,630
the fun thing about code as I mentioned

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,120
is that you can just sort of throw in

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,360
extra things and see what's cool so if I

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,470
try to add another fill ternt none other

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,670
ellipse to the page and then maybe I

00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:02,250
made the color random so this is gonna

00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,630
instead of giving me one value for red

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,000
it's gonna give me a different one every

00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,130
single time that the frame refreshes

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,020
like all of a sudden I have this like

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,830
really satisfying and kind of beautiful

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:16,230
like drawing tool and again this is just

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,670
a really simple like sort of example you

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,260
could extend on this like really easily

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:23,520
and make some really cool interactive

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:27,360
art pieces four minutes left okay so I'm

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:34,320
gonna just jump right into another

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:36,240
example okay so this one I'm not gonna

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,710
have a time to walk you through the code

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,540
but basically it's using that same

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,100
ellipse but instead of using the mouse

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,740
coordinates what if I were to use my

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,570
face so that's gonna create a new more

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:51,930
interesting sort of interaction with the

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:53,670
computer so if I go p5 pose net so this

00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:58,220
uses machine learning the machine

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,220
learning tensorflow das library Posen it

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:05,580
just cuts the load so right now instead

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:09,780
of drawing the ellipse on my mouse I've

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:11,520
actually got it drawing on my nose just

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,030
really satisfying and that didn't take a

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,150
ton of code I just had to use there's a

00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:20,010
really great website called friendly

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,500
machine learning for the web it was I

00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:24,090
think actually part of ITP which is

00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,280
related to processing like it's the

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,990
school in New York but Daniel Shipman

00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,160
the person I did that I showed you the

00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,560
YouTube pages for it I think he's

00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,980
involved with this project and so all I

00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:38,100
had to do was add this plug-in and this

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,230
little this little thing that's gonna

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,610
loop through anybody's that are on

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,050
screen it's gonna be like oh is there a

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,460
person there if so give me the

00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:48,899
coordinates of their nose

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,340
now okay this is still like not the

00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:52,919
coolest thing but I actually want to use

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,200
this like pose net in a real project of

00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:58,289
mine and so I decided to do some like

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,799
messing around with it the other day so

00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:05,549
I want to unveil to you my 80s music

00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:08,580
video generator which I hope it's gonna

00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:11,519
come up yes it works okay so for the

00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,300
very first time live in person is my

00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:17,950
coded music video

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:27,029
[Music]

00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:27,029
[Applause]

00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:37,040
I walk away it gets bored and it turns

00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:39,710
off and I don't even want to admit to

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:48,800
you how many times I practice that this

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:51,800
part of the presentation at home this is

00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,600
thank you this is just using that pote

00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,370
that same pose net basically the same

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,800
code I just showed you where instead of

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,510
doing a circle at the mouse I'm doing it

00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,190
at my face but I'm also doing it on

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,080
other points on my body and I'm

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,880
jittering the circle that's around my

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,380
head and all my shoulders to make it

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,790
look kind of cool the reason there's

00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,380
sort of ghost artifacts in the

00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,240
background is because I set the

00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,160
confidence level of the machine learning

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,260
tool to be really low so like it's

00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,930
basically like could that is there any

00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,940
possibility like out of like like is

00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,440
there is like one percent possibility

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,990
that's a human so when it sees my wrist

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,850
it's like oh that's a person let me draw

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,440
a person for you you could set that

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,630
higher so you wouldn't have it but I

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,480
kind of liked that it gave that sort of

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:35,360
weird psychedelic look so I'm running

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,950
out of time here so I just wanted to

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,540
reiterate what I've what have we learned

00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,460
today what have we covered so we talked

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,020
about creative coding and how it's art

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,780
based and inclusive at least if you ask

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,460
me you don't need to be an artist to do

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,840
it

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,150
p5 lets you bring processing

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,830
technologies to the web community

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,910
statements are awesome if you want to

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,580
get new people involved in your

00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:57,410
community and it's super easy to get set

00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:01,670
up and running as I demonstrated right

00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:03,290
here I hope that you guys maybe feel

00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,970
inspired to try it yourself I remember

00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,190
what I forgot to tell you earlier is

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:11,060
that you might learn something while

00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,830
you're doing it see though that was

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,390
important though is like pivotal because

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,650
you're not just sort of like missing

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,750
your own I mean you are you're messing

00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,520
around you're just like playing but at

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,020
the same time you might learn how to do

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,490
a new leg use something new in

00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,080
JavaScript you might learn how to use

00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,710
something like pose knit learn a bit

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,240
more about machine learning or you might

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,440
become more involved with the community

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,060
and be able to learn more about

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,830
mentorship through helping out other

00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,020
people through that community oriented

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,880
sort of discussion forums and such as

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,380
they have so if you do want to try it

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,250
you don't have to download anything you

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,200
can go to their web

00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,120
site and check out the p5 at web editor

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,050
if you want to download the pose net

00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:50,210
code it's on ml 5 je s org if you know

00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:54,170
someone young or want to pretend like

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:56,660
