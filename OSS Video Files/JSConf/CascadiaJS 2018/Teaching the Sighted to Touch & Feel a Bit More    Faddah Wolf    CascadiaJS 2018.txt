Playlist: CascadiaJS 2018
Description: 
	Braille is becoming more and more ubiquitous in many common spaces â€” airports, malls, libraries, etc. A college in Oregon needed an App built to help teach the friends & family of those who are sight impaired how to read Braille. Faddah Wolf will go over what accessibility options there are in common Mobile OS's, how he created a React Native six-key-input keyboard for Braille and how you can contribute to this Open Source project.

hey everybody I'm fought a wolf before

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,940
we get started this is all this is

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,370
pretty similar to my absolute last slide

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,320
with all this info so yeah get out your

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,540
cameras or really quickly type the notes

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,750
if you write down nothing else just get

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:23,460
that top link which is bit dot Lee slash

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,890
Fatih - Cascadia je s - 2018

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,550
that's bit dot Lee slash Fatih -

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:34,410
Cascadia je s - 2018 that's all these

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,960
slides sans that one link in PDF format

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,790
if you want to follow along alright I

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,500
want to do I do that because I noticed

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,420
we're all speaking really fast because

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,660
we're trying to cram everything we can

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,329
into 25 minutes I will try and do the

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,870
same all right so my talk is called

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,170
teaching decided to touch and feel a bit

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,960
more or a bit more empathy the react

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,320
native Braille 6 key input NPM package

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,979
that our team at the circus Inc created

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,400
for PSU Department called Universal

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:11,790
Design lab and for an app they want to

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,159
create it called unify ueb prep which a

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,350
ue b stands for unified english braille

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,320
which I'll get into and that's a picture

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,580
of the package in action right up there

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:27,330
in the top center so about me my name is

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,079
Fatih wolf that is my legal name I'm a

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,840
web and mobile app developer in

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,240
JavaScript at the circus Inc that's the

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,280
circus comm in Portland Oregon

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,829
that's the polish spelling by the way

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,600
because the owners of our building are a

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,939
Polish descent and they call the

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,649
building circ so we're the circus and I

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:52,290
ran away and joined the circus

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:54,540
and I am a totally stable genius if any

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,149
of you have a problem with my saying

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,640
that I would just say I'm as much of a

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,409
totally stable genius as anyone else who

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,790
feels the need to constantly claim that

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:08,879
they're a totally stable genius however

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:12,120
I'm not necessarily a react native or

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,900
NPM genius I had played a bit with react

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,780
native and I

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,580
some react stuff prior to joining the

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,629
circus I love that sing I joined the

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,819
circus and I knew I've known an npn I

00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,980
done some express stuff and such and I

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,980
downloaded and used NPM packages great

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,680
but I'd never done an NPM package myself

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,579
before these are all the ways you can

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,370
get in touch with me and a bit about me

00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:40,849
I tend to be on my off hours a streaming

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,590
binge junkie that's why the picture of

00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:46,950
the doctor Jodie Whittaker up is up

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,870
there I am Brad Baker I have my own

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,269
sourdough starter home I bake bread with

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,390
oh I thinking I need to feed that

00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:56,400
starter and I'm a bicyclist that bottom

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,579
thing is me at the end of the Seattle to

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,720
Portland ride three years ago and I am a

00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:05,849
beer snob no PBR for me thank you so

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,859
before we get into the main part of the

00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:09,870
talk I want to ask you guys to

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:13,109
participate in a little experiment with

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:17,099
me you don't have to participate folks

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:19,380
if you don't want to but if you do I'm

00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:22,410
going to ask you to get out your smart

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,139
device be it a iPhone or Android or a

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:28,590
tablet or an iPad or whatever and I'm

00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:32,720
going to ask you to lock the screen so

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:36,739
it goes blank and then close your eyes

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,840
with your eyes closed just by touch

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,819
unlock the screen now if you have one of

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,480
those fingerprint sensors that should be

00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:49,019
easy if you've got like the modern it

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,370
checks your face you can just turn it

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,160
toward your face with your eyes closed

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,889
if you want then once you think you have

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,650
it open try and do a simple task open a

00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:02,419
message an SMS message and try to start

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:05,160
typing in an SMS message or a notepad or

00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:08,129
open your mail find the icon that opens

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,660
your mail and begin to try and touch and

00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:14,150
see where messages are how's that going

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,750
for everybody

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,729
I thought so so what's this all about

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,009
I'm here to describe to you a new NPM

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:23,840
package for react native that we made

00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:26,810
because we created the app and react

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,930
native it for a keyboard for Braille six

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:32,240
key input I'm going to talk about how we

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,550
get got here or why we created this in

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,310
particular I'm going to talk about the

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,410
road to getting there which is as Sir

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,780
Paul said a long and winding road many

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,210
twists and turns and now with even more

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,430
crushing to fit defeats yet triumphant

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,020
via victories and I'm also going to talk

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,240
about the future of it and how you folks

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,800
can contribute to this open source NPM

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,630
package before I go any further

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,850
Marcy mentioned accessibility and I'm

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,949
very much especially since working on

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,789
this before this me and knowing

00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:06,680
accessibility and Al Evan why not much

00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:08,810
and in fact I haven't worked very much

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,599
on that part of this product that we're

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,360
working on and so it when people said

00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:15,949
well as you're talking to me about

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,970
accessibility in a 11y my first reaction

00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:20,870
was to go no because I just didn't know

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,789
that much about it

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:26,539
except there has been a person he's an

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:29,320
intern working on that part on the app

00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:32,449
and I will talk about it a bit later

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,159
also I didn't want to talk about it much

00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:37,130
because it's kind of known that react

00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:40,099
native is very what or used to be very

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:43,550
limited in how it handled accessibility

00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:46,580
in a 11y it was extremely limited and

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,830
people weren't happy about it but then I

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,180
I did a little bit more searching I

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,539
thought well maybe we can incorporate

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,130
some of that in here I wanted to call

00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:57,740
everyone's attention to an article I

00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,520
recently read it's on LinkedIn it's

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,260
written by a MS Zeki Chen she's a

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,680
computer science and business major at

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,050
UC Berkeley and for a few months she was

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,210
an intern at Facebook working on react

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,810
native particularly on the accessibility

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,789
API for react native and she talks about

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,490
in this that's the link to the article

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:21,470
right up there so feel free to look it

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,659
up it's a very good article she talks

00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,090
about what the original limitations were

00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:27,000
that people were complaining about she

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,130
talked about the

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,570
sighing decisions when she was an intern

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,460
that the team made and how they

00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,530
implemented them and how you can begin

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,510
to use them now so I highly recommend

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,580
this article and I think we're gonna be

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:44,040
going over it and implementing a lot

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:47,310
into our app so how did we get here well

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:52,550
first before I ran off and joined the

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:55,740
circus as I said mid 2017 to late 2017

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,770
dr. Samuelson OTT and dr. Holly Lawson

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:03,000
their PhDs at Portland State University

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:05,220
they Sam runs the universal design lab

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,810
that's the links for all that and they

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:13,020
wanted to create an app to help families

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,930
and allies and friends of people who are

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,930
sight impaired learn Braille right at

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:21,120
least beginning that was what our goal

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,220
was with this app and this is the little

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,930
website that we created for them that

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,870
last link on the last slide goes to this

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:31,560
site is sort of announcing the app hope

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:35,100
we've got Sam has gotten his enterprise

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,360
accounts for Google Play and iOS now and

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,400
as soon as he gets the marketing

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,520
materials this app should be released on

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,990
the App Store's in the next few weeks

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,940
and so we were going to create this app

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,850
for them and this was created based on

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,430
mock-ups by the owner of our agency Juan

00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:54,000
Fernandez he's a amazing graphic artist

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,100
and he and so we were going to begin

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,880
work on this and then I was hired in

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,130
February of this year 2018 to do some

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,760
web work with them but mostly to really

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:11,580
laser focus on this react native app for

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:15,360
PSU so of course I was just getting my

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:18,630
feet wet in react native and such so I

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,000
couldn't do this alone that's my CTO and

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,610
boss and he's also a co-owner and senior

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,370
partner at the circus that's Ryan

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,050
Anderson I hope next year in the next

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,610
couple of years he does a call for a

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,789
proposal here because the guy's a

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,990
freaking genius he really is I rely on

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:38,640
him for so much and I really admire him

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,169
also that's the intern I was talking

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,349
about from PSU

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:46,170
dr. Senate Sam he he found him he's a

00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:48,209
computer science major PSU and he's

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,130
helping us and he's the one who began to

00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:52,250
incorporate a lot of the accessibility

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,950
so some of the commands within the app

00:08:52,250 --> 00:09:00,060
could be spoken and then there's me

00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:03,269
working diligently every day in on the

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,100
app so what were some of the

00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:07,980
requirements of this app well it needed

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,550
to run on smartphones and tablets on

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,350
Apple iOS and Google Android now I'm

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,120
running out of everywhere on you know

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,570
tablets iPads everywhere

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,160
send so of course Ryan the CTO and the

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,430
rest of the screen well let's do react

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:29,490
native it right once runs on both iOS

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:32,339
and Android forever right right we'll

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,589
talk more about that in a minute it

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,810
needs to be responsive on all sizes of

00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,750
screens and phones and tablets it needs

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:42,300
to have interactive exercises that can

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:46,079
be logged and people get awards or the

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,209
the admin on the backend can see what

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:50,459
exercises and courses people have

00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:53,910
completed and that included a keyboard

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:56,220
to input six dot Braille characters

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,199
which is what you see in the universal

00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,699
English Braille there have been two

00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:02,820
grades of that by the way there's been

00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:07,170
grade one and now we're on grade two of

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:10,320
ueb the Braille input should not cover

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:12,120
over parts of the screen in the app with

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,800
which the user is tried interact just

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,510
like when you bring up a keyboard in

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,820
notepad as you'll see me do in a moment

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,019
it should not cover the whole screen you

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,500
should be able to see what you're typing

00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:25,579
and you should be able to touch all the

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,410
buttons in the Braille cell at once and

00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:30,569
make any Braille character in the six

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,550
dots that is possible using multi-touch

00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:37,260
and it should all be a seamless

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,810
experience right and I know some of you

00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,839
who know accessibility and a11y much

00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:45,389
better than I are going wait fada does

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,300
an apple iOS and Google Android have

00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:49,610
similar accessibility controls for the

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,560
site impaired

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,810
well yeah

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,149
Google Android has this thing called

00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,709
Braille back it's not part of the OS

00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:02,730
it's a separate free app you can

00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:05,279
download and the problem with that is it

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,800
expects you to have your own external

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,589
Braille keyboard they make these

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,999
accessibility keyboards for people who

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,249
are cycling pared who want to type

00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:18,089
Braille maybe you've seen some people

00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:21,839
use them I will say they are kind of

00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:24,029
expensive Android also has a thing

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,189
called G board which is their

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:29,040
internationalization the ability to type

00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:33,540
in many different languages using the

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:36,360
Android G board and someone in a forearm

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,459
or in some Stack Overflow post I read

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,809
said and it can do Braille I said really

00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:41,550
and I started going through and looking

00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:44,189
up everything I could find Google

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,709
searches and Stack Overflow about G

00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:49,709
board and I could not find a Braille

00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:52,050
library for it I could be wrong I don't

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:54,600
I'm a fully admit that I don't know that

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,970
much about it so if someone knows if

00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,509
there's an ability to do Braille through

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:03,389
G board please let me know Apple iOS

00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:05,220
it's built baked into the system with

00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,029
the accessibility controls through the

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,529
general control panel and with voiceover

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:13,680
so I'm going to give you an example of

00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:15,209
this now I'm gonna unplug here and plug

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,980
this into my phone so you'll see my

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:18,809
phone screen they're gonna need to turn

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,790
this off for a second so because I don't

00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:24,240
want to cause seizures in the audience

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:27,149
from the screen flashing alright and let

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,939
me get to the app I want so I haven't

00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:33,360
set up I I haven't set it up already so

00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:36,689
three clicks on the power button brings

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,790
up voiceover and then using the rotor

00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:42,420
which you can set in those accessibility

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:45,240
Croke controls and general settings you

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,759
can switch to a keyboard so just like a

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,379
regular keyboard you have these things

00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,929
any but you can still see your screen

00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,699
above etc but now I'm going to turn

00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:56,899
voice over on I'm going to hold this up

00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:56,899
so you guys can hear it

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:07,330
voiceover on notes no text field is

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,330
editing character mode

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:17,780
let's do new one there we go

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:20,480
and now here's the voiceover on no no

00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,940
bring off-screen input or escape there's

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:32,000
a bubble to the left table top mode

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:35,120
contract a b c d alright voiceover off

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,030
that's a good example of that and i am

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,600
now going to switch back so that you can

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,430
continue and if you're not a sight

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,970
impaired person who's had to get used to

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:49,160
using a device with sort of okay Google

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,290
or Alexa or a Siri barking back at you

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,650
constantly that can be a bit

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,820
disconcerting and annoying right and we

00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,720
want something that was a little bit

00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:02,060
more seamless so I said let's make it an

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,490
NPM package and open source it and they

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,810
said yeah and we're all excited because

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,610
we're now I'm making my first

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:11,900
MTM package and they're gonna help me

00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:16,280
and this is gonna be great right and so

00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:18,320
there it is the NPM package that's the

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,420
link if you want to go take a look at it

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,130
it's up there it's got to read me for it

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:28,400
and here is the related github

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,960
repository now the github repository has

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,280
one thing that the package does and

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,340
that's if you see at the top there's a

00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,650
little app thing that's an expo app that

00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,260
allows you to test and see the thing

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,810
working and I'm gonna unplug this again

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,780
and plug it into the phone and we're

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:47,450
gonna see the expo app working this is

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,760
silent because the app itself doesn't

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,530
have any I mean the package itself

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,140
doesn't have accessibility but you can

00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:59,120
add that into what other app you put it

00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:00,920
in so here it is working hopefully there

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,560
it is alright so there you go the

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:08,660
Braille six key input in action there's

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:13,179
a name there's a B there's a see there's

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:16,399
a D there's an e alright you can delete

00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,699
or you can clear the whole thing you

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,299
know

00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:27,579
and that's doing just standard Braille

00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:27,579
all right I'm gonna switch back now so

00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:36,079
there we go that was working great so

00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:38,660
far and we got the interface and the

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,699
touch working fairly well and we were

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,709
testing it in expo on iOS and it was

00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:45,079
looking and we figured out be the same

00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:50,059
on Android and so everything's ready

00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:53,029
right but not quite there is as you go

00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:56,749
between platforms like I said many

00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:59,389
twists and turns initial tests on Apple

00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:00,769
iOS said eh okay ready so we were kind

00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:06,769
of feeling yeah let's go

00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:11,480
MVP ship at until we began to test on

00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:13,929
Android not so much

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:18,079
some of the problems we initially had

00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:22,220
Braille fonts those who know Braille you

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:25,669
that's let me see a be a see us that's

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:28,519
the word abacus right there I have

00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:31,999
learned a bit since February I wanted to

00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:35,449
show you that over here what we did was

00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:37,549
I did a kind of test in code pen and

00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:42,439
kind of shown all sorts of different

00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:43,850
fonts working we have source sans sim

00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:45,919
Braille which comes from the American

00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,069
publishing house for the blind with

00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,169
their Braille blaster program they have

00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:53,480
for translating Braille we tried source

00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:56,679
sans and Apple Gothic and other things

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,779
that had Braille in them and what Holly

00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:01,429
dr. Holly Lawson wanted was these

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:02,839
wonderful little things called ghost

00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:04,519
dots and she wanted the Braille large

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,220
enough of course on phone screens and

00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:09,289
tablets that people could read it

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:14,059
especially if they weren't fully sight

00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:17,149
impaired but mostly sight impaired so

00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:18,769
okay we we we did some testing through

00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:21,889
this and even though these all look

00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:23,929
great here what we found is some of them

00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:26,339
just don't show up with the ghost bot

00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:30,090
dots even if we do react native

00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:32,100
link of the font once we import it even

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,289
if we do that some just don't show the

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:38,760
goats box dots the one that worked on

00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:41,370
both Apple iOS and Android Apple Braille

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:45,570
once you react native link it it worked

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:50,580
great so let's go back here so that

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:52,350
problem solved then we had the

00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,600
responsiveness in portrait versus

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,880
landscape and different screen sizes for

00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,270
different screen sizes if it wasn't

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,470
doing well with the react native style

00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:06,840
sheets no matter what we did we had to

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,909
make certain helper functions to check

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:14,070
is this an iPhone 10 which is a much

00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:16,080
larger dots per inch screen is this is

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,970
this an iPad we did a little helper

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,080
functions and then we would redo redo

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,850
the style sheets based on that and I

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,029
also found this wonderful package react

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:31,500
native responsive style sheet to show

00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:33,899
you in our app that working here is like

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:37,649
the style sheets down here first you

00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:44,429
import it once it's in your package JSON

00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:46,260
you import it using the important

00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:48,870
statement up here and then down here at

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:53,429
the very bottom we have the style sheet

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:55,620
there's there's the regular normal

00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:58,409
styles using the responsive style sheet

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,919
create and then below there are the

00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:03,240
responsive styles if your normal styles

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,399
are what you want in portrait you can

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,370
just leave the Portland port the

00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:09,929
portrait is empty objects and then any

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,570
variations in landscape you can put in

00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:15,000
there that will register and I'm going

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:21,539
to unplug and plug back in again just to

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:27,240
show you real quick so with this in you

00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:29,730
can see it working like that and that's

00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:35,460
the react native spot a style sheet

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:38,700
unplugging again thank you oh you didn't

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:44,850
see it I'm apologize

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:50,360
quick let's wait till they it's plugged

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:54,470
back in there we go alright so here

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:58,110
there you go everyone see that all right

00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,880
thanks for keeping me honest and unplug

00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,200
again I have to tell them that so they

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,840
you don't see a whole bunch of flicker

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:15,480
screen alright I'm plugged back into

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:19,650
this area so that problem solved so then

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,810
there was the question of you know being

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,570
able to touch all the buttons at once to

00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:28,620
make all the Braille characters and of

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:33,000
course we all know that as lordy poss no

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:35,730
multi-touch so there are two choices

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,670
here a couple the first was and I'll

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:41,360
show this to you the react native

00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:44,490
gesture responders system API here it is

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,440
and it starts out pretty good and yeah

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,350
I'm reading through it and my boss Ryan

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,360
the genius saying you should use gesture

00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,860
responder system for multi-touch and I

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,920
kept reading through and I saw these

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,350
props that you attach to the view in

00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,910
react native I'm going yeah but there's

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,080
not many examples in fact there's no

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:05,610
examples and oh and I got to learn

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,740
location Y and location X and geometry

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,360
math and I started to get scared and I

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,790
said there's got to be an easy way to do

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,830
easier way to do this so I came back

00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,390
here and I did some searching in Google

00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,390
and Stack Overflow and I found

00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:20,040
oh well JavaScript itself has touched

00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:23,820
things there's the touchstart touchmove

00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,680
touch n that you can add to an add event

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,950
listener with a callback function of

00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,230
what you want it to do or in modern

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:34,500
JavaScript you can do on touch start on

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:37,230
touch move on touch end and I tried

00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,710
those and in the expo app and on iOS

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,090
working great and we're like yes ok

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,610
don't have to deal with that just your

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:49,310
responders stuff at all yeah I did it

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:52,440
and then we tried testing on Android and

00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:54,450
it's not react natives in the face

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,000
folk or Android swans just Android

00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,890
handles touch gestures and multi-touch

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,370
gestures in a different way and

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:05,820
different heuristics than iOS does to

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:07,620
which my boss Ryan went duh and he said

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:13,980
remember when I said you should maybe

00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:18,240
try the gesture responder system so we

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,890
so I party jumping ahead so we did and

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,650
I'm just gonna really quick show you the

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:29,430
gesture responders system as part of

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:31,290
this it's so in the view here this is

00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,540
the enclosing view around all these

00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:39,750
little Braille input components we made

00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:42,230
here we have the in the six key input as

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,730
part of the package we have the view

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,250
views have layout and you can do a call

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,410
back function on layout which allows you

00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,060
to get locations of everything on the

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,040
screen I'll show you that in a sec and

00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:57,240
here are the gesture responder stuff

00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:59,700
it's on on start should set responder on

00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,830
respond or move on respond or release

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,170
just props on view doesn't have to be a

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:06,180
touchable view or a touchable opacity or

00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,640
anything like that it can be just a

00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,250
regular view that's now set to respond

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,170
to multi touches here are the functions

00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,140
I was telling you about here's the on

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:18,150
layout that we call the on layout gets a

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,950
native event which contains a layout

00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:24,630
that has all sorts of stuff and then we

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:26,490
use a layout measure method that react

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,980
native supplies and we do a call back to

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,140
that and say take that stuff in the

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,900
native object it's going to have the X&Y

00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,130
of the component itself where it starts

00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,260
it's going to have its width and height

00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,750
and it's going to have the absolute page

00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,790
X and page Y on the screen where it's

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,770
located and then we put that in two

00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:46,680
state variables just what we need the

00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:49,560
page X goes to X page Y goes to Y width

00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:53,880
and height and and you can see that's

00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:58,500
our state variable right there so down

00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,330
here in the move callback this is what

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,380
happened we take a native event there

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,530
that records the change touches we say

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,440
get

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,330
to get that the that X Y width and

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,570
height we put into the state variable of

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,980
layout create a test array and if

00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,830
there's anything already in the test

00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:20,520
array put it in there

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:23,760
and then we say change touches based on

00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:27,090
their position in the as we loop through

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,270
in the array go into page X and page Y

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,860
and a constant here we create these

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,710
variables and set them to zero and then

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,780
this is something my genius CTO came up

00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:39,950
with he bases this is the he helped me

00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:43,590
out doing the Y and X math so if this

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:46,710
this is the Y up and down so if it's

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,510
this much it's the third button if it

00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,650
it's the third set of row of third

00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,480
buttons if it's this much

00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,700
it's the row of second buttons if it's

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,360
this much it's the row of first buttons

00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:00,420
and down here this is the X so if it's

00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,820
this it's three if it's this one it's

00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:05,940
the ones on the left one the ones and

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,530
then we put all that into a thing we

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,660
call button touch array and then we do a

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,850
switch on it and say if it's one one

00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,590
that's the one button on the left is if

00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,230
it's one two that's the two button the

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,760
right except etc all the way down to six

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:21,000
and that's how we did the multi-touch

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,550
and so I was very excited to learn that

00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,080
and very grateful that he made me do the

00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:27,270
hard work and go all the way through

00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:32,060
that all right

00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:36,540
there is one thing left that we ran into

00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:38,520
most human beings not all but most human

00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:42,900
beings are born with how many fingers on

00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:45,390
each hand five right and so what is a

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,570
limitation on both iOS and Android of

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:53,420
the total number of fingers that can

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:56,850
touch a screen at once for phones five

00:25:53,420 --> 00:26:00,270
that's all it'll take on phones tablets

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,290
and iPads we'll take more but the phones

00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:04,440
that's it

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:06,750
and that really ticked us off because in

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:10,890
Universal English Braille grade 2 there

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:12,930
is an all 6 character that you need to

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,560
do as a modifier to describe other

00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,450
characters in the contracted Braille and

00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,799
but

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,840
I'm gonna unplug and show you really

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,240
quick we found a workaround thanks to

00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,159
Ryan insisting that I do the hard work

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:32,269
and do the gesture responder Swift

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:33,950
system plugged in and what we can do

00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:40,220
because we're using just your responder

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:42,230
we do one two three four five right but

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,669
not won't take anymore I'm hitting six

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,070
nothing happened but then I can lift off

00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:48,830
of five if five is still part of the

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:51,169
array that we're building I touch six

00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:53,779
with that finger release there's the

00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:59,299
full thing so we did find a good

00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:59,750
workaround for it gonna unplug again all

00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:06,830
right

00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:08,480
so finishing up so I think we've all

00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:13,570
learned something here today don't you

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:16,720
oh there it goes

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,720
there we go

00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:22,080
wait that slide doesn't look quite right

00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,940
that's better

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:29,170
all right so there's this open-source

00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:31,840
package for 6ki braille ueb input in

00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:33,520
react native it's an alternative

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,600
solution to the OS platform

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:40,030
accessibility in apps as I said the road

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,270
to making things work the same in both

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:46,300
react native and Apple iOS and Google

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:49,480
Android is not the happy rainbow sparkle

00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,970
Playland you'd think and it's open

00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,950
source so we're saying please four can

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:56,620
contribute if you're going to contribute

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:59,380
directly to this project email is on the

00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,700
github and the and the NPM repository

00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,470
and we ask you write us first to make

00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,760
sure as as maintained as we want to make

00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:06,550
sure it's the direction we want the

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,140
package to go but if you want a fork and

00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,550
use it for something else that's what

00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:13,860
you could do for instance we made this

00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:16,540
react native maybe you want a fork and

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,300
refactor the code for just regular react

00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,160
for the web maybe you want to reef just

00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,310
read it and go over it and do something

00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:27,270
similar for angular for view hey Yahoo

00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:29,680
de was here yesterday for ember you know

00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,840
we you know there's all sorts of things

00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,930
that one of my next projects after we do

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,080
the release for like 1:1 or 1/5 is in

00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:40,570
landscape on tablets we want to have the

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,950
fingers buttons at an angle because

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,050
that's the way most people will be

00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:47,680
touching the screen so we want to make

00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:51,010
it easier for them but wait there's more

00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:53,440
that app itself ueb prep we want to make

00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:56,440
it into an open-source framework for any

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,560
sort of education training handbook etc

00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,260
its experience it's got a from the front

00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,440
end react native app and it has a

00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:07,930
back-end admin which has a front-end for

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,210
the web that's in react native web and

00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:13,770
we use storybook to check the components

00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:16,390
there and the backend of it is using AWS

00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:19,810
lambda with with server list which is a

00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:22,360
