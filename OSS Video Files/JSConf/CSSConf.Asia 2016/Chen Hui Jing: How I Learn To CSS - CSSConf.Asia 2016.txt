Title: Chen Hui Jing: How I Learn To CSS - CSSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-10
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	Most of us regularly read web development articles or watch videos that talk about the latest web features, or techniques for implementing all the things and so on. I don't know about you, after almost 3 decades of existence, I realised I'm more of a learn-by-doing kind of person.
Building little components from scratch is a great way to cement your knowledge of CSS properties and try out all those cool things you've read or heard about. You never know when it might come in handy...

	00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:16,189
hello everyone today I'm going to talk

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,009
about how I learned to CSS

00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:22,519
I'm also paranoid about my presentation

00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:24,800
malfunctioning half way so if you okay

00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,869
if you want to scan the QR code and load

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,779
the slides on your mobile device feel

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:32,360
free to do so now I've talked to a lot

00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:34,129
of people about CSS and a number of them

00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,739
have told me that they they don't like

00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:38,720
CSS that CSS is hard to wrap their head

00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:42,290
around so I'm gonna share with you how I

00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,930
wrap my head around CSS now the purpose

00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,670
of CSS is to make stuff on the web look

00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,159
good I mean you can't have cascading

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,500
style sheets without spell right but I

00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,119
also see CSS as a means of creative

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,640
expression I mean some people like to

00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:59,809
write some people paint some people make

00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,030
music I like to CSS now as with any

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,489
creative endeavor we need some

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,320
inspiration well the CSS specification

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,240
if you print it out I don't know maybe

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,670
it's this thick so there's a lot of

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,490
stuff in there for us to explore and

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,580
play with many people myself included

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,610
write articles about CSS some of us even

00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,500
write books so read those because they

00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,880
usually come with code examples that you

00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,360
can fork off and play around with

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,070
yourself podcasts now I'm sure a lot of

00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,260
you commute in some way or another

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,090
I personally commute by bicycle so

00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,250
there's not a lot of things I can do

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,750
with my hands or my eyes technically

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,150
this applies if you're driving as well

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,400
but your ears are free and there are a

00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,260
lot of good web development podcasts out

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,930
there that discuss the latest trends

00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,150
techniques new stuff which is perfect

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,159
for finding out about new stuff and also

00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:53,090
discovering old stuff that you never

00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:55,370
knew existed and if you're anything like

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,800
me you might find confidence a tad

00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,270
expensive I mean maybe I'm up here

00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,620
because I was too cheap to pay for a

00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:05,810
ticket joking kind of and a lot of the

00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,750
conference's including this one actually

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:12,560
put up videos of the talks online after

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,150
the fact so if you want to skip over the

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,040
face to face interaction with

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,730
like-minded people or the prospect of

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,280
meeting your

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,530
pelipper idols then go ahead just watch

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,659
the free videos online there's really a

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,440
ton of good content there and then just

00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:29,750
start building stuff now ooh no crap

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,970
oona credits once it is on her excellent

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,160
podcast PS you must subscribe to it

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,840
people go to conferences to get inspired

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,580
and learn about things that exist or

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,900
maybe an overview of how to use it but

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,220
then they really learn that thing that

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,200
technology when they go home and

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,379
practice it themselves so that's what I

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,299
hope that I can I can do today that at

00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:48,980
the end of the day at the end of all

00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:51,140
these excellent talks that you too will

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,480
be inspired to go home and CSS something

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,459
yourself but building stuff is not

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,910
enough you really ought to share what

00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:00,620
you've built with the world because well

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,810
you can do this in two ways you can

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,579
either write write about it or you can

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,769
talk about it because when you do that

00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:09,140
you're forced to explain stuff and this

00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:13,340
really makes you learn about what

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,750
exactly what's going on so who's this

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,150
person standing in front of you talking

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,650
about CSS I mean I should introduce me a

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,879
bit so my first name is swaging

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,829
I'm a self-taught designer and developer

00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,489
I work at a company called deep that and

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:27,650
I write blog posts from time to time so

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,959
I put some stuff recently and Here I am

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,370
sharing it with all of you because I

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,650
only have 15 minutes I'm just gonna

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,780
cover some key points only first up is

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,000
what I call over-the-top video buttons

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,950
so I watched a video of ether and more

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,139
cots excellent talk at an event part

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,540
earlier this year linked in this light

00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,069
and I was particularly enamored with his

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,169
demo demonstrating progressively

00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:49,940
enhanced radio buttons now one thing

00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:52,760
about conference talks is unless the

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,250
speaker is live coding the code snippets

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,410
that we show you are just a tiny snippet

00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,730
of the key functionality I learned that

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,379
the hard way because I was like oh

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,000
there's not a lot of code here I could

00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,980
probably build this in half an hour

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,910
wrong took me at least I don't know

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,400
three days and maybe more but these are

00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:14,540
cool takeaways I got from trying to

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:19,190
build this demo students which so here's

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:21,349
the demo so it's essentially just radio

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,539
buttons but there's some animation going

00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,490
on there's some sliding and some zooming

00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:28,340
you can clear your selection and

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,180
everything just slides back this is all

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,850
powered by CSS

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,770
javascript involved in this demo is to

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,259
add and remove classes so then there's

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,479
also this slight pause the animation

00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,060
thing Sarah actually touched on

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,479
animations earlier so the crux of this

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,639
demo is a technique called the check box

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,740
hack so I'm sure all of us have built

00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,870
HTML forms before and we should know

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,880
that form control elements like inputs

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,039
should have an Associated label element

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,900
so you can do this in two ways you can

00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:59,580
either have the label contain the input

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,650
or you can use the for attribute on the

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,509
label which points to the ID of the

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,340
input element I actually found out

00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:07,020
recently that the second method is

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,849
recommended because some assistive

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,160
technologies don't work properly with

00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:13,139
the wrapping method so now when you

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,720
click the label it's as if you clicked

00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,550
and checked the radio button and because

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,650
you can use images as part of the label

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,889
not only text you can actually get

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,320
really fancy with the label so then when

00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,509
a radio button or checkbox is checked we

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,190
have a check pseudo class that we can

00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:32,099
play with so together with some

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,570
combinators either sibling selectors or

00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,699
child selectors depending on how you

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,190
wrote your HTML we can have some fun

00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,530
with the state change so we can have

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,960
some animation as Sarah mentioned

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,340
earlier the way browsers work now there

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,639
are only two things that can be animated

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,199
cheaply transforms and opacity and both

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,180
of which I use in this demo so that

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,750
sliding thing that you saw earlier that

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,030
was translate X and I used it with some

00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,210
end child selectors so my four options

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,430
were laid out with flexbox actually in a

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,669
single row so they're only going to move

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,889
along the x-axis and the selected option

00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:09,810
always ends up in the second position so

00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:13,080
we can set up some positioning rules

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,789
using entrant selectors so if the first

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,280
option is checked it will always move

00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:20,310
one position to the right so I can use

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,169
translate X 100% to do that and for the

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,900
third and fourth they're always going to

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:27,210
move one or two positions respectively

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,720
to the left so we'll use a negative

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,820
percentage for the translate X and then

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,860
there's the zooming bit so basically

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,720
what I have more two disks that were

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,909
stacked on top of each other along the

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,620
z-axis so if you peek into my source

00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:42,230
code you'll see some Z index rules

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,710
thrown in there

00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:48,470
and the use of the knot selector here is

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,940
helpful because what happens is that the

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,830
stuff that you want to display when

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,960
checked is hidden from view at first and

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,140
I did this by setting the opacity to

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,940
zero and scaling it down to nothing so

00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,000
when you check one option you want the

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:04,130
other three to disappear and the istrict

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,380
class is only added to the selector

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,100
option while the other three without end

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,840
up getting these height from view

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,690
properties because they are not is

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,820
checked so the classes that are prefixed

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,860
with is are added and removed by

00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,420
JavaScript and those were those are the

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,840
only things that the JavaScript is doing

00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,240
in this demo and then transitions so

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,870
transitions or what pull this whole demo

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,430
together because without them your my

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,710
options will just jump into place

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,380
there's none none of that smooth you

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,060
know sliding and zooming and I use

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,100
transitions quite often I think it's

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,020
quite commonly used and but one thing

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,090
that I actually never used before this

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,640
demo is the transition delay property

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,440
and you use it to specify the amount of

00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,330
time the browser waits from the time you

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,220
request the animation to when the

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,800
animation actually starts so it turns

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,840
out that very slight pause it's a 0.1

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,820
second pause actually does make a

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,980
difference so I have this demo up on

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,570
quote pen and you can fork it and mess

00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,540
around with the timing just to see the

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,760
effect right so I watched another talk

00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,220
now this talk was by Harry Roberts on

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,620
structuring your CSS it was great there

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:16,100
was some way involved the sandwich not

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:18,590
the trains but his point was your CSS

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,540
classes shouldn't be monolithic because

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,330
that's actually creating a single point

00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,430
of failure so you handle layout

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,010
separately from component Styles and

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,270
have specialized JavaScript books so if

00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,190
you change the visual style of a

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,450
component by maybe changing classes

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,310
you're not going to break any

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:38,780
functionality so that's the reason why I

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:40,340
have this disparate classes here and

00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,640
someone pointed out to me that I should

00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,900
really make my demo keyboard accessible

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,390
well I'm gonna preface that I'm not very

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,040
good at accessibility right now so I'm

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,860
still learning from people like Chris

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,380
about how to do this well unfortunately

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,730
I couldn't come up with a solution for

00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,680
making the checkbox heck

00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,630
keyboard accessible so if any of you do

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,930
please come and talk to me about it

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:05,510
but the next best idea I had was to have

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,329
a toggle so you can turn the app you can

00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:10,910
turn the animation off you can just fall

00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:16,399
back to a normal so this is just your

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:17,750
basic normal radio buttons and for those

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,089
of you who have actually never tried

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,980
navigating a forum with keyboard know

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:24,110
that you use tap to jump between

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,420
elements you use the arrow keys to

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,970
navigate between options and if it's a

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:33,380
checkbox you use space key to select and

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,730
unselect your options so the source code

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,910
and the quote pen link if you're

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:41,449
interested right so one more demo this

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,760
one is what I call a CSS album art so I

00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:46,010
came across this blog post by a designer

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,959
come musician he's called Scott Hanson

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,209
and he was outlining his design process

00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,430
for album covers and I noticed that in

00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:54,820
his design for some of his covers was

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,010
pretty minimalist you know just shapes

00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,889
shapes that can be created only using

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:05,660
CSS so here's the demo and as you can

00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:08,750
see the the covers are really simply

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,760
just shapes so these are all created

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:15,139
using just ESS there's no images

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:17,779
involved and for some reason I thought

00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:21,410
that it'd be cool to try doing this in

00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:23,420
just with just one single diff so I

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,779
definitely needed some help with from

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,760
pseudo elements so when you have the you

00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,500
can use the before and the after pseudo

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,600
elements so now I have like a total of

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,149
three elements to play with the thing

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,250
about pseudo elements is that you it

00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:39,949
must have the content property in order

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,260
for it to work and the content cannot be

00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:44,510
blank you have to have at least empty

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,630
codes so zero elements are considered

00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:51,500
inserted content so what what happens is

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:54,170
that sorry what happens is that it's not

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,000
visible in the pages source so ideally

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,000
you don't want to have any critical

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,310
content that is inserted into your your

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,019
website in this way but for decorative

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,140
things like what I'm doing right now I

00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,470
think it's it's it's still fine so here

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,930
we go

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,590
shapes with CSS so it's gonna start off

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,860
with something

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:14,930
simple this be a circle the

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,870
border-radius is obviously the key

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,120
property here but one thing is I also

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,040
wanted to make my demo responsive so

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,440
none of that fixed with stuff no no

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,620
we're gonna use viewport units for this

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,029
so what viewport units are is these are

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,960
units that are relative to the height

00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:34,760
and width of your viewport and the V min

00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,040
unit that I'm using here actually is

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,430
based on your current viewport width or

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,310
height depending on whichever is smaller

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,740
so next rape actually I want to talk

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,200
about is a triangle so you can create

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:51,020
triangles with CSS using the border

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,460
property so unlike if unlike me you had

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,779
better things to do with your life

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,180
you've probably never done this before

00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:59,540
but say create a div of any size you

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,790
choose 200 pixels square for example and

00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,279
then you apply a different color thick

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,440
border to each of the four sides so so

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,270
maybe about 30 pixels you'll see that

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,380
the edges of the border actually meet

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:14,660
diagonally so now if your div does not

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,780
have a height or a width then you're

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,430
left with 4 triangles and so you see you

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,480
can have triangles of different

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:27,260
directions and with that we can create

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,750
different CSS triangles so for this case

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,920
it's a right facing triangle so all you

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,770
have to do is to make the adjacent

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:37,180
borders transparent so for this one my

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:40,400
top and border are transparent while the

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,860
desired color is applied to the border

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,220
left you can even change the width of

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:49,370
the border to change the shape of your

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,060
triangle so the next shape is a

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,370
trapezium

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,589
I consider this a cop-out shape because

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,620
it's actually just a regular diff with

00:12:54,589 --> 00:13:01,100
it it just snipped off with CSS clip

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:05,180
path CSS clip path uses the same polygon

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:07,220
syntax as SVG's and as CSS shapes with

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,860
each point being a coordinate relative

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,200
to the width and the height of the diff

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,690
unfortunately clip path is not supported

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,270
in any of the Microsoft browsers but

00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:19,010
it's currently under consideration in

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,649
the masking module so I think you can

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:25,959
probably vote for this

00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:28,959
we're okay this is a fun one so on some

00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:32,610
of the covers I'm gonna switch back you

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,139
can see a series of dots at the site so

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:39,550
not this one

00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:41,980
so those those series of dots those were

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,379
actually done using the what I call the

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,720
box shadow trick so I came across this

00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:49,629
fantastic site showcasing really

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,009
interesting single day of CSS creations

00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:54,279
and when I first saw it I was like

00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:56,230
that's not possible that how do you own

00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:58,329
or do you actually do that with one div

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,670
turns out a lot of bit involved this

00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:02,740
particular trick so you know how I said

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,389
that the before and after a pseudo

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,699
element gave you two more elements to

00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:09,249
play with box shadow actually gives you

00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:13,509
I don't know unlimited more someone

00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:16,360
please correct me on this but the the

00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:18,459
limit the limitation here is that it can

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,309
only be one shape because I mean it's

00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:23,649
the shadow of something but the syntax

00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:25,929
is as follows and what you can do is you

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:28,389
can use the offsets which are the first

00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:33,819
two values for positioning and the blur

00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:36,339
radius for sizing so for the album's

00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:42,629
there are 11 dots so it looks like that

00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:47,290
11.11 box shadows so that's that okay

00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:48,910
this one is purely grata to us because

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,769
my original code pen demo just had

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,410
everything aligned right smack down the

00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:55,449
middle using flexbox but then I came

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:58,059
across an article by none other than

00:14:55,449 --> 00:15:00,040
Sarah Dresner talking about CSS scroll

00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:01,389
snapped I like why not I just you can

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,629
just throw this in it seems like a

00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:06,339
perfect East case for this so CSS scroll

00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:08,589
snap was actually introduced in for

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:10,629
scroll positions so users don't land at

00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:13,019
awkward scroll positions that leave a

00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:16,990
page partially on screen when panning

00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:18,639
okay fine it's scroll jacking but I can

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,410
understand the reason for this use case

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,629
and it actually works kind of kind of

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,089
well with the keyboard but the

00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:27,459
specification is unstable yet and it

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:30,549
only works on Firefox and surprisingly

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:35,280
Microsoft edge but then it doesn't

00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:37,620
support clip path this is you know like

00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,200
but the key property here for CSS

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,680
scrolls net is the scroll snap type on

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,050
the container and the scroll snap

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,970
coordinate on the inner element so this

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,310
is the kind of thing that is really

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,070
makes a lot of sense if you play around

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:55,710
with the code yourself so I've also have

00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,540
a code pen demo one thing about this is

00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:00,390
that if you look at the existing

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:03,390
polyfills that are around online I found

00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:05,370
two but they both only support the older

00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,710
syntax so they don't work very well

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:12,480
CSS scroll snap only works natively on

00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:16,320
as I said Firefox and itch so the source

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,520
code and the code pen link is here one

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,350
thing to note about trying out the

00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,810
latest and greatest is to always check

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,320
with can I use com just to see how

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:28,410
browser support is but that being said

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,510
there's never been a better time to then

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,610
now to live on the cutting edge because

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,910
evergreen browsers are a thing now and

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,130
we don't have to wait six months for a

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:42,060
new feature

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:44,400
Safari so here's all the related reading

00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,460
in more or less the order that I talked

00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,930
about them really good stuff suggest

00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:54,710
that you go through this when you have

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:54,710
time and that's it for me

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,220
