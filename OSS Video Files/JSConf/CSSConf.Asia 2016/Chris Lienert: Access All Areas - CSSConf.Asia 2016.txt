Title: Chris Lienert: Access All Areas - CSSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-02
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	Accessibility is about ensuring that the products we build are able to be used by as wide an audience as possible. While the ARIA specification might be daunting, building accessible interface elements isnâ€™t as difficult as it may seem.
Chris will take you through his experience building a responsive UI library sharing the failures and successes along the way.
Chris started out as a web developer when Netscape ruled the world and is currently working as an engineering manager at CXA.
He founded community group Singapore CSS because someone had to. ;) Aside from musical distractions and accumulating frequent flyer points, Chris and his wife Sarah can be found in the company of their small human.

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,009
so I'd argue that accessibility is

00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:18,480
probably more important than saving

00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:20,739
people from fires and stuff sometimes I

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,930
wish I had a really good fake American

00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:26,590
accent just to really confuse people but

00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:29,259
I don't so they already covered it but

00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,890
this is not me I've not given up my

00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:36,760
acting career to become a developer the

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:40,149
money's not really the same this is me

00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,399
I'm not too sure I always get asked

00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:45,190
about the other guy took this photo for

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,249
me this was done in a car park somewhere

00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,289
in Perth doesn't look anything like that

00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:55,449
when you see the original photoshop is

00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:58,480
good through my talk I'll be referencing

00:00:55,449 --> 00:01:01,390
a couple different URLs to save you

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,330
typing stuff madly I put them all on my

00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,560
tumblr so if you want to play along with

00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,350
a couple of demos that I'll be going

00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,170
through like this down now and you can

00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,270
see exactly how bad my code is in my

00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:18,970
flesh rather than nice bits that i show

00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:20,980
you in my slides and i moved to

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,130
singapore a couple of years ago I was

00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:27,130
working for this company I just left

00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:31,500
them one of the things I did when I

00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:36,370
shifted here is I took on the task of

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:39,060
creating a global you I standard the

00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,290
company I was working for jlt operate in

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,150
140 something countries around the world

00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:47,800
we had teams just anywhere we didn't

00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,510
even know how many teams that were

00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,320
working on software for us at any given

00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,090
time and there was no coherence anything

00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,640
from one to another we had a logo that

00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:01,540
was the same most of the time the colors

00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,940
weren't any sense of you I was just lost

00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,530
and branding was lost between the

00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,739
different divisions and outsourced

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,769
companies and everything so stupidly I

00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:14,980
decided to do this myself I had no

00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:15,500
actual support really I don't recommend

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,750
doing

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,910
get help I should note actually before I

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,920
go further I don't work at the company

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,050
anymore I don't know if anyone's

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,240
actually maintaining this project all

00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,490
the code is on github so you can grab it

00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,990
and look at it how if you like but no

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:38,540
guarantees about how long it's going to

00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:40,580
be there and I set out following the

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,280
programmers credo we do things because

00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,720
we think they are easy not because we

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,190
they're easy because we thought they'll

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,440
going to be easy and classic avoidance

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,970
behavior the first thing I did setting

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,310
out to create a UI style guide was to

00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:02,780
look into architecture because that's

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:05,900
exactly where you go this piece of

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,320
architecture is called the Strand this

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:14,959
was designed by Arthur Ericsson and it's

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:18,380
in robson square in vancouver erickson

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,720
followed the design philosophies of the

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,209
universal design and the idea of

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,910
universal design is that you build

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,730
something and it's just inherently able

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:31,519
to be used by everyone so you've got a

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,310
set of stairs where's the ramp well the

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,230
ramp is in the stairs that's just how

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,870
you do a ramp and how you do stairs

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,880
there's nothing no special accordance

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:45,530
made for anyone here this is just good

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:49,400
design and the ideas of universal design

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:51,880
are to make things equitable so

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,350
regardless of individual abilities

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:59,470
something will just work you don't have

00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:03,380
to have legs in order to get up the ramp

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,630
needs to be flexible so irrespective of

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,440
how someone wants to use it it'll just

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:11,120
work William Gibson has a saying on this

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,790
like the street finds its own use for

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,400
things when we design a product that's

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,810
good anyone can pick it up and just use

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,810
it the way they want to they don't have

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,150
to read a manual it should just work in

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,070
a way that makes sense this is very

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,380
difficult of course but this is what we

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,140
aim towards

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:34,040
design should be simple and intuitive

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:38,600
they should make sense without anyone

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,310
having to explain what goes on this is

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,680
one of those things that's really easy

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,720
to discuss but it's really hard to do in

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,930
practice because what makes sense to

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,400
people changes over time my son is five

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,520
years old if I give him a touch

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,800
interface he's got no problem with it if

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,450
I give a touch interface to someone I

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,550
mean first iPhone ship with a manual

00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,740
because Apple weren't sure that people

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,450
would know what to do with the thing now

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,050
we think is touch and we talk about is a

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,660
really intuitive way of doing UI design

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,820
but there's nothing really in inherently

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,150
intuitive about anything it we just have

00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:18,740
to get into the social understanding of

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:20,930
how people do things so expectations

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,840
will change over time in essence so

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,760
what's simple intuitive to us now wasn't

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,350
for someone 100 years ago for example

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,350
and won't be for some 100 years from now

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:37,130
design should be perceptible if you

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:39,770
can't see it it's not there humans

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,510
develop object permanence around eight

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,310
months with young babies you can do

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,410
peekaboo that's really exciting because

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:49,460
you've disappeared when your hands are

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:51,860
in front of your eyes like wow with

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,960
interfaces it's exactly the same thing

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,060
if you can't see it if you've got a

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,640
something that shows up only on hover

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,620
it's not there so I might find it by

00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,260
accident but if thats content that

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,200
someone needs to actually consume then

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,240
it's not going to be read this is one of

00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,670
the big arguments against carousels for

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,500
example and because the rates for

00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,900
carousels no one basically gets past the

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,790
first slide that I don't read it so when

00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,890
someone insists on a carousel we say are

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,720
you happy that ninety-eight percent of

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,850
your viewers won't see anything past the

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,750
first thing if they are that's fine let

00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:30,290
them pay the penalty design should be

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:32,810
tolerant and I've done a lot of work on

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:35,330
forms in the past and when you see

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,770
videos of testing with forms and you see

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,520
people crying because they get an error

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:43,250
message you understand the impact of

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:48,800
you doing to people let people make

00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:53,389
mistakes let them fail in a way that's

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,699
gentle don't let them just fall and cry

00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,229
because that's what happens it's one of

00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,699
the problems in our industries is we

00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:01,370
never really see the people at the other

00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:02,810
end of the screen but keep that in your

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,550
mind when you're doing it someone's

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,199
going to have a great deal of difficulty

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:11,449
with this unless I think about it a bit

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:17,210
better design should be low effort you

00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:19,699
shouldn't have to like do gymnastics on

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,940
the keyboard to do a keyboard shortcut

00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:24,680
if you any Photoshop users with the the

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,380
export command it's absolutely

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,150
disgusting and the guy who came up with

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,400
it thought no one was going to use it so

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,319
he you have to like use a couple of

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,199
hands and I think your nose just to get

00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,599
the the key commands right he's written

00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,240
a blog post apologizing sense that you

00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:45,199
know if they thought about a bit better

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:48,050
it might have been nicer the sign needs

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,400
to be appropriate for the size and space

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:55,639
regarded in dividual abilities having a

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,830
five-year-old and a boy I'm acutely

00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,659
aware of how well-designed urinals are

00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,580
in toilets because you go into them you

00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,349
get the ones that are really tall and he

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,969
can walk in there there's no problem you

00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,270
get the ones where the height is up here

00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:10,039
I have to hold him so we can go later

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,080
just a simple design of having it work

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,060
for everyone adults can walk in they use

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,630
it doesn't make a difference little boys

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,900
can walk in and it's fine when you don't

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:24,710
use Universal Design then you notice

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,539
basically on a similar note I wasn't

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:30,279
really as appreciative as I could have

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:33,260
been until I had a a pram or stroller

00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,000
and when you've got wheels and you need

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,099
to navigate through something then you

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,899
really appreciate how good ramps are and

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,370
lists and things like that otherwise

00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:42,050
you'll just walk through life and not

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:46,310
really notice that much until you hurt

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:50,180
your foot or something to setting out to

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:53,120
build a framework this tells you a lot

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,130
about my own personality but I went with

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,260
no dependents

00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:00,550
I didn't want any history any baggage

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:06,280
anything to hold me back my rationale

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:07,690
behind that is that I don't want to like

00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,730
fail because someone else has written

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,740
something bad that's going to break and

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,140
I don't know what it does I won't have

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,210
some idea of what's actually going on so

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,280
the way to do that is pretty simple you

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:22,570
take bootstrap jquery all your different

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:25,030
libraries and throw them in the bin I've

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:28,750
got so many people who use bootstrap and

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:31,920
they hate it really it's taking my

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,120
opportunity again to bag bootstrap

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,160
there's nothing really in there that you

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,640
can't do yourself you just have to

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,220
really have a go the scariest thing out

00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,260
of this was throwing out jquery I mean

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,990
I've been writing JavaScript since it

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:53,530
was released in 96-97 whenever it was I

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:57,250
became a fully fledged jquery friend or

00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:59,590
something along those lines and you

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,450
don't need it anymore you've got element

00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,670
query selector and query select all

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,920
that's most of what jQuery does for you

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,360
you can live without it let go of the

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,340
tethers and your life will be much

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,920
happier the first thing setting out to

00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,080
create a library and following universal

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,480
design was to make sure accessibility it

00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:23,140
was a key that meant diving into the

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,150
Aria roles I thought this was going to

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,520
be a lot harder than it was I had a

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:30,310
pretty good idea of how Aria things work

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,990
because I care about that anyway but

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,450
creating this library I wanted to make

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,530
every single component of it completely

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,610
accessible no excuses every line of code

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,230
everything that's rendered must be

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:45,880
accessible to everyone to the fullest

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:49,630
possible standard so it meant reading a

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,280
lot of documentation there were the good

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,150
things out of this is it's changed how I

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:59,110
code so instead of I've got my bem

00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:01,600
syntax here where I've got a tab and

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,120
I've got my selected state when you use

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,040
the Aria components you don't need

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,840
anything else it actually gives you the

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,420
syntax that makes a whole lot more sense

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,800
in there and it's easy to understand

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,780
someone else's code when you're eating

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,790
this you can see right away Aria

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,800
selected is true you know what the state

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,590
of that component is it gives you a

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,410
JavaScript selector it gives you obsess

00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:25,720
s if you need to do anything with

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,140
JavaScript it does all the work for you

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,580
this is pretty awesome and most of these

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,970
things have just been sitting there and

00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,470
get ignored a bit but Aria pays off

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,630
really quickly even if you don't care

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,790
about accessibility just by following

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:43,680
the standards you get all these freebies

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:46,920
which is really nice and then again with

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,360
setting attributes through JavaScript

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,250
it's really clear what this code does

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,810
you don't really need to explain to

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,990
anyone what you doing you don't have a

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,910
half a custom class or anything thats

00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,920
all i needs to understand how your CSS

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:05,260
works to work out how to set of selected

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:07,900
state or some other state when i first

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:11,190
got into this i got a bit crazy and did

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,590
things like this and don't do that

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,640
there's already hidden display none

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,440
slightly yeah if it's hidden I don't

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,180
want to show it on the screen right but

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,430
then you want to animate something and

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,630
it's display none so you can't do that

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:28,630
anymore so I quickly learnt to use like

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,070
name spacing in essence where you just

00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,040
attach it to a class that's already

00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:35,380
there then you've got the flexibility to

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,670
do things how you want I saw recently

00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:43,800
Hayden Pickering suggested one of the

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:47,530
other area pseudo classes or selectors

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,560
you do in a universal so ignored what

00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,940
I'm telling you in that regard that

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,740
generally speaking just be careful when

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,740
you when you're getting into this stuff

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:03,070
the first thing you'll want to do is

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,340
really dive into the documentation and

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:09,160
if you've looked at w3c documentation

00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,920
it's pretty scary I mean look how

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:16,350
attractive this this design is really

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,350
once you make it once you've read it

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:27,040
fortunately I'm not the first person to

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,720
ever have done this so i mentioned

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,260
Hayden Pickering before he's got some

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,640
really awesome examples of UI components

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,080
you can just grab them exactly as they

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,660
are and pop them into your projects if

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,170
you like otherwise read his code work

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,330
out how it operates and its really good

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,810
w3c documentation does have examples

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,550
some of them a bit wrong which is why

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,070
it's a good idea to go a bit further and

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,050
find what you're doing and the thing

00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:56,800
that you need to do is you know you need

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:59,470
tabs in a site so just Google Aria tabs

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,930
and get your examples from that it's not

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,790
hard just add Aria to your google search

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,340
and your life will be a whole lot easier

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:12,280
and everyone using your product will be

00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:17,260
happier as well leah is right here this

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:20,860
is her work Thank You Leah I needed to

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:23,470
create a hierarchical picker we had some

00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,210
really complex data and we needed a way

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,700
for people to select things we had

00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:32,200
basically really deep nested business

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:34,600
units parent company local region office

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,000
office locations in a city it was just

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,160
crazy crazy trying to work it out and

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,540
the you is that was there before I got

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,000
onto the project with pretty horrendous

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,100
there are about five steps for anyone to

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,960
get through to select something so I

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,960
grabbed awesome fleet which is as

00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,550
awesome as the name suggests I mean it's

00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:58,330
2k and you've got a fully accessible by

00:14:53,550 --> 00:15:02,920
use this thing everyone you don't need

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:07,780
bootstrap when you've got this it's this

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:09,760
is my code I was going to do a live demo

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,890
but for some reason keynote hates me at

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:17,350
the moment so I'm just doing this live

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:19,210
version instead this is a hierarchical

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,790
picker that when you start typing it

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:24,190
will select things for you this

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,800
structure is taking a tree view from the

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,170
REO recommendations so all the

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,720
accessibility of a treeview nested in

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:35,649
with the recommendations of how a

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,569
auto complete works so when you have

00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:39,699
custom controls you don't have to just

00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:43,420
say well it's not in the Aria spectrum

00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:45,550
who needs accessibility just chop and

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,620
change what's in there and it makes

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:51,009
sense after a while it's not too hard to

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,600
wrap your head around it so the idea of

00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:56,079
this one is you can very quickly select

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,269
what you want and then navigate down the

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,949
tree without having to know what it's

00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:01,480
doing if you don't want to type you can

00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:04,990
still navigate through the tree because

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,689
it's a fully accessible tree view so you

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,439
get both things at once which is great

00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:12,610
this is a demo so it doesn't look pretty

00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:14,110
never went to production because I left

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,790
the company before anything happen with

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:23,019
it but the code is there is this thing

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:27,310
does work you can't read that I can't

00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:29,290
read that that's getting this is a huge

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:33,100
screen so my examples a little bit lost

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:35,379
but you meant to write it by now one of

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,980
the keys like Aria roles are any part of

00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:42,160
accessibility making things obvious is

00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,899
really important accessibility we talk

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,360
about usually in a very narrow range

00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:49,180
where we say that here's the area stuff

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,279
you you follow the add the attributes

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,769
and you're done but it's not just that

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,860
and this is really going back to

00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:57,879
universal design making things

00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,509
intuitive's that you can actually work

00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:03,879
out what you're doing so the universal

00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:06,220
design principles here are simple and

00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:08,709
intuitive perceptible low-effort rise

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:15,069
right size and space and that's wrapped

00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:20,350
uppers make it obvious this is Google's

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:21,720
recommendation for touch sizing and this

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,890
is really what you need to know about

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,480
buttons and interactive elements

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,850
basically you need to make them big

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,159
enough before touchscreens became a

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,080
thing usually we were worried about

00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:34,600
something that you could generally reach

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,470
with a mouse with touch we've got these

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,500
things which are really clumsy at you I

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:44,230
interaction and the research has been

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,070
done that we know that based on a

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,350
certain pixel

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,420
you can make something big enough that I

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,510
can tap it with my finger without having

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,550
to be worried about it people use this

00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,900
in dark patterns or I don't know if

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,720
they're actually intentionally being

00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,550
evil or if they're just ignorant but

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,440
you'll see pop-up ads on mobile where

00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:05,130
it's got a tiny little X and it makes

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,630
you actually click on the add instead

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:12,040
but if you love your users and you do

00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:14,530
because you're here at CSS conf Apple

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,430
and Google recommend a minimum 24 pixels

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:21,190
for an interaction target so 24 by 24

00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:24,090
microsoft recommends 26 pick one go with

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,590
it and at least things will be better

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,410
when you're getting into really tight

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,880
you eyes and even but I'm desktop this

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,150
makes things easier if you're using a

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,960
mouse it's easier to click on the thing

00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,470
regardless of how you're interacting

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,630
with your device making elements or

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:48,160
interactive elements larger makes them

00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:49,450
better color contrasts usually see as an

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,930
issue Harrow plate when you get your

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:54,310
eyes tested when you're younger or

00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:58,570
something that you might encounter color

00:18:54,310 --> 00:19:01,180
blindness and the whole point of initial

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,890
haro plate is some colors don't really

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:08,410
gel very well with each other and

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:10,420
contrast don't work very well really the

00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:13,150
cure load when you read into how color

00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,460
blindness affects people the way to fix

00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:18,600
it is to ensure that the elements have

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,620
enough contrast from each other so that

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,870
irrespective of being able to perceive

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,760
the colors you can still tell the

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,490
difference so anyone who's colorblind

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,560
along the wrong spectrum or right

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,630
spectrum will have trouble reading this

00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,700
this is hard to read anyway even if you

00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:37,020
do have perfect color vision because the

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,610
contrast is intentionally difficult

00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:43,990
fortunately getting the w3c have done

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:46,720
the work for us they recommend contrast

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,730
ratios for 21 or four and a half to one

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,730
for small text at less than 20 points

00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:55,390
and three two one for anything from 20

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:57,010
and up so that's great you know what to

00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,870
do the problem is how to actually test

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,120
for it

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,860
the good thing is there are some really

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,580
good browser plug-ins this is the one in

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:09,690
Firefox this is the WCAG contrast

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,070
checker I have it alt see I hit and it

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,250
just comes up and you can test things

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:17,280
really quickly fortunately the w3c site

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:19,230
passes the contrast checker partly

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,190
because they're designers so bland that

00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:25,950
you know here hope it does you can see

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:28,200
up here that the the contrast ratio is

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,830
there the luminosity so it shows you

00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,330
exactly what passes and what fails it

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,400
gets a bit more complex when you're

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:39,530
dealing with background images and most

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:42,030
checkers don't do this very well because

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,530
when you have a variable background do

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,670
you need to basically measure every part

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:49,380
of it this site actually let's that lets

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,030
he do it so you can put an image in

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,190
there you can put the text on top and

00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:56,190
I'll tell you whether or not it is going

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,900
to pass or not the difficult thing is

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,750
when you're first starting out doing

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,970
color contrast properly is getting into

00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,350
the rhythm of it because designers don't

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,350
have very good tools for actually

00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:09,660
measuring contrast so what you really

00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,030
need to do is talk to your designers

00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,850
frequently when they give you something

00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:16,320
test it out and see and talk to them and

00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,140
show you them and work out what the

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,059
answer is going to be once you get used

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,850
to how contrasts work you'll be able to

00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:25,920
see what is a good contrast or not

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,440
without having to do a test I mean you

00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,059
still test anyway to confirm but when

00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,190
you get into the habit of it and becomes

00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:34,050
much easier it's certainly difficult at

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:39,300
first and especially so for designers

00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:41,960
because the tools are just lacking but

00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:45,000
color contrast is more complex than that

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:50,280
this is a blog posts from Ryan Fredrik

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,640
at Shopify and they started looking at

00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,190
the ratios and they're fixed ratios and

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,990
humans are not robots where organic

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,720
creatures we see the green spectrum

00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,420
particularly well we perceive other

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,240
colors better or worse according to what

00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,390
we're designed to do in nature and that

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,490
means you get things like this where

00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,770
we've got a failure over on the left

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,200
and a success over on the right yet

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:18,450
perceptively the one on the left is

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:23,010
probably a little that's your right

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:26,100
anyway the white text is somewhat better

00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,990
to read in certain circumstances so the

00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,240
algorithm itself is not quite enough

00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:35,580
like the simplicity of what the w3c are

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,410
doing isn't necessarily perfect and the

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:41,250
Shopify team looked into this further

00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:44,070
and they found a 1992 highway manual

00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:46,380
talking about the legibility of signage

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,840
and they've done the research there are

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:52,740
there's maths I'm sorry to introduce

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:55,559
maths in the morning but this actually

00:22:52,740 --> 00:23:00,630
shows that the white on red is more

00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:04,320
perceptible for for human interaction

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:06,540
basically than the black on red even

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,760
though it's the other way around when

00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:11,130
you use a simple formula so if you're

00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,720
getting into this and you're really sure

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:17,360
that your color looks good even though

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,559
the w3c tool tells you otherwise then

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,880
dive a bit deeper and you can come up

00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,880
with some really interesting designs

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:35,309
buttons annoy me greatly when iOS 7 came

00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,840
around everything went flat and flat

00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:40,400
meant that we don't know what we're

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,960
clicking on on interacting with any more

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,809
google followed suit with material if

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,330
you use later and we've got our three

00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:50,970
buttons that this one's all right middle

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:53,400
one you can see it's button e the one on

00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:56,850
the end what is that like is that just

00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,380
text on the screen how I meant to know

00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,970
whether I meant to interact with that or

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,740
not I'm just going to leave that alone

00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:04,230
and not touch it because it might do

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:09,030
something bad this is a really really

00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:10,650
bad trend and we frequently follow like

00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,300
humans of pack animals we follow

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,860
everyone else's example of what to do

00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,420
Google write something Apple write

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,830
something we just do exactly what they

00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:21,600
do without question but this is not good

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:24,390
because there's nothing inviting about

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,020
that button there's nothing to tell me

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,650
to make it

00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,910
obvious you can get context within

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:33,090
positioning on the screen and certain

00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:36,230
habits will form but there's nothing

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:38,460
inherently button II about it

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,260
fortunately with a lot of open source

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,350
style guides lately we've got some

00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,390
really good examples of what to do the

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,220
really basic level is you need some

00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,680
outline around the target so I know how

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,720
big the thing is am I going to tap over

00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,460
here or there or where when you've got a

00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,400
border you know exactly what you're in

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,100
for it makes it much easier to interact

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,160
with something this is from the US

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,890
government web design standards I

00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:08,040
haven't looked at the site since Trump

00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:11,760
was passed it's probably all in flames

00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,380
at the moment I don't know there are

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,640
lots of good examples of what to do with

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:19,860
buttons out there keyboard access this

00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:24,290
is something that gets neglected quite a

00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,290
lot because it requires some effort

00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,650
fortunately the efforts not that much

00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,110
usually for keyboard access of UI

00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,720
controls you need tab enter an arrow

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,340
keys or space as well you don't really

00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,900
need to do all that much and once you've

00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,240
written it for one control you can

00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,220
coffee those patterns and might using a

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,760
library and reuse it everywhere else as

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,830
well fortunately we live in a world

00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:51,900
where run shares everything Remy chef

00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:54,510
has done the work for you I thought tabs

00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:58,560
how hard can tabs be tabs can be very

00:25:54,510 --> 00:26:00,930
hard so Remi wrote this article how tab

00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,970
should work when I look through it it

00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:06,150
didn't quite do everything that I wanted

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:08,700
to so grabbed his code and modified it

00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:11,250
I've got a blog post that says how tab

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:15,360
should really work but I'm not Remy

00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:17,160
sharp so you haven't read it before this

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,320
is my code example of the tabs that I

00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:23,250
wrote again this is demos here we're at

00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:27,270
CSS conferred most CSS is minimal really

00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:30,030
bad I basically done enough to show how

00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:32,700
things are interoperable here and no

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:36,000
further than that so this is when the

00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,130
page first loads sometimes you'll see

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,360
can't handle multiple sets of tabs on

00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,430
the

00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,460
green or so come on learn how to use

00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:47,870
javascript properly so here I've

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:50,810
selected the second tab I've now got

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:52,640
focus on the second tab my contrast is

00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:55,370
really bad I'm sorry so you probably

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,110
can't see that very well and this is

00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,800
where the keyboard now basically kicks

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:04,490
in and then I can use arrow keys and

00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:08,090
there to navigate between tabs which is

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:11,120
really good so we'll pause and reflect

00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,080
with a kitten for a moment because up to

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,620
hear you've basically done everything

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,870
which is great but once you've reached

00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,390
this point you need to think that little

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:23,000
bit further which is to make sure you

00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:26,180
don't mess with the environment that

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,190
you're in when we're writing things at a

00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,440
custom if using a form control like I

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,870
select it's built into the browser the

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,510
behavior behaviors are non when you

00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:37,340
write something on your own then you

00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:39,620
need to bring it up to that standard or

00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:42,130
don't ship it and that means you need to

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,300
respect everything that the browser does

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,920
what you need to do is be able to go

00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,100
backward and forward in a browser

00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,530
without stings stuffing up I should be

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,620
able to hit a hash somewhere in the URL

00:27:51,530 --> 00:28:00,500
without it breaking angular or any

00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:02,330
javascript libraries angel is bad even

00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,970
react did this early on where if you

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,680
have at two hashes in the urologist it

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,720
kills the framework which it stops the

00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:13,310
rendering they've fixed it angular is

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,200
kind of catching up but anyway you need

00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,880
to be able to refresh the page and the

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,310
tab i selected last time is still

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,240
selected by it why can't these things

00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:26,120
just be done but it's not that hard most

00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,860
of how this works is but in this

00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,510
particular instance you can refresh it

00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,580
and a tab stays oh there's an API for

00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:33,170
that it's the storage API that's been

00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,230
there for a while no one really knows

00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:38,360
about it but it takes care of a lot of

00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:41,050
the problems that we usually have with

00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,030
remembering things filling out a form

00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,290
you get an error it reloads the page and

00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:48,470
everything you've filled out it's gone

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:50,030
because no one knows how to do this but

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,140
storage lets you do all of that on the

00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:55,250
client side without a pro

00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:57,610
it's really really powerful but the

00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:00,980
essence of it is to make sure you don't

00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:03,040
kill what sorry there you maintain the

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,110
standards of what things should do and

00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,730
it's not good enough to say that oh I

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,700
know everyone's going to have JavaScript

00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:12,560
turned on so you know it's all going to

00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,920
be fine all my users have got perfect

00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,120
vision I've asked them it's all right

00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,520
you need to actually think that little

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,790
bit further and it's really what

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,290
Universal Design is about is building

00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,940
things for everyone anyway because

00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:29,120
that's just the better way of doing

00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,740
things a lot of accessibility talks use

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,750
a lot of stick where they're just

00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,950
telling you a bad person if you don't do

00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,020
this thing I'm trying to give you a

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,750
carrot here to make you feel better

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,790
about just making your code better the

00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,070
fact it's accessible and people get to

00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:46,810
use it is a bonus it's just a better

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:51,800
quality product that you'll be producing

00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:54,590
and universal design has gone into other

00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,750
fields this is a whole range of

00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,970
prototype peelers and finished products

00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:02,240
that were the first product from ox 0

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:05,180
and Sam Farber founder noticed that his

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,030
wife feels quite athletic and had

00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:10,040
trouble using a kitchen peeler and it

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,540
was like well that's not good and he

00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,510
went to the shop and there was nothing

00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:17,030
he could find that did the job so he

00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:19,370
iterated through several designs and got

00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:22,460
her to test it out and this is designed

00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,590
only for his wife I've got oxide product

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,090
so I had no idea about this until I

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,370
actually looked into it I just thought

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,940
they were really well designed and

00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:34,630
that's the essence of what this is about

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:37,160
making your products fit into the

00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:39,470
philosophies of universal design will

00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:42,230
make a better products inherently even

00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:48,560
for people who don't have any special

00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:50,630
needs so go forth with your inspiration

00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:54,950
that you too can create a better kitchen

00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:59,330
pillar regardless of how strange your UI

00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:01,400
might be and your work will be a whole

00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,910
lot better thank you

00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:08,329
[Music]

00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,329
[Applause]

00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:14,030
all right I do thank you so much Chris

00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,550
that was an amazing talk on web

00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:21,230
accessibility so do any of you have any

00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:24,230
questions for Chris Zell will be giving

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:30,530
out the microphone has anyone want to

00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:32,540
know about kitchen peelers yeah the

00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:34,580
highway signs thing you had with the

00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,230
leave it on for a bit the contrast

00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,790
levels what were the numbers being used

00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,380
in that was it because you're using some

00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,030
color numbering system that I wasn't

00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,680
familiar with so maybe I can talk about

00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,480
after that but if you could share a bit

00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,760
more about it i'll be helpful yeah if

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,080
you it's on the Shopify article actually

00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:56,030
linked to that highway manual I can jump

00:31:51,080 --> 00:32:00,530
back in the slides no I can't jump back

00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:06,170
30 sides there we go I can't actually

00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:07,820
remember the intent behind this is the

00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:09,560
highway manuals quite detailed into

00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,820
reflection of services and different

00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,580
things like that that they take into

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,860
account but the whole point of this is

00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:22,730
not just as simple as a straightforward

00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:29,530
color contrast right thank you anyone

00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:34,090
has any more questions for Chris anyone

00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:37,040
what color should your kitchen tea lovie

00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,540
all right then thank you so much Chris

00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,460
okay can you please give another round

00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:43,819
of applause for Chris

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,819
[Applause]
