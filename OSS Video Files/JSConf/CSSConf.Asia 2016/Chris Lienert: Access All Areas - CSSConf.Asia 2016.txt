Title: Chris Lienert: Access All Areas - CSSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-02
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	Accessibility is about ensuring that the products we build are able to be used by as wide an audience as possible. While the ARIA specification might be daunting, building accessible interface elements isnâ€™t as difficult as it may seem.
Chris will take you through his experience building a responsive UI library sharing the failures and successes along the way.
Chris started out as a web developer when Netscape ruled the world and is currently working as an engineering manager at CXA.
He founded community group Singapore CSS because someone had to. ;) Aside from musical distractions and accumulating frequent flyer points, Chris and his wife Sarah can be found in the company of their small human.

CSSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 24 November 2016.
