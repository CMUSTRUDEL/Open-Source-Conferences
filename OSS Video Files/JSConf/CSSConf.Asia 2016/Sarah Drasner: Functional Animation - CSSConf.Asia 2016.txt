Title: Sarah Drasner: Functional Animation - CSSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-05
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	Animation is captivating. Our brains are trained to respond most intently to movement. For this reason, animation in a user experience is extremely important, and also very easy to overdo. Carefully considered animation can compose spatial maps to guide users. Animations can be responsive, resolution-independent, and make a site function intuitively.
In this session Sarah will cover a myriad of use cases, from both design and technical implementation standpoints.

Sarah is an award-winning Manager of UX Design and Engineering at Trulia (Zillow) and staff writer at CSS-Tricks.
She’s given a Frontend Masters workshop on Advanced SVG Animations, and is working for a book for O’Reilly on SVG Animations. 
For 15 years she worked as a web developer and designer and at points as a Scientific Illustrator, an Undergraduate Professor and has tutored a Byzantine Icon painter in Santorini.
Sarah loves SVG, informative animation, and welding together pieces of the DOM.

hi everyone as as mentioned my name is

00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:19,990
Sarah Dresner I'm if I apologize if I'm

00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,360
coughing a little bit I don't wear

00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:26,230
glasses but I'm very nerdy so I have

00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:29,680
asthma so if I COFF a little bit while

00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:32,259
I'm speaking that is why I am a

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,719
consultant this isn't a picture of me

00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:38,680
and my mom and also my relationship to

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,090
Authority I'm a consultant and I used to

00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,640
be a manager of UX design and

00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,370
engineering at trulia zillow group and

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,649
now I give talks and I work for

00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,379
companies all over the place and give

00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:54,879
workshops speaking about things like I'm

00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:57,460
going to speak about today so before we

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,690
get into any details about animation I

00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,090
think it's important that we start from

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,180
the beginning what happens when you

00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:06,100
visit a website every time you look at a

00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,439
picture or anytime you look at a website

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,899
at all your eye isn't looking directly

00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,929
at anything your eye is gonna constantly

00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:15,219
move around an event called saccade and

00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:16,899
the part of the reason why we do this

00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:18,849
and these are heat maps of where your

00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:20,740
eyes are looking part of the reason we

00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:24,490
do this is to create a spatial awareness

00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,740
of the site or of the thing that we're

00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,359
looking at you do this so that you can

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,759
kind of understand your surroundings

00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:34,479
biologically but it works the same way

00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,759
on a website so why is this important

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,950
like why are we talking about the way

00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,409
that our eyes look around and see these

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,719
things we already use this information

00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:46,060
all the time web sites all start to look

00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:48,459
the same because you get used to like

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,079
having the CTA on the right and having

00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:51,939
the big hero image and stuff so people

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,889
feel comfortable when they come to their

00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:56,649
site their know their way around they

00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:58,029
don't have to kind of grok all of the

00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:00,340
information that you're giving them at

00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:01,630
once they can kind of already know what

00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,749
they're supposed to be clicking and

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,819
hitting in order to engage buttons on a

00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:09,130
website and CTAs become the most

00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:11,319
powerful thing we tend to like make

00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,019
everything else grey or green or blue

00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,450
and then these like bright orange CTA so

00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:17,380
that our users know where to click

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,240
because when they're gay

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,490
gathering all of that spatial awareness

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,220
looking around the site they can say Oh

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,490
aha like that is the piece that I need

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,350
right there this is also why things like

00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,480
growth hacking happen and people are

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,730
like okay making the button purple like

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,320
it make it pop polka dot make it pulse

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,700
and like developers are like no so

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,530
that's why that kind of stuff happens

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,800
that's also why we have all these like

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,080
user testings to see what will work this

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,850
way or that way when you're scanning and

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,640
reading things what actually draws your

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,620
eye and because of this animation kind

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,410
of gets a bad rap because when you're

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,080
scanning an environment and something is

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,630
moving that is the most powerful thing

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,390
you are biologically programmed to

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:08,770
notice and take note of something that's

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:11,110
in motion if you do animation well it

00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,390
can be really really an informative

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,640
experience and guide your users in a

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,890
really important way but if you do

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,020
animation poorly then it could be

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,510
irritating and jostling for the user so

00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,670
in light of that let's talk about

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,670
animation in terms of how you can create

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,250
spatial awareness 'iz and be responsible

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,060
for your users and part of the way that

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,000
we're gonna do that is we're gonna

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,280
separate out to ideas and animation one

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,470
of them is invisible animation or ui/ux

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,270
animation and the other is immersive

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,470
animation so we're gonna speak about

00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,480
those two things totally differently

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,790
because they're they're in essence

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,350
totally different ideas when you're

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,270
talking about invisible animation the

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,520
whole purpose of it is so that the user

00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,959
is not thinking like oh I just had an

00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,540
animation happen what they're thinking

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,640
is what it like a cohesive experience I

00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,070
just had when you're doing an immersive

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,100
animation the whole point is to guide

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,230
the user through like an entire idea of

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,080
animation and we'll kind of dig into

00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,730
each one of these things in in a lot of

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,910
detail but let's start with invisible

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:15,490
animation what I mean by that so UX

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:19,000
animation and UX choreography kind of

00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:21,070
come together in this format so when

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,900
we're creating these mental maps a lot

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,060
of times when we're dealing with stuff

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,070
on a website the most challenging thing

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,500
that we have is state right that's

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,820
something that we work a lot with in

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,480
terms of like moving over

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,920
to react to manage state or like

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,440
understanding state as we manage it in

00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,450
the Dom or understanding how the things

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,740
change and shift and move as a user

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:47,740
engages with our site so when you're

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,840
when your users are working with your

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,160
site and they're totally getting into it

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,080
and they're having this like flow based

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,330
experience because everything is really

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,310
really groovy and then all of a sudden

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,350
you interrupt them with like a modal or

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,780
something that's kind of just jarring

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,650
and jostling and doesn't work for your

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,450
experience it can completely destroy

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,640
what you've built for them this you

00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,890
spent so much time creating these mental

00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,390
maps for them and spatial awareness for

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,610
them and then all of a sudden you break

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,530
it that's bad

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,870
so we're connecting to different states

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,480
like we are here so you know a very

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,850
small example of this would be like the

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,770
one on the left where things kind of

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,510
just jump into view and the one on the

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,490
right where you kind of get a sense of

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,040
where things are coming from and where

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:38,500
they're going in like where the spatial

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,360
awareness is there so Kathy Sierra has

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,760
this awesome book called badass making

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,810
users awesome and a good talk that's

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,370
associated with it

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,650
and in it she kind of talks about these

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,620
cognitive leaks that can develop as we

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,870
structure our UIs and new X's so if

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,660
we're looking at something like this you

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,430
know burners that you might have on your

00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,690
typical stovetop you have a bunch of

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,670
burners and then you have a bunch of

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,800
controls for the burners and you can see

00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,020
here like it always takes me a second

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,450
like wait which knob is for which thing

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,670
but if you just restructure it a little

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,310
bit you can see how those cognitive

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:14,950
leaks are reduced you all of a sudden

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,710
just by rearranging those things are

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,170
giving users much more of a key for how

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:23,380
they should be working with your site so

00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:25,630
I made this pen to kind of demonstrate

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,920
this idea so if I have this map marker

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:32,590
and I open it and then in that this

00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,890
contact form because actually I should

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:39,310
probably turn the brightness up sorry I

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:41,020
was on an airplane that contact form

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,210
becomes the title and then the email

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,160
gets out of the way and then when I hit

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,440
the submit button

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,220
those two things become the loader which

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,990
then in turn becomes the success well

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,300
the things go on in the background and

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,740
then I know what what happened and what

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,660
is where it's going and where it's

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,360
coming from now when I close that down

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,470
it becomes the Mack marker again and if

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,810
I said to you later

00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,230
where did it go where is the contact

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,010
form you would say oh it's in there

00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,840
there's no in there

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,910
they're all just divs they've just

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,880
absolutely positioned things and stuff

00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,860
all of that is just like CSS and stuff

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,570
like that but really what it does for

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,490
the user is it gives them a sense of

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,800
spatial awareness and what happened was

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,590
we went through three different screens

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,930
of cognitive and mental maps that you

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,210
would have had to create and instead of

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,980
making that again and again with like

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,290
successive modal's or successive

00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,970
dialogues we have it all one fluid

00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:42,360
experience it feels much better for the

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:43,710
user so it can happen in these small

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,630
ways too you don't have to do something

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,760
as big as that either this is a kind of

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:51,330
typical UX pattern right we've got like

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,610
you know simple like magnifying icon and

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,830
then when I click on it it becomes the

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,190
input and what's nice about this is when

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,870
I put it away it not only does it give

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,970
us that spatial awareness of like oh it

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,830
goes in there and make it feel a uniform

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,390
it also takes up a lot less space in our

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,790
interface right we don't have the entire

00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:11,100
giant like the magnifying glass the

00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,169
input the submit button all of those

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,120
things we can actually condense those

00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,930
things down and make a better experience

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,980
for the user

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,430
another thing that's important is

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,860
isolation so if I have like in that same

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,510
way if I'm like scanning my environment

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,610
and I'm trying to make create a mental

00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:32,010
map of a situation if I have to read a

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,080
lot of information at once it takes me a

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,690
lot of time it takes me if there's more

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,380
cognitive leaks in that idea so if I

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,210
like zoom in on one of these it all of a

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,030
sudden becomes much more easy to read

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,650
and for me to understand and like really

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:50,400
really process that information it's not

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:56,550
a lot more things at all to build that

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,870
in so I was thinking about this idea of

00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,790
revealing and

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,980
how much I hate modal's I just hate

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,420
modal's it's like a weird personal

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,510
vendetta thing but it's not actually

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,510
even super personal in that Google hates

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:12,330
them too and has started to dock you

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,220
points if you have timed interstitials

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,110
on mobile so if you are one of those

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,029
companies that waits a few seconds and

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,210
then Springs a modal on you when you

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:23,640
look at a site Google is now gonna take

00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,310
off SEO points so you should not do that

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,770
so I'm not the only one who has this

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,110
vendetta I I think that that is a really

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,330
jarring experience it breaks your

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,380
context you're like involved in

00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,170
something and without triggering

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,210
anything this thing pops up and I would

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,740
call that kind of like brute force UX

00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,650
you know you're like I want the user to

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,810
see this stick it in their face which is

00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,930
not you know the most intelligent way of

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:51,029
working with the web so this is me and

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:54,980
like a really detailed picture of me

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:57,720
very very highly proficient and drawing

00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,850
modal's suck but then this is also me

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,580
thinking about it later

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,500
well okay wait let's be fair it's maybe

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,510
not just them it's their typical UX

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,180
pattern I bet that there is a way of

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,220
investigating a modal that makes it make

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,290
more sense and makes it not break all of

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,540
these things that you set up for

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,810
yourself so rather than have it be x and

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,390
just like an attack you would have to

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,250
open it you would have you as the user

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:27,120
would have to engage in order to create

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,070
it but it comes from that button and

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,810
because it comes from that button I know

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,670
where it came from and I know where it's

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,990
going and it doesn't feel as jarring

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,300
anymore

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,950
sometimes I dismiss modal's right away

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,350
when they pop up even if I need that

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,200
information so in this way I can get it

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,610
again if I decide that I need it and I

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,089
know where it's coming from and I know

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:50,850
where to retrieve it so I was thinking

00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,950
about this this whole idea like the

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,380
whole idea of how we have to bake

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,240
animation into an experience and that

00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,400
animation can't just be slapped on on

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,310
top right like some of the examples that

00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,450
I just showed you particularly like that

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,180
contact form one I couldn't have just

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:08,550
added animation at the end and that's

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,500
the way that a lot of PM's and a lot of

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,340
companies kind of deal with animation

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,990
they're like okay

00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,270
let's just build the page and we'll slap

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,620
the animation on after but it really

00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,410
needs to be part of the core experience

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,050
otherwise for the user it feels like an

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,460
extra thing they're waiting for so I was

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,830
considering this as I was in Barcelona

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,170
this summer and I was on this trip and I

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,180
was on this trip exploring a city and I

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,190
wanted to build out a day of activities

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,710
so this is kind of like a normal use

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,830
case I love Lonely Planet and it has

00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,660
really good content but if I go here and

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,570
then there's like five steps to even get

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,040
to Barcelona and then there I came from

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,279
there I can scroll down and see the

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,230
sights but like okay so that's good I

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,450
have some content that like helps me

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,000
find something I'm gonna pick la Sagrada

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,620
família I hear that's pretty nice and I

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,710
look there and this is the map that they

00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,779
have is like the site and then one thing

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,820
that's a pub and then one thing that's

00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,860
like another Church but like what if I

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,410
want to get lunch and what if I want to

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,320
see another site you can't expand this

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,779
map at all or like engage with it

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,810
so then I go back and then all of a

00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,339
sudden the sites look different and and

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,780
then I scroll down to food and drink

00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,670
which also looks totally different I

00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,010
have to scan and create a new

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,780
environment but then at the very bottom

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,760
of the page there's this map section I'm

00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:29,070
like okay that's maybe that's better so

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,860
I have this sites but all it has those

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,480
sites so if I go to if I click on each

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,120
one it takes me to the page of la

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,210
Sagrada família takes me back this isn't

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,730
great I'd have to keep writing down

00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:45,240
where I'm going I need food all sorts of

00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:47,040
stuff so Google Maps kind of does

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,520
something that's similar but different

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,470
in its better right so we once I have la

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,360
Sagrada família like it won't suggest to

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,190
me to go to a lesser Cara familia but

00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,900
once I know I'm gonna go there I can

00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,760
click here and it says like search

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,530
nearby which is pretty great because I

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,970
can look for restaurants that are nearby

00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:08,850
that area that's getting closer cool but

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,040
then you know if I want to look for bars

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,260
or pubs I lose all the context of all of

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,450
the restaurants that I was just at so

00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,250
that's not so good and I can send it to

00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,940
my phone but then I'm sending each fun

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,620
off to my phone so I was kind of canned

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,550
they also have things like reviews but

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,760
their content

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,700
unlike long

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,830
planet is not so great so let's consider

00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,920
how animation can really help the user

00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:38,430
and here like let's empower the user so

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,430
I built this demo which hopefully loads

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,970
so if you type in love for the Sagrada

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,250
família you go to sites then you're

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,170
going in between the sites and you can

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,110
kind of go through them and then you can

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:55,330
pick one and then you can pick food and

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:58,600
you can go the food and I could keep

00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:01,420
going and pick more sites or I could

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,760
just pick the itinerary that I want and

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,340
send the whole thing to my phone that's

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,890
more what I want that's more what I need

00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:12,460
as a user and in this animation isn't

00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:14,770
like hi I'm animation look at me go in

00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,600
this animation is key and core to the

00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,190
experience but that's not the only thing

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,990
that's key in court of the experience

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,780
you're really thinking about the whole

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,540
thing from start to finish for the user

00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,430
and not just what features you have but

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,480
what they are looking for and what they

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:33,850
want to make so like we can just empower

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,580
them in this way and that's a really

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:39,070
really awesome thing that we can do so a

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,810
piece of tough love here for everybody

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,670
who works on the web because I hear a

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,570
lot of hate for animation

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,700
do you hate animation if animation feels

00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,220
like the sugar on top that might be

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,110
because you treated it that way so like

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,180
if you are one of those companies who

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,500
said okay let's wait until we have the

00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,080
whole thing built and then we're gonna

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,020
put some animation on on top that is an

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,580
additive experience that is not core to

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,440
the experience that you're giving your

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,720
users that's something that you're doing

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,460
just to delight yourself which you know

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,040
delight is great but it's not

00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,060
informative and animation can be

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:18,250
informative which is some of its power

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,840
so things to keep in consideration when

00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,820
you're working with your own company's

00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,590
animation as you're like we'll take

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,300
these lessons and learn from them and

00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,610
want to engage and put them into your

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,980
site style and branding in animation is

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:32,650
just as important as style and branding

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,710
in like text or color and things that we

00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,180
kind of consider often for other kinds

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,780
of things like if we hadn't done this

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,190
with text already I'd be

00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,390
here talking about text if we hadn't

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,160
done it with color I'd be talking about

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,580
color but I think animation needs a hero

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,750
so we have these kind of like if you all

00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,450
over your site you have these like

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,280
linear eases you can have a conformation

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,290
that's like a bounce and then all of a

00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,820
sudden people on the your users are like

00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,380
oh that was a little bit different maybe

00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,480
I need to be paying attention to that I

00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,090
guess that was a success screen so you

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,640
can use animation and like different

00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:08,420
kinds of entrances and exits to really

00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,460
call meaning there's also like this

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,150
thing called react motion that's really

00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:16,760
awesome what it does is it allows you to

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:18,380
vana mayshen one of them and that that

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,810
we're gonna go into like more detail

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,000
about today it's going to be about

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,140
sequential based animation timed

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,210
animation that you're probably more

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,980
familiar with react motion is very

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,860
different it's like game based animation

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,260
it allows you to have physics and mass

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,030
and put that on the object and then you

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,670
send it on its way so it's interruptible

00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,510
it's good for things like chat heads and

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,160
things like that

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,350
so that you can like actually have the

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,390
user engage with it at that moment so

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,920
we'll talk a little bit about tools but

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,230
the way that these things are moving

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,110
around is nine-tenths of the law

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,880
if they were just scooting over that

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,580
wouldn't be the same experience at all

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,800
but but because I'm playing around with

00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,960
the way that those easing --zz work with

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,210
the way that those Springs work that

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,490
makes the whole animation experience

00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:10,010
feel different and that's part of your

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:11,330
branding as well so if we're looking at

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,040
these two balls everybody has to do a

00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,080
bouncy ball demo like if you are an

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,610
animator like you're just like you sit

00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,750
down and then somebody comes into the

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,760
room and they say it's time for the

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,590
bouncy ball demo and then you have to

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,280
write it so this is my bouncy ball demo

00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:28,460
the one one of these balls feels a

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,100
little bit more rigid and feels a little

00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,690
bit harder and the other ball feels a

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,670
little bit more fluid and it's subtle

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,860
right it's not like over-the-top or

00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,770
anything but these have the exact same

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,420
timings and the exact same heights and

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,890
they don't even feel like it they feel

00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,060
like they have different timings they

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,320
feel like they have different structures

00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,330
they feel like they're going to

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,490
different heights because of the way

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:53,360
that they're animating and so that

00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:55,580
becomes really really important

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,320
a one last thing to say about style and

00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,510
branding if you are the kind of person

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,190
who has a site like fidelity insurance

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,050
where you have like a bunch of money and

00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,730
you're dealing with somebody's cash you

00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,640
might want to be dealing with like more

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:11,030
responsible linear eases and like maybe

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,530
the hardball is like your ball but if

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,240
you're something like MailChimp that has

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,370
branding that's really playful and

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,810
engaging and exciting you might want to

00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,460
step away from that and make something

00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,650
that's a little bit more bouncy and a

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,910
little bit more fluid so all of the ways

00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:26,560
that you work with those so you'd have

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:29,930
the bouncy ball on the ride for sure

00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:32,080
so with these kind of anticipatory cues

00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:34,460
if I have this form here and I'm

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,460
actually let's open it up in its own

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:40,940
page so if I have this form here and I

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,260
write my email blah blah blah and a lot

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,120
of times what will happen is when you

00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,740
have a form and you submit something

00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,590
into a form you're giving your

00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,210
information to a website and that's kind

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,290
of a you know not so great experience

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,690
for the user

00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:56,270
you have to let them know that something

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,190
is going on while you're doing that like

00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,960
just having the submit button and then

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,120
letting them sit there and wait while

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,830
something happens - for a database in

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,080
the background is kind of harrowing for

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:09,590
them so if I hit this contact button and

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,180
it becomes a loader it you know feels a

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,670
little bit more fluid and that actually

00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,220
took some time but I didn't feel that

00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:19,220
time passing as well as much and I'm not

00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:23,030
sitting there like United Airlines did

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:25,700
you take my money or not I don't know I

00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:28,040
also like let them know with a big

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,690
bright green success screen that

00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,090
something good happened here that's

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,830
great you are okay why don't you go

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,060
somewhere else in our site now so I'm

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,920
thinking about that whole fluid

00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,960
experience going to another thing you

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,520
don't need to make it so big or anything

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,560
but just letting them know that

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,320
something good happened you want them to

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,420
feel good things like dopamine when

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,860
they're on your site you want them to

00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,490
feel successful when they're on your

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,960
site so this is part of perceived

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,900
performance you might have heard of

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,800
perceived performance - this is like a

00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,630
really big strength of animation so

00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,240
anticipate anticipatory queues these

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,690
custom loaders biet did an experiment

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,440
and

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:11,539
that when you use like an old-timey

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,179
loader that everybody's seen before

00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:17,179
people are not willing to wait as long

00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:20,299
if just that that we get logo with the

00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:22,700
tiny little dots that's not a crazy kind

00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:24,350
of animation that's not like a an insane

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,139
thing to implement but people were

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:29,539
willing to wait twice as long for that

00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:31,909
loader because you tell the customer

00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,460
hey we care about you we made something

00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:36,289
for you hold on a minute and that really

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,730
actually means a lot to the user with

00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:41,419
all of these experiments that we're

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:44,149
doing another thing that's kind of nice

00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:46,129
is if you have these perceived

00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:47,600
performances that aren't just like out

00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:49,549
of the box if you do something that's a

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,649
little bit more unusual it captures

00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,570
their attention and that also doesn't

00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:55,220
feel as long that doesn't make you feel

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,919
like you're waiting forever and it's an

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,379
amazing amazing how a few seconds it

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,710
takes a user to feel like you ditched

00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:06,919
them so so even just thinking about a

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,850
small animation like this that really

00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:09,649
doesn't take you like if you're using

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,509
something like gzip which we'll talk

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:13,940
about in a second this is one line of

00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:15,679
code that can actually really change the

00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,490
way that your user is feeling about the

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,679
way that you feel about them so one of

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,259
the big takeaways here spatial awareness

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,059
is important we're trying not to break

00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:28,940
spatial awareness because we don't want

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:33,889
to let our users down and you know don't

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:36,590
draw people and stuff so you know and

00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:38,629
like when we're creating and using these

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,210
kind of spatial awareness techniques we

00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:42,740
can go from simple like we were talking

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,379
about here to more complex this was a

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:48,289
code drops demo so if you want to select

00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:51,350
your seats at this theater you can see

00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:54,080
how just with like a little bit of

00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:57,259
animation you're actually letting you're

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,000
telling the user so much more about what

00:21:57,259 --> 00:22:01,129
this experience is gonna feel like for

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,590
them when they're in the theater and how

00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:06,409
that's going to be for them and it's a

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:09,080
much much more engaging experience than

00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:11,269
them just selecting their seats we can

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,549
also do something simple and small like

00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:16,639
these drag and drop in interactions so

00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:18,619
if I've got like these kind of things

00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:19,590
where I've got to like hold a piece of

00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:22,470
information for the

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:25,380
again if I asked somebody where did that

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:27,660
go you would say it went down there if

00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,780
there's no down there it's a absolutely

00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,970
position div but like knowing that they

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,860
know where to get it and they know where

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,570
it went is really helpful for them they

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:42,180
didn't have to break any kind of spatial

00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:43,620
awareness for that so we can't really

00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,910
talk about animation without talking

00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,190
about performance performance is really

00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,350
important because when things look janky

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,760
and things like stutter across the

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,070
screen even if you have the most

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,930
beautiful animation in the world people

00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,940
are going to not feel so great about it

00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,220
so one thing that's really important is

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,500
that you're using opacity and transforms

00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,930
wherever possible you can do crazy

00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,850
amazing stuff with just opacities and

00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,430
transforms it's amazing what you can

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,050
accomplish so I know it sounds like two

00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,240
properties that doesn't sound like much

00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,280
but you can actually accomplish a ton of

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,470
things you should also be thinking about

00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,360
hardware acceleration things like this

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,460
translate see hack you can even make a

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,610
mixin for it that you can apply or an

00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,960
extend where you can apply it all over

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,930
the code base so you don't sorry write

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,390
it all of the time so let's take a look

00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,640
at what that would look like so for this

00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:35,880
pen we've got like a hardware

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,300
accelerated div moving across and a

00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,280
control so this is the the like margin

00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,570
I'm moving things with margins for this

00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,670
one and I'm moving things with

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,650
transforms for this one I'm not sure if

00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,930
you can see from that screen but on my

00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:51,510
screen the top one is flickering and

00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,580
kind of moving across in a really janky

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:57,390
way well the bottom one is moving very

00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:59,790
very beautifully across now also if you

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:02,130
look in chrome dev tools and I say

00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:05,190
something like alright let's go to more

00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:07,980
tools and we're gonna go to rendering

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,590
I'm gonna pull this up and I'm gonna say

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,510
paint flashing when you when you use

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,580
paint flashing in the chrome dev tools

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,500
what's gonna be highlighted in that

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,170
green is anything that you're moving

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,600
around whether it's causing repaints so

00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,460
you can immediately see anything that's

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,040
on your screen that you're not really

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,630
dealing with correctly so that's a

00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,700
really nice visual cue if you're doing

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:32,220
an audit of a bunch of animations at

00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,550
once saying okay we need help here and

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,710
we need

00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:39,120
help here and we need help here in case

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,670
you were wondering if it's just me who

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,290
thinks this Netflix also employs all of

00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:44,700
these things you can read a case study

00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,560
about that

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,420
yeah they work with opacity and

00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,370
transforms in order to animate some of

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:54,960
the very simple hover effects that they

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:56,970
have on their movies so all of that said

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,910
we kind of went into all of these like

00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:01,980
how to really subtly deal with you know

00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,170
your spatial awareness and your users

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,060
and getting them from here to there now

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,550
let's kind of break and talk about

00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,250
something else and it's similar but

00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:13,170
different in its immersive animation so

00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,870
immersive animation would be a little

00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:18,000
bit closer to like if you have a diagram

00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:20,310
that you're trying to like show

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,740
something to the user explain a concept

00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,780
you're not trying to hide the animation

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,700
from them that whole experience is

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,500
supposed to be an animation or like if

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,510
you think about like the big movie sites

00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,570
where they're like the whole idea is

00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:37,140
just like go watch Life of Pi and here

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,640
are lions and tigers and things so

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,370
that's an immersive animation they're

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,680
not trying to like subtly do anything

00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,720
they're just like we're gonna wow you so

00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,070
this is a different type of animation

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,110
and a different we deal with it in a

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,480
different way the purpose is to call

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,430
attention and I there's lots of

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,200
different ways of working with them 3je

00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,940
yes and canvas and there's be our

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,890
experiences but today we're gonna focus

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,540
on SVG because I think it's a little bit

00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:04,560
closer to what we were dealing with

00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:06,930
before in that the typical you know web

00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,190
developer will probably be able to work

00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:11,370
with it and create something really

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,590
beautiful and it's got a lot of things

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:16,830
going for it one of them is that it's

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,900
got really great support SVG like has

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,790
kind of a bad reputation for not being

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,740
well supported I do consulting work with

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,970
a lot of different companies and one of

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,070
the first things they say to me is

00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,320
always like oh well but SVG isn't

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,630
supported but look at all that green I

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,670
think it kind of crept up on us we have

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,140
this like old idea that it has poor

00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,330
support but it doesn't anymore

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,370
so we should take advantage of that you

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,840
probably know these things already but

00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,790
I'm just going to go over them just

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,130
really quickly to talk about some of the

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:46,380
things I love about SVG it's crisp on

00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,390
every any display for anybody who's had

00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,250
do like image replacement for retina and

00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,800
things like that you don't have to slice

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:55,230
a million images the picture element is

00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,180
great but you still have to make all of

00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,800
these different images and cut them all

00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,420
up and you know make sure that they're

00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
all like working properly and your

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,570
polyfill is working properly you don't

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,700
have to do that with SVG you have one

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,800
graphic because of that there's less

00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,860
HTTP requests to handle and in some

00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,960
cases no requests to handle because you

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,900
can have it in line and then you're not

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,670
making any requests at all and the thing

00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,330
that's the fastest request is no

00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,950
requests so it's also easily scalable

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,530
for responsive we're gonna talk about

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,970
that a bit that's probably one of my

00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,160
favorite parts of this and that's

00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:32,310
probably part part of the reason why it

00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,030
has gotten so much giant popularity

00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,460
lately

00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:37,290
that's a really really important one and

00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,610
it can be a really small file size if

00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,410
you design for performance

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,690
if you design for performance is a

00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:44,670
really important concept here not all

00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,890
designs are gonna be created equal you

00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,840
can't just like throw massive things in

00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,630
there it's built with math which is

00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,700
really awesome you can do such crazy

00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:56,190
things with it and very unique things

00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,660
with it but if you load it up it's not

00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,970
like a bitmap where you're just like

00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,050
pixel pixel pixel pixel you have to pay

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:05,100
attention to what you're actually

00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:07,560
putting in there it offers a navigable

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,810
Dom which is super awesome because it's

00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,060
easy to animate you already know the Dom

00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,610
adding a class to something and then

00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,560
animating it is stuff that you already

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,750
know you don't have to learn any new

00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,930
material in order to animate pieces of

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,990
an SVG and it's easy to make accessible

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:28,170
how cool is that you can have a creative

00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,640
crazy immersive experience with data

00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,490
visualization and lots of information

00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,800
and it can be accessible to screen

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,990
readers that's one of my favorite parts

00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,610
like you no longer just have these

00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,310
images with alt tags you can actually

00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,680
have them looking for bits that you want

00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:46,620
them to or go over the whole thing if

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,060
you don't want them to so you know I

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,580
hear a lot of times people say like

00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,730
flash is dead but we really miss it and

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,740
well you know I kind of think SVG

00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:57,720
animation is more fun than Flash I I

00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,940
think like people kind of got stuck in

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,039
the like oh flash was so good at all

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,169
lista but there's so many capabilities

00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,509
that we have now with SVG animation that

00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:08,820
people haven't even tapped into so what

00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:10,799
is it good for it's good for interactive

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,679
and immersive animations it's good for

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,090
narrative it's good for UI UX animations

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,279
like the ones that you just saw like

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,350
that morphing pin it's great for

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,850
prototyping because it's easy like the

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:24,450
designer gives you a sketch in that

00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,799
sketch is the webpage that's great and

00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,389
it's really awesome for data

00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:31,440
visualizations because it's built with

00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:34,879
math so if we're looking at this pen in

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,879
terms of narrative

00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,930
there's a lot that you can do just with

00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,760
one image and picture and just by moving

00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:05,040
some text around in terms of

00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,840
communicating a story and in terms of

00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,740
making an engaging experience for the

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,330
user actually Sarah Sweden showed this

00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:14,550
my demo I had a conference and then she

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:20,570
was like oh how many introverts are out

00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:23,580
there raise your hand and like nobody so

00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:25,470
hmm what's really really cool about it

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,120
too is that it can be responsive so if

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,410
I'm gonna do like a book of Kelly I

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,670
don't know if you any of you have heard

00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,090
of book of kells so these beautiful

00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:34,800
illuminated manuscripts and they did

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,450
these like initial illustrations so they

00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,790
take the first letter and they make it

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,460
kind of beautiful so I decided to make a

00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:43,470
modern-day book of kells and so this

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,780
would be like the desktop version and

00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,190
then this is the tablet version and then

00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,230
this is the mobile version so you can

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,660
see it gets like less and less visually

00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,580
complex and you know kind of adjusts to

00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,100
each viewport in that way so that's the

00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,800
design when I when I poured it over to

00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,750
like create the actual SVG I make a

00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,690
sprite out of it because I'm saying like

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:06,600
okay well I see some repeated things

00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,620
between the like desktop and the tablet

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,810
version and I can just change the

00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,660
background with a color change like just

00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:14,160
a media query that's pretty easy I'll

00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,450
slap some classes on some of the

00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,400
repeated elements and I'll hide and

00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,500
display them with media queries just the

00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,410
way that we're used to and then I can

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,300
have this like this other piece and I'll

00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,240
use the view box which is a really

00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:30,660
awesome tool that SVG has to just hide

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,090
and display pieces of that sprite as it

00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:40,730
changes so then I can have something

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:44,460
like this where it's like an animated

00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:46,380
effects and it goes all the way down and

00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:50,130
then we have this kind of book of kells

00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:53,700
that changes and what's nice about this

00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:57,090
is that whole animation and SVG

00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:01,080
everything and the text was 8 kilobytes

00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:03,330
gzipped so compare that to using text

00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,220
and image to tell a story like big

00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,870
photos that everybody is using all over

00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,790
the place that are really huge

00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,080
performance hits for websites you can

00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:13,740
make something in

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,460
gauging informative interesting and that

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:19,649
can be in performance and you could be

00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,419
accessible all of these things you don't

00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:23,039
have to compromise anything I think a

00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:24,809
lot of times when people see something

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,250
kind of interesting on the web they

00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,779
think like oh we have to compromise

00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:31,260
something in order to get there

00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:33,149
you don't have to compromise anything so

00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,010
we'll talk a little bit about green sock

00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:36,390
I won't be able to go into tons of

00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,669
detail because I don't have tons of time

00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:41,730
but it's a really good tool for working

00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:43,380
with SVG animation one of my favorite

00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,880
reasons for working with green sock and

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,769
probably the reason why I talk about it

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,830
so much is because it's I don't work for

00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:52,049
them by the way it's because it solves

00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,610
cross browser inconsistencies there's a

00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:56,570
lot of weirdnesses that you'll get in

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:59,490
Safari and especially Safari and Firefox

00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:03,480
and stuff and this really really helps

00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:05,880
solve all of those I still doesn't

00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,809
support transforms on SVG ie get it

00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,429
together seriously if you if you want to

00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:13,799
go vote for this they'd like definitely

00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:15,690
do I should have put a link to that in

00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,580
the slides or something but definitely

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:21,450
go vote for support for transforms and

00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:23,940
SVG it also offers a timeline which is

00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,590
super great because you can stack tweens

00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,519
you can set them a little before and

00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,870
after one another

00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,940
you can change their placement in time

00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,519
you can group them into scenes you can

00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:36,450
add relative labels you can animate your

00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:37,950
animations and you can make the whole

00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,110
thing faster and move the placement of

00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:43,080
the whole thing and nest everything so I

00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,909
think it is like an incredible tool for

00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,929
animation and what's really nice about

00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:46,799
it is you can do it without

00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:49,169
recalculation

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,230
I love CSS and I did the last pen and

00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:53,820
CSS but the issue with it is sometimes

00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,830
these recalculations because like let's

00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,690
say I have two animations that have to

00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,880
fire at the same time and someone says

00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:02,070
okay make that one a little bit smaller

00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,870
and I have a bunch of delays after it I

00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:06,570
have a bunch of chain defects I didn't

00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:09,210
have to go back and figure out like all

00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:11,250
redo all of the math for all of those

00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,760
and figure out all the delays for both

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:17,129
and it's kind of a pain but in with gzip

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,990
and JavaScript it's a lot easier to work

00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:21,929
with your you're changing one value

00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:23,500
instead of 10 so anytime you're working

00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:26,409
with like a small

00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,090
bit of ui/ux animation I think CSS is

00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:29,740
great anytime you have to chain

00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,480
something or make something more complex

00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,070
and you get beyond three chaining x' i

00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,679
really suggest working working with

00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,990
something like g sap and javascript so

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,790
we have this pen to kind of demonstrate

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:42,490
I'll actually open this in another

00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:44,710
window so I made this like this kind of

00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:47,440
animation and this one thing fires a few

00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:50,320
times and it kind of goes around and

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,960
just to show you how the timeline works

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,909
I can call a function for that and then

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,870
I can call it repeated times on that

00:34:54,909 --> 00:35:03,700
timeline and then I can have that like

00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:06,010
first section and it goes here and then

00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,780
I can have like that other section and

00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,640
that's plotted to this point and the

00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,170
timeline you can see it so I probably

00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,200
don't need to narrate it for you but

00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,150
it's kind of fun anyway so you have a

00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,370
menu of this next section and it gets it

00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:21,160
it's put here so I can actually just

00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:24,550
then just change the order of them in

00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:29,370
one line of code and have the whole

00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:32,320
thing run in a different direction or I

00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:33,670
could say okay it just wasn't fast

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,450
enough so I just want to make it a bunch

00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:40,330
faster and in one line of code that's

00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:42,340
like totally achievable so that's really

00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:44,320
powerful and makes working with

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:48,850
animation a lot less tangled and

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:52,510
confusing so the other cool thing about

00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:54,070
SVG is we can do fully fully scalable

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,210
and responsive stuff because you're what

00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,980
you're doing is you're working within

00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,140
the SVG Dom so even if you're plotting

00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:03,310
with transforms it's working within that

00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:05,820
SVG Dom structure so I can make this any

00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:08,440
size and it's gonna stay totally stable

00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,230
absolutely stable which is obviously

00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,120
like really huge boon to responsive

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,740
development I can just keep replaying

00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,690
this and making it different sizes

00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,550
that's pretty cool

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,560
but you know our anime are like

00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,970
interfaces aren't just squishy they

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,100
don't just like squish back and forth

00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:26,560
but let's implement a bit of responsive

00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,270
design here so if we design interactions

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,570
into responsive animations we're gonna

00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:34,150
make a huggy laser panda Factory yes as

00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:35,260
was mentioned before you know like you

00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,480
have in real life

00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:40,000
hardly Laser panda factories

00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,160
so we have the desktop version here in

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,990
the mobile version here and you can see

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,190
that there's like different sections to

00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:48,640
this so they're kind of like Legos

00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:50,890
here's one here's another this one is

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,080
this one but it's just flipped around to

00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:55,510
stack and then they kind of nest in

00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,570
there and we have different timelines

00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:01,630
and those timelines are scoped exactly

00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:04,210
to those design pieces like Legos - so

00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,160
our code is scoped like our design is

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:08,320
and if I have to adjust something I know

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,730
exactly where to go in that illustrator

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,590
document and I know exactly where to go

00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,540
in my code it keeps everything really

00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:17,110
nice and neat and organized and very

00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:19,600
simple so if we have like this and we

00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:22,420
have the factory so I click this and he

00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,420
becomes like lasered and he's evil and

00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:28,660
then we have this any beak-like becomes

00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:31,090
a panda and then we do this and he's

00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,750
like all of a sudden I'm very huggy and

00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:37,840
I can scroll my browser window down and

00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:43,900
it reconfigures and it still works

00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:46,060
perfectly on mobile and this all was

00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,940
like 12 kilobytes gzipped

00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,920
so that's kind of fun and kind of

00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,170
interesting and there's a lot of stuff

00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,810
that we can do on the web that we have

00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:58,210
not done yet that is really engaging and

00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:00,550
exciting part of you know I mentioned

00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,650
accessibility accessibility is a giant

00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,660
thing here I could have like gone

00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,060
through and labeled each one of the

00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,010
things that I was just firing off and to

00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,870
tell the story of the Panda to people

00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,760
who need a screen reader I can also say

00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:16,510
something like roll presentation and

00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,430
have it skip over that whole SVG Dom if

00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:21,190
you are gonna use things like titles do

00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:24,250
remember to use things like IDs this

00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:26,410
isn't just about SVG or anything that's

00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:29,380
that's like an important thing for you

00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:31,690
to note when you say Aria labeled by

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:35,410
title it's a lot easier for jaws and

00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:36,820
NVIDIA to find the title here and it's

00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,110
also important to have the language on

00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,790
there too so that people in different

00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:42,250
countries can actually have it be

00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:44,080
translated so I'm not going to go into

00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,640
giant details about accessibility again

00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,620
because we don't have time but there's a

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,990
resource here with support charts and

00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,619
this article by Heather is really really

00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,989
awesome and

00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:55,779
CSS tricks and she goes into like every

00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:58,420
kind of SVG and how to make all of them

00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:59,559
accessible so that's a really great

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,410
resource I think she went to the library

00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:03,969
like every Sunday testing everything on

00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,349
every device that she put a ton of time

00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:06,849
and effort into it so you should

00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:15,190
definitely use that resource and make

00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:20,170
good use of it so I made a game we're

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:23,440
gonna play it real quick so there's this

00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:27,039
elephant he's pretty good tacos but his

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,319
friends keep texting him to change plans

00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,880
even though he just wants to tacos and

00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:34,010
so you have to like play this game and

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,740
try not to get hit by the text messages

00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:39,980
there's a margarita attitude so it's

00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:44,000
based off of real-life events of this

00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:46,130
hipster elephant and all of this was

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,020
built with SVG and react and you can

00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:50,990
kind of see this like art leader up here

00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:56,420
is gonna change as I get like more and

00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:58,430
less and yeah if you lose you like you

00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:02,810
become hangry and you have to go see a

00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:05,020
movie that you've already seen before so

00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:07,100
all of this stuff was created with web

00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,780
technologies it was created with react

00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:11,930
it was created with SVG and was created

00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,940
with green sock how did we use SVG here

00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:15,950
we used it three ways we did it just

00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,750
directly in line for things that were

00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:19,369
looping across we had things like

00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,540
background images for stuff like the

00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:22,609
tacos that we're gonna always stay the

00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,640
same size and we had it in line and

00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:27,200
react and I'll show you why we did

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,580
here's a heart meter even if you're not

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,050
familiar with react I'll walk you

00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,420
through it's not gonna be a lot of code

00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:35,840
here we have this thing called width in

00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:38,300
this SVG for this rect and it's passing

00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,700
down that's not prop score and what that

00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:43,010
that this dot prop score is doing is

00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:45,859
telling it what our score is and it's

00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:48,710
gonna update that width so what's cool

00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:50,330
about SVG since it's drawn with math is

00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,520
that when you have something like a

00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:55,340
rectangle all you have is a width a

00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,640
height an X and a Y value so if I say

00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:01,160
something like 250 for the width it

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,410
updates and makes the line longer that's

00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,140
makes it really easy to work with and

00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:08,270
just like update and change so that's

00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,160
really really cool and that's why we can

00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:14,720
use something like that very very easily

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,820
for the web how do we animate things we

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,980
animated them four ways we did G SAP

00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:21,440
looping the green sock G stop looping

00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,270
functions outside of react for like the

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,850
clouds and things we had

00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:28,400
requestanimationframe to see if things

00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,650
hit each other we had green sock for

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,240
keys app for key press events and those

00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,340
key press events are just native key

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,170
press events and then we had a repeating

00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:39,140
callbacks for the tacos and margaritas

00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:42,500
you know your regular repeating taco

00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,960
callback and we're just having it go

00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,390
again and again so this is like a G SAP

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,640
function where when it finished

00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:51,170
it's gonna pass those parameters again

00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,420
so that they can move across the screen

00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:59,660
again and the code is actually pretty

00:41:53,420 --> 00:42:02,930
simple to create a fun game so this is

00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:04,760
smoke with SVG I think I'm showing you

00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,770
this because I think people tend to

00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,890
think of SVG is only being these like

00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:11,840
linear kind of like platonic shapes and

00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:14,150
that you can't do a lot of like really

00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,430
fun and beautiful things with it but

00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:19,220
with things like filters and things like

00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:23,390
gradients you can create really ethereal

00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:25,670
and elemental effects Chris Chris here

00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:32,090
in the audience invented SVG so he's

00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:34,040
making faces at me right now you can

00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,990
also make things like candles you can

00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,720
make things morph and change you can

00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:41,780
make all sorts of beautiful effects that

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,400
actually look earthly with something

00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,280
that is built in math and I think that

00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,080
is just super cool so I'm showing you

00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,450
all of that to let you know that the web

00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,370
has so much potential and we've only hit

00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,920
the tip of the iceberg there's so many

00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,150
things that we can do without

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,300
sacrificing performance without

00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,340
sacrificing engagement without

00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:03,740
sacrificing accessibility in fact making

00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,930
accessibility better so even all

00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,340
technologies by recombining them and by

00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:09,530
thinking about them in a different way

00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:11,540
and by thinking about our users we can

00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:14,330
actually make the web be performant and

00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:17,570
beautiful I do these web animation

00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:19,250
workshops with Val head we you know go

00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,630
around and teach people workshops so if

00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:24,110
you want us to come near you

00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:26,060
you can there's like a thing on our site

00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,800
where you can let us know I think we're

00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,260
gonna go to San Francisco next year and

00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,110
also Europe and stuff so check that out

00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:35,150
and I'm also writing an SVG animation

00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:38,180
book this is not the cover of that book

00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:41,270
this was my friend trolling me I don't

00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:44,600
have the man blog animal I that's not

00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:47,510
even my last name I do have a fancy

00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,040
chicken though this the early release

00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:50,990
for this book is coming out in a few

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,490
weeks I think so chapters one through

00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:55,790
six and then the rest will come out

00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:57,650
sometime in March I believe so we'll

00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:02,530
we'll kind of keep going with these

00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:02,530
