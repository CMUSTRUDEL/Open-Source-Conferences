Title: Sarah Drasner: Functional Animation - CSSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-05
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	Animation is captivating. Our brains are trained to respond most intently to movement. For this reason, animation in a user experience is extremely important, and also very easy to overdo. Carefully considered animation can compose spatial maps to guide users. Animations can be responsive, resolution-independent, and make a site function intuitively.
In this session Sarah will cover a myriad of use cases, from both design and technical implementation standpoints.

Sarah is an award-winning Manager of UX Design and Engineering at Trulia (Zillow) and staff writer at CSS-Tricks.
She’s given a Frontend Masters workshop on Advanced SVG Animations, and is working for a book for O’Reilly on SVG Animations. 
For 15 years she worked as a web developer and designer and at points as a Scientific Illustrator, an Undergraduate Professor and has tutored a Byzantine Icon painter in Santorini.
Sarah loves SVG, informative animation, and welding together pieces of the DOM.
