Title: Kenneth Ormandy: Syntax Highlight Everything - CSSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-01
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	A developer employs syntax highlighting to visually differentiate portions of her code; for centuries, designers, printers, and scribes have done the same for readers. Today, advanced features built into fonts can subtly signify types of content, increase a text’s authority, and are actually necessary for many languages.
This talk introduces designers and developers to highlighting
syntaxes beyond code. Learn how to access these advanced typographic features using CSS and JavaScript, and—more importantly—where to apply them.
Kenneth is an independent designer specialising in web typography. He organises Vancouver’s typography meetup Type
Brigade, and contributes to The Lost Type Co-op. Previously he studied type design at Type@Paris, and helped launch the front-end development tool Surge.sh.
