Title: Soledad PenadÃ©s: Make Websites, Not Apps - CSSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-04
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	Is there any point in building mobile websites when Android is pretty much the market leader in mobile? Has the web lost the battle to native apps? Should we just give up and write everything in React Native? Does progressive enhancement even make sense at all? And what about CSS - does anyone understand it? Is there any point in learning HTML in 2016?
In this talk, we will get answers to these and many more questions that we ask ourselves on a daily basis (even if we won't admit to it). You will leave reinvigorated, full of optimism and pride in your craft.
100% guaranteed.

Sole has been building real time stuff for longer than she can remember.
She works at Mozilla, helping making the Web the best platform (in general) and the best platform for realtime (in particular).
She writes demos to test and spread awareness about new features, often involving Web Audio, WebGL, GIFs and/or cats.
In the process she breaks various browsers and reports an unspeakable number of strange edge cases, all in pursuit of a robust platform that is a joy to develop for.

	00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:16,480
I haven't been in Singapore for even a

00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:18,310
whole day so I'm like that's trying to

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,349
stay with your dreamy and sleepy and

00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,500
everything seems with an amazing of the

00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:28,449
center so if something I'm saying sounds

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,500
weird it's my current jet lag state so

00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:30,940
when I come back to learn that you

00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,829
should ask me the same question and it

00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:39,909
would make more sense so that's it yeah

00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:43,210
so I'm self-analysis jason said I worked

00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:44,409
for Mozilla I am in the London office so

00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,999
that means right now is like three or

00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:50,319
four a.m. my time and I'm I just been

00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:52,269
the devil team I just moved to the

00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:53,889
Firefox of those same because I wanted

00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:57,069
to make the tools better so I'm now an

00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:59,280
interview manager there and I'm not

00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:03,280
Spanish as you can say i'm not very like

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,040
sending English very English so because

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,990
English is not my first language I do

00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,810
think that native speakers don't which

00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,880
is wonder about the language so when I

00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,780
feel expressions like it's raining cats

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,490
and dogs I'm like what so I went to the

00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,740
internet and i searched what that means

00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:24,220
and it brings you back to an old time

00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,380
where the streets were full of provision

00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,660
dead animals and when it rained it

00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,490
rained so hard that it would just carry

00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,110
away all the dead animals so that's what

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,390
it means that when it's raining cats and

00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,550
dogs and another expression that has

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,240
been interesting to me lately it's been

00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,560
going against the grain and so again I

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,650
wish I'd what does this actually mean

00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,510
and the dictionary says that is contrary

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,909
to natural inclination of feeling of

00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,010
someone or something it goes against the

00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,080
grain to tell outright lies from the

00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,780
fact that food is easy to cut along the

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,640
lane the line of the grain and I am a

00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,800
software developer in session r idea how

00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,440
you cut wood so I went to the internet

00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,210
again and it's told me that it was easy

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,940
to cut along the grain and across the

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,830
grain I still didn't know what did mean

00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,050
because you know like even Buddha would

00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,659
use nowadays is fake so I'm like I don't

00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:17,300
know but the internet is amazing it gave

00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:19,280
me a diagram so it shows you what along

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,200
close the crime mins so it was like oh

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,940
yeah those timber people like when they

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,160
go with the arcs if they go with the

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,690
arcs across this line is very easy you

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,520
get your visit up they are cutting a

00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,530
tree that in that direction but you

00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,940
never see them cut on the other action

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:36,320
you see them but it takes them longer

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,510
it's not like one clean cut so the oil

00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,430
interesting fact the internet told me is

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,280
that the bull is also stronger along the

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,140
grain so if you give a caretaker one of

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,720
those plans the first one is going to be

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,570
harder to kind of like just slicing just

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,850
one hit the second one which you can't

00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,620
really see very well but it's like cut

00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,750
in the other direction so this is going

00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,590
to break you can see that this is like

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,850
total set out like if a kratika can cut

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,740
that you know that it's not a very good

00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,970
caretaker so my car was very interesting

00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,070
another thing that the internet show me

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,500
is an a demo of days with the spaghetti

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,630
so you can see this is blood grain

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,220
fibers and you can see that this is the

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,290
effect that you will get when you cut

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:23,120
with an axe along the direction of the

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:24,860
grain so the other final call saying

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,989
that the internet tell me about both and

00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,340
grains is that you also need to keep

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:31,190
this thing in mind when you apply polish

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,170
or you get these scratches which are

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,540
awful this is what happens when you can

00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:38,480
affect some against the direction of the

00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,550
grain sound like this is so cool like

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,200
the crane is intrinsic to the balls so

00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,350
if you do things properly you can like

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,970
very nice finish product they are really

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,430
nice to look at your like oh this is

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,959
like good artisanal crafty work but if

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,820
you don't do that if you just ignore the

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,670
fact that bull has grain you get things

00:03:52,820 --> 00:04:00,170
that Flint's a scratch or brittle they

00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:02,540
break and you're like interesting I was

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,330
like like this I'm a screen like yeah

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,860
this sounds familiar this is just like

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,660
more than web development we're just

00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,520
ignoring the grain we're just doing

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,519
whatever we think it's cool and then

00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,190
everything breaks and it's like I don't

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,769
know what you did here and all the talks

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,630
today have been mentioned a like prison

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,280
use bootstrap please don't do these

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,110
please don't break the browser's I'm

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,210
like this is very good because you like

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,970
telling things I'm really caring about

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:33,300
so what's the web natural direction and

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,640
I'm going to be captain obvious but hTML

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,830
free content is a representation and

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,350
generous giver functionality you would

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:44,010
think that people would know the things

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,480
nowadays but no so when you build with

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,550
these principles in mind you're cutting

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,990
along the green which is the good thing

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,020
and you're playing to the website

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,820
strengths I would go into more detail

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,530
but that's basically what I want to like

00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:00,930
hint I can stress today even if this is

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,640
just a CSS conference CSS is so

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,660
connected to everything you can't just

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,550
take one thing and ignore the rest so

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,470
you build websites this way they're

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,710
delightful to use because you know the

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:17,760
browser can do the browser job and also

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,620
still there also job so let the browser

00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,350
do what I can do like you know like

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,470
stretch things around zoom in zoom out

00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,060
the kind of things use keyboards that

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,040
kind of things that process let you do

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,960
when you don't mess with the browser and

00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,250
then you can just fill the gaps for

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,290
extra things that the president doesn't

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,750
know yet and maybe it will do the

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:40,440
feature if enough also ask the browser

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,270
vendors to do that so some developers

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,530
will against the web natural direction

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:48,750
they say i want to have full control but

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,340
what happens is like they interfere with

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,290
the browser and you end up with those

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,850
things like the little cross as Chris

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,430
was mentioning where you kind of press

00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,980
ask you cannot press the cross you kind

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,990
of tap away because there is no normal

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,120
interface like nothing works as a

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,000
respect so that's very frustrating to

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,060
use or do you go for presale tix are

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,370
perfect device this is bad but it's even

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,380
worse and phones when you have an

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,540
android phone and you get off an iphone

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,540
do i because they want to make things

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,070
native or when you have an iphone and

00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,410
you get material design and you're like

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,390
I don't know what this is anymore this

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:28,950
is all very strange so this is the

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:31,350
uncanny valley of UI design or you get

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:34,620
this long time for requests to render

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:37,560
where you like waiting and waiting I can

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,040
fill this a lot because I used roaming a

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,530
lot

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,810
when I'm traveling alone and when you're

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,600
and roaming I pani your data goes

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:49,950
through your server in your country so

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,010
it takes long so you're like waiting and

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,910
waiting I eventually just give up

00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,470
especially when you don't get any render

00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,410
at all when something breaks on the

00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,810
meantime there is a timeout nothing

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,490
renders and you're like okay fine I just

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,610
wanted to see the many on your website

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,620
but now i'm not going to your restaurant

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,960
so they all think that but developer

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,490
store is ignoring aspects that exist in

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,280
the platform it's like ignoring the

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,490
grain they assume that there is no

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,910
network like things magically come to

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,070
your device they also know that the

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,440
browser raises many of the things they

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,900
are implementing and they also ignore

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,730
all the uses like I really like the top

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,890
from craves like make things work with

00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:33,210
universal design it's a bit like the

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,070
kind of things I'm worried about it's

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:39,060
like they're like oh were crying my

00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:41,520
computer with my super accurate mobility

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,070
but you try to give them to other people

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,320
and you can't they can't use the

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,180
products they're like I this is this

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,700
menu this rule over men is too far for

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:55,110
me I can't focus and it can make people

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,790
cry it's really they also know that the

00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,390
web environment is unpredictable and

00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:03,210
it's unknown it's not just about people

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:06,390
using strange forms of people using

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:09,960
things on 3g and 40 or whatever it's all

00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:12,570
about people installing plugins on their

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,300
browsers and also about people using

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,760
websites with things like assistive

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,310
technology stuff like screen readers or

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:24,390
like even real reader mode is a version

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:26,430
of assistive technology you can have so

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,960
many things in the environment that you

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,430
kind of read trusted javascript your

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,240
road is a javascript is going to be

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:35,070
executed so if you expect that your

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,290
whole app is going to work because you

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,030
assume this kind of like idea of pure

00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:43,560
JavaScript environment you're going to

00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:44,970
like set fall for a disaster so what

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,150
happens is the day to implement things

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,950
are exist battling and then they create

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,649
junk accessibility things that cannot be

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,259
used or things are just

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,240
drain battery and it's like all terrible

00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:59,269
and Bob and it makes me so sad and so

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,379
upset at the same time and this is all

00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:05,149
because we want to make an appt and now

00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:07,430
so the private days is that the

00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:10,309
developers of this kind of apps I like I

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:14,749
really hate web development this is so

00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:17,029
awful and terrible they go to medium and

00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:19,339
blood a post about how terrible web

00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:22,790
government is nowadays and it's like so

00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:25,059
awful and then people hate using these

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,660
kind of things because they are so

00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:32,720
against users their aunt Alice's

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:36,259
traveling here too I am up fold at this

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,420
I have have bosses insisting had to be

00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:40,490
picture-perfect and things like that I'm

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,259
like you know the web is not about pics

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:46,519
a favor and keep it be like no it has to

00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:49,459
be perfect so yeah we've been there it's

00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,889
it's something that happens but the

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,329
thing that really makes me really upset

00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:54,889
this one I might you sir because I'm

00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:57,290
like you could have done it the other

00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:59,870
way and you still chose to do it this or

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:03,769
a terrible way so I'm here more as a

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,449
user than as a developer so you would

00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,249
not think that this is a solution but

00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:09,110
there is a solution and it's making

00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:13,040
watches not making apps and I'm just

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:15,499
like again captain obvious the things

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,350
that the websites like building website

00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:22,639
has this almost 30 years old of

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:25,610
experience behind so if you cannot be

00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:28,100
some breakfast so a framework if you

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,649
come up with a framework it's not going

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,559
to have those 30 years of experience and

00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:36,199
standards and consensus and discussions

00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:38,749
so your framework is not going to last

00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:40,459
for longer than the website and I

00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:41,839
properly build website is going to last

00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:44,449
longer than any type of Griffin would

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,429
you could possibly build so for example

00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:48,769
I want to show you something really cool

00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:51,259
which is the first website I can still

00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:53,889
open with my current browser can you

00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:57,529
imagine opening nobody's browsers like

00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:59,689
nobody's websites with current with

00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:05,209
these first browser it will be

00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:08,839
impossible candle so it's it's really

00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:10,459
some food for thought so how do we do

00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:15,499
this thing because I'm just like being

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:16,819
angry here so again captain obvious you

00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:18,889
need to start by architect in your

00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:22,309
content and design in your content so

00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:24,199
what is what your users need like you

00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:25,879
can't start saying we're going to use

00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:27,319
this framework that's not how you start

00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:31,429
their content you need to start thinking

00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:35,509
about what do they use this name do they

00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:37,339
need a single bay web page up maybe they

00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:39,050
just need if it's a restaurant sample

00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:40,730
many opening times booking form

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,629
something like that like that that's the

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,110
kind of question we should be asking

00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:47,149
yourself do I need to load a full

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,350
templating engine to render a blog or

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:50,569
maybe you could just friended I on your

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,730
server and cash it forever so you don't

00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:57,529
waste energy in the world the kind of

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:59,179
ideas is what I'm going through etc so

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:00,769
once you know what you want to actually

00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:02,689
mean I mean this is I'm just saying

00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:04,670
about progressive and his men but once

00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:07,160
you know what you want to build you just

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:11,480
use it smell and turns out that age to

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,429
my right self has lots of features cool

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,040
things the advanced browsers are going

00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:18,470
to be nicer to the users but older

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,670
browsers will be just functional so they

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,709
don't know as much suggest ignore

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,499
whatever they don't know about so for

00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:28,009
example if you have an anchor and you

00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:30,559
say H ref tell lalalala a phone number

00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:32,480
if a browser knows about that when you

00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,369
click on the phone number it will say I

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,899
mean if the presonus about and your rind

00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:37,549
is in a phone they would be like that

00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,619
you want to call this number and this is

00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:42,319
just extending something that the webmin

00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:45,290
readers which is showing you links if

00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:47,749
you use pattern in form inputs you can

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,920
have regular expression validation built

00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:51,319
in the forms you don't need to pull a

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,449
library to do this thing if you use

00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:55,339
input time number and you use this thing

00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:57,319
in a device like a phone as well which

00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:00,319
is like cumbersome to type numbers and

00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:03,920
things which is a very small screen it

00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:06,019
will bring a special dial kind of like

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,059
styling keyboards so you make things

00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,799
easy for your users in the proper

00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,869
context so you're kind of like given the

00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,839
browser hints as to what kind of content

00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:17,180
it is and the browser or the user agent

00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,030
is going to be like okay I'm going

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:23,150
to help you do these things and that

00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:25,970
works when you use XML correctly if you

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,980
just use diffs and sponge and you don't

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,140
markup things properly the browser has

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:34,790
no clue of what you want to do so it's

00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:38,450
not going to help you and then CSS this

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,910
is what we're here for we need to go

00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,650
bottom up a game like it was very cool

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,940
that Rachel also explained this thing

00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,130
like you need to start with the most

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,500
basic browser and I would like to say

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,510
that every router can be a basic browser

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,610
at some point when you don't get all the

00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:56,000
sites loaded or when something kind of a

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:59,240
mrs. out the load it can become a basic

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,200
browser so an even when sometimes you

00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,730
get like a mobile website URL sent to

00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,470
you that's the computer and there is no

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,390
detection or whatsoever you end up with

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,250
a basic kind of like version of the

00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,010
website so I want to still get proper

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,170
content so you need to start here and

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,910
make sure he did say in default for

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:20,300
those basic browsers like many people

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,940
just specify the gradient but they don't

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,550
specify the base background so when you

00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,380
try to use some websites with browsers

00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,170
like opera mini that strip out the

00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,140
complicated CSS properties if you didn't

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,150
specify the background and the gradient

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,040
says this is a dark background and the

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,320
text is like black you can took it like

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,780
black over black which is not exactly

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,340
what you wanted to do so you you're like

00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:47,360
making things difficult for yourself you

00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,130
didn't just a cascade properly am also

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,840
please don't use proprietary prefixes

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,490
but if you really need to use

00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,060
preprocessor so you make sure that you

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,740
don't miss out on any perfect and again

00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,120
these supports if that's something that

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,980
you have to learn today please your

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,470
support so you don't send things to

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:06,140
process that don't understand them and

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,700
always be learning like the cool thing

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,800
of CSS is that they seen that is always

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,350
the same more or less it's not changing

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,880
a lot so new things that you learn you

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,070
can use you don't need to forget the

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,530
things if you're free a new and also if

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,990
you understand CSS it's going to be like

00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,610
great because you are not going to just

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,960
like copy things from the internet it's

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:28,160
going to be really good because then you

00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:31,070
can buy things your own so like I guess

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,180
rewatching Rachel's talk and the count

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,430
it's going to be really really cool

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,080
because you can like remember the things

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,350
that she's been suggesting and like

00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,690
learning really how things like the new

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,550
things work and just like and learn the

00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,820
new things they all things that we used

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:50,840
to use and this is my special for you we

00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:53,150
part of ESS ESS developer like your real

00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,260
developer no don't tell don't let people

00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,880
tell you you might have really available

00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,410
because you're just writing JavaScript

00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,810
like well you know what India is good

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,260
you are a real developer and writing

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,090
good CSS is really available if you

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,250
write good size you can have with so

00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,170
many lines of Battier you have a script

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,610
code and it's going to be all so fast

00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,330
and more performant because the browser

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,860
is going to like be like Oh CSS I know

00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,630
how to the listing and I'm going to be

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,210
hard we're accelerating days and i'm

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,160
going to use less energy so that's going

00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:25,010
to be better for mobile users which

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,020
happen to be a lot of people so feel

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:31,370
proud to be CSS developers you aren't

00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:33,320
great so then when you are like oh yes

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,060
some CSS developer when you get to

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,370
javascript please be it really wise

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,100
again the way with great power comes

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:43,220
great responsibility Janice can break

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,660
things really badly so please don't send

00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:48,170
things the browsers that don't know

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:50,000
other things so there is this polyfill

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:53,570
service by the FT they will make sure

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,820
that things are like properly like all

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,980
the gaps are properly pulley field and

00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,260
you can also configure that so it

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,960
doesn't send the whole thing of like the

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,000
whole list of polyfills this is my

00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,980
personal personal advisors programmer

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,930
please use feature libraries or

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,030
frameworks like maybe you're just going

00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,920
to use a fraction of all the powers not

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,209
a framework is offering you so maybe

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,079
just try to use the little thing that

00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:20,510
you need and if you really master please

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,300
use frames with axe ability built-in not

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:26,329
just like I saw frame with the other day

00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,920
I say oh mobile is not at the top of our

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:31,420
priority it's not what they said I'm

00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:34,880
like are you from the 90s like seriously

00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:37,700
and remember that no frames is a silver

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,620
bullet like just by choosing booster up

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,850
or react or whatever you want to use

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,640
it's not going to sort out your issues

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,930
like if your content is bound at a time

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:50,480
no frameworks going to fix your content

00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:53,110
things to watch out for is at tracking

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,360
and all stuff I interface with browsers

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,940
it's very interesting to know how to

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,040
learn how two hours rendering pipeline

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,070
works and how you know like when

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,950
resources don't know they how it affects

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,510
with what the browser is doing how how

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,130
things are stopped waiting for other

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,750
things to parse and accounting and

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,429
especially if you're going to be

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,929
inserting apps and things that your boss

00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:16,490
is going to tell you how we really need

00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:19,280
to track this thing you need to bring

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:22,150
them up like every time you are then

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,800
beacon this is going to slow things down

00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,270
so they need to know that when they

00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,380
don't make money with the website that

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:32,240
is a reason behind that so if you could

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,040
measure things if you have data you can

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,929
argue with them every time we add this

00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,970
thing we have this drop in sales or

00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:41,900
whatever so you need data to be able to

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,760
remove the crabs later and also watch

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,809
out for content that we just no display

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,480
if javascript breaks like for example if

00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:52,250
all your content requires loading a big

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,290
chunk of JavaScript and parsing the

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,890
thing it just won't display in basic

00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:59,540
browsers so my the crux of this is if

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,070
you really want to replace something a

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,160
browser is doing you better know what

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:06,440
you're doing because honestly browsers

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,570
are a complicated piece of machinery so

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,460
the thing is that when you're like young

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,830
and ambitious you think you can do

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,870
better but often that's not the case so

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:18,670
the reason the browser is a big thing is

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:22,400
because there is a reason for that so

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:24,410
important this is not like a server-side

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,200
conference but this is important as well

00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,150
and it's like it's not sexy or cool or

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,470
whatever and I hate sexy applied to

00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:35,570
technology but service is important

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,880
because in basic browsers and in like

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:40,370
all in like all new phones server-side

00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,500
rendering is still faster than every

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,740
possible JavaScript improved performance

00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,290
whatever just giving people render HTML

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,670
and they just they can just like okay I

00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,299
know how to do this thing where as

00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:54,659
everything else that you can put in

00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:57,149
way is going to have a very long time

00:19:54,659 --> 00:20:00,899
for requests to render and people are

00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:03,809
going to abandon their website so and do

00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:05,580
you need a thing anyway react lets you

00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:07,230
do this I mean the reason people just

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,809
react is because they can do this it's a

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,249
morphic JavaScript and serve just in PHP

00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,779
which is not fashionable anymore

00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:15,629
apparently even if it keeps doing the

00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:17,549
job and server side validation is a

00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:19,499
still require so if you get data from

00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,169
the outside world you need to still

00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:28,289
validate so why not do like everything

00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:30,929
together again let me stress this server

00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:33,029
side validation insisted required you

00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,619
can't trust people from the outside you

00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:38,100
can't trust the people of range of

00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:40,049
JavaScript front side up and not getting

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,480
junk injected because you know a lot of

00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:45,659
viruses that can take over browsers and

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,399
some crap to people through the browser

00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:50,700
even if they are affiliated and things

00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:54,419
like that so don't trust front end all

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:57,119
the time and also in this is very funny

00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,919
but this it's very easy to get gains

00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,649
from this from checking server

00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:05,279
configuration for caching and just also

00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:07,769
things like enabling compression I just

00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,600
work in a place that were said we were

00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:13,259
serving like this was before iphone

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,440
existed and just enabling jzip made us

00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:19,919
like super fast like we save so much in

00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,749
bad ways and and I said that it was

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,730
before the iPhone because my boss have

00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:25,649
one of those Nokia's that were super

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,499
advanced back in the time and he was

00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:30,090
like now I can open this website on the

00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:31,919
phone which I couldn't do before because

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,049
it was it was just timing out but with

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,299
jay-z been able it was short enough that

00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:38,730
he could just get the whole thing so

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:40,139
it's funny is like just simple easy

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,409
things you can do and then you get

00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:46,139
really good gains I'm also related to

00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:48,720
faster transmissions consider HTTP two

00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:52,859
is a talk about this later and then you

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,749
require HTTPS 482 DP 2 and also for

00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:56,429
privacy sensitive aph like service

00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:59,789
workers on a la la which I'm really

00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:01,490
briefly mention later to diagnose you

00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:04,370
can use developer tools

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:07,160
the the network panel and you can see

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:09,290
the Heather's have been returned when I

00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,000
don't know what the crew won but the

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:15,380
fire festival to have something where

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,150
you can see how long it takes how much

00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,530
data you get on the first on the second

00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:21,020
request so you can see if things are

00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:24,920
being cut properly and of course the web

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,360
page test and this is how I know imagine

00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,090
me like a haven't really sled Matt

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,860
imagine if it's hard but the truth is

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,260
I'm writing software is hard no one told

00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:36,590
you this was like funny what do you is

00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:38,900
funny but it's her um but at least we'd

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,870
have to build the browser first in

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:46,640
theory that would be very hard and and

00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:48,770
the thing again browsers are amazing we

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,559
have a Helen in turn this this summer

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,870
and he was implementing a feature in

00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:56,840
several he was like service a browser i

00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,670
feels like it's amazing like he was just

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,980
implementing double-click but just like

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,870
we get this kind of like interactions

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,790
that we don't even think about what

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:08,360
process do so many things for you really

00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:11,360
and with Pleakley ignore them for some

00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,100
reason and the list of features is just

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,950
growing and growing like all the cool

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,020
CSS features have been discussing today

00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,820
like all the ligatures of the grill on

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,860
flex layout we can do so many great

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,890
things and we can be so innovative on

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,809
the web and have all this freedom like

00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:30,290
when i started to web development we

00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:32,480
have to take images of custom phones and

00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:36,110
slice them and i like them in a table

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,309
and use n & mm BSP elements and take

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,710
that I we don't need to do any that

00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:43,510
anymore you can be really semantics and

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:46,370
very clear on what we mean this is great

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:49,340
we have things like offline support so

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,170
you can turn any website and I think

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,120
that works offline so you don't need to

00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,580
suffer with like roaming and things just

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,340
your the directions to your hotel are

00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,630
already in your phone sort of school you

00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,309
can engage people with push

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,280
notifications with service workers as

00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:06,860
well you can even install the app if you

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,710
really are very engaged with this

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:12,200
website and with this website because

00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:14,000
all this is built on top of a website so

00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,690
what that means is because the way of

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,490
brands

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,830
work if they understand these things

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,930
they are going to offer this option to

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,240
you if they don't they are still a

00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,070
website and they still work so when I

00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,110
hear people saying I'm just not going to

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:31,100
support Safari safaris in Hawaii I'm

00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:32,870
like are you crazy like what about all

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,190
the iphones and like oh they do super

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,050
service workers back but but that

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:39,590
doesn't mean that you have to make your

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,850
appt up dependent on just service

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,470
workers like you can still have a

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,080
website it just won't work offline

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:49,190
because you know Safari but the rest

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,690
should work so that's that's the thing I

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,340
want to like converted a like if you

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,560
build a website you can add more

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,960
features on top and it's not like an all

00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,840
of nothing like it is with apps like if

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,310
I make an Android app it's either you

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,750
have an android phone or you don't have

00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:08,300
it you can use this up or if then I

00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:12,530
phone comes with a new version of a kind

00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:15,830
of hybrid between hi phone and what's

00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:17,930
the other thing ipad and then you have

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,480
to build a version of the app for Daniel

00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:23,030
saying that's ridiculous but with a

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,840
website to just get one thing that works

00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:28,400
everywhere and it's like it's totally

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,350
mind-blowing and I don't understand how

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,460
people are so keen on using steel apps

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,930
when you have all these great things so

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,290
it's exciting times the via web

00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:42,020
developer and the thing again is that we

00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,610
can reach so many people like I don't

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,380
even know how many people in on earth

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,850
but there is so many people that already

00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,280
connected to the Internet and the

00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,290
millions of a common new internet users

00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,850
they are actually not using iPads they

00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,980
are not using iPhones and they are using

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,990
and reader they are using like I mean

00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,120
those fancy androids there is like cheap

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,280
android phones and they have like small

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,850
data plans and they don't want to

00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:08,210
install app they just want to have their

00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,560
photos and you know like access websites

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,890
because it just don't have a space

00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,360
they're really cheap phones so I'm the

00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,100
only important thing is that the process

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,000
they are using you haven't even heard

00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,230
them before because they're like totally

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,320
custom things that the couriers are

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:26,290
building and things like like UC browser

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,520
which I've never do this because

00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:32,020
a bad developer so that's it whole thing

00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,330
like if you build in a way that your

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,130
prepare for the unknown you are safe if

00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,750
you're trying to just use things that

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:42,070
you control that you're familiar with

00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:45,610
your like set for failure and i say i

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:47,440
work at mozilla we love the web so we're

00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,690
researching exploring the feature of the

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,030
web one of the things we're working on

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,640
is server which is a new browser it's

00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:57,310
parallel say from performant as a new

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,960
browser engine is Britain in rust the

00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:01,180
holidays because it's written in rust

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,990
it's a very safe language so if there is

00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:06,880
a crash which is prayer user data should

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,950
not be put in the insurance so people

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,570
cannot steal your back credentials and

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,120
things like that and the other cool

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:15,910
aspect of rest is that is very parallel

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,310
by default so we are trying to make sure

00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:21,850
that we are using all the of the

00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:25,810
hardware in mobile browsers which means

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:29,500
that so mobile browsers have more course

00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,970
but each course is lower so normal kind

00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,770
of like traditional browsers are

00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,480
designed for mono Corps maybe a graphics

00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,460
card and the problem is that that's not

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,260
very efficient in mobile browsers so

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,420
with several we're trying to build a new

00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,130
thing from the ground up that uses all

00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,870
the course in phones and it's way more

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,690
efficient because you can use things in

00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:49,210
parallel so we can do things like web

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,490
render which is a new CSS engine that

00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:53,680
makes things like which for this you can

00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,210
use left and you can just stop and there

00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,970
is no performance issue with that it's

00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:00,340
amazing you don't need to be thinking

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,920
about oh I need to use translate instead

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:05,020
of left because left is not going to be

00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,640
fast enough so with web render you can

00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,530
ignore the thing and the other good

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,150
thing we're doing is we're taking things

00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,880
from said well I'm moving them into

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:15,340
Firefox so we can have like the feature

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,410
in the present so we're probably

00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,620
starting with some parts of the URL

00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:23,260
parsing which is a huge factor for

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:26,230
attacks like there are many good level

00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,760
never abilities that are due to during

00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,520
parsing so we're taking things like that

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,240
web render is possibly one of the things

00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,100
that is coming to the Firefox soon

00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,930
because obviously we want to make CSS as

00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,659
fast as possible so you and even need to

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,979
one there

00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:45,049
is going to be bad or slow we want

00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:47,359
people to just bright normal CSS is

00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:49,609
having to think about what the browser

00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,340
has to do to render this thing is it

00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:54,200
going to be bad as you can to be slow

00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,820
and more things that don't make any

00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,789
sense in this conference because this is

00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,379
a purely JavaScript sub thanks and I'll

00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:02,629
be around probably having more coffee

00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:06,879
because I'm like starting to feel

00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:10,999
strange I think I've been really fast

00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:13,729
but not sure time is very elastic from

00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:17,899
me right now all right thank you sort of

00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:20,330
that it's a very great talk about making

00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:22,669
websites and not applications and just

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,960
reminding all of us not to ignore all

00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:27,529
the different things that we have in our

00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:30,229
browsers and skip to the app and feel

00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:31,999
that it's all the best thing out the

00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:34,489
process still the best and by the way

00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:42,649
how many CSS developers here give me a

00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:46,999
raise of your hands CSS FTW all right

00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:51,799
I'm before any questions for some of

00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:54,830
that I shall take the money and run the

00:29:51,799 --> 00:30:01,159
round if you have any questions come on

00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:04,940
come on all right I see someone's

00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:07,249
scratching ahead all right all right so

00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,619
if there are no questions I'll have one

00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:12,379
question to up oh okay all right there's

00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:15,639
so many things in browsers nowadays like

00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:19,609
just like so much force taking right now

00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:21,379
so how do you even begin learning of

00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:24,649
this stuff like what would be a proper

00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:26,989
roadmap for someone who is new to the

00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:29,629
web different browsers how will you

00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:32,149
recommend for us to learn all the stuff

00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:33,590
out there is a very good question and I

00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:37,759
would like to know how to answer the

00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:41,720
property we have the Mozilla developer

00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:44,149
Network which is the documentation site

00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,879
we are trying to write guides for

00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:48,620
developers who are new because most of

00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:52,130
the content they can find em

00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:54,650
how to write xml is from the 90s or the

00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,930
2000s and it's like it doesn't really

00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:59,780
have good practices anymore so we're

00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:02,500
trying to write new guides which are

00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,820
more like more than worth development I

00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,880
think someone told me that code Academy

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,350
was really great for them but my problem

00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,850
is that i started doing web development

00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:16,880
in 1996 so I'm like I know it's natural

00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:19,070
to me so yeah maybe I should just speak

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,600
to more beginners so I can understand

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,990
that paint better but yeah we're trying

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:27,250
in developer mozilla org she'll have

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,250
content for beginners

00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,730
