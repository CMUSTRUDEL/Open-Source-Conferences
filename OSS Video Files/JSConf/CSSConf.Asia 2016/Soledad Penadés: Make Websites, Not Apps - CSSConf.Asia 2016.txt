Title: Soledad Penad√©s: Make Websites, Not Apps - CSSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-04
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	Is there any point in building mobile websites when Android is pretty much the market leader in mobile? Has the web lost the battle to native apps? Should we just give up and write everything in React Native? Does progressive enhancement even make sense at all? And what about CSS - does anyone understand it? Is there any point in learning HTML in 2016?
In this talk, we will get answers to these and many more questions that we ask ourselves on a daily basis (even if we won't admit to it). You will leave reinvigorated, full of optimism and pride in your craft.
100% guaranteed.

Sole has been building real time stuff for longer than she can remember.
She works at Mozilla, helping making the Web the best platform (in general) and the best platform for realtime (in particular).
She writes demos to test and spread awareness about new features, often involving Web Audio, WebGL, GIFs and/or cats.
In the process she breaks various browsers and reports an unspeakable number of strange edge cases, all in pursuit of a robust platform that is a joy to develop for.
