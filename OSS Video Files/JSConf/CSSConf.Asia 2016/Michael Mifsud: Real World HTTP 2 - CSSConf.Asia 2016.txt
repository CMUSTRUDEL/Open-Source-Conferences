Title: Michael Mifsud: Real World HTTP 2 - CSSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-15
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	HTTP/2 has rightfully garnered a lot of interest from the web performance community. For better or worse, the story of HTTP/2 has become tied to notions of free performance and how it will make "everything we know about web performance wrong".
The reality of HTTP/2 can sometimes be sobering. My talk will aim to highlight some rarely talked about caveats, in the hopes of bringing some balance to the HTTP/2 discussion.

Michael is a performance engineer at 99designs focusing primarily on frontend architecture, tooling, and site performance.
An advocate for open source software he's currently the project lead for Node Sass and a core contributor to LibSass.
He's also heavily involved in the local developer community as part of the CSSConf AU and the MelbCSS meetup organising teams.
