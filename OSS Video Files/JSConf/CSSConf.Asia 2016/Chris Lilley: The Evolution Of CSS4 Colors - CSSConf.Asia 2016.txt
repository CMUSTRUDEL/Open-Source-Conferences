Title: Chris Lilley: The Evolution Of CSS4 Colors - CSSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-09
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	After attending this talk you will understand that color is a measurable, reproducible sensation; standardized since 1931! You will get white point adaptation. You will understand Lab color space, be comfortable with gamut volume plots, and be able to laugh at snake-oil claims about color gamut coverage in advertising. You will be really looking forward to seeing CSS4 Color implemented in all the browsers.

Chris Lilley is a Technical Director at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Considered “the father of SVG”, he also co-authored PNG, was co-editor of CSS2, chaired the group that developed @font-face, and co-developed WOFF. Ex Technical Architecture Group. Chris is still trying to get Color Management on the Web, sigh. Currently working on CSS levels 3/4/5 (no, really), Web Audio, and WOFF2.
