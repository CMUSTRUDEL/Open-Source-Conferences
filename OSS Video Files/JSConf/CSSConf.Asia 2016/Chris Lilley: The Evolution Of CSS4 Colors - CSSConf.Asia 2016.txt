Title: Chris Lilley: The Evolution Of CSS4 Colors - CSSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-09
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	After attending this talk you will understand that color is a measurable, reproducible sensation; standardized since 1931! You will get white point adaptation. You will understand Lab color space, be comfortable with gamut volume plots, and be able to laugh at snake-oil claims about color gamut coverage in advertising. You will be really looking forward to seeing CSS4 Color implemented in all the browsers.

Chris Lilley is a Technical Director at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Considered “the father of SVG”, he also co-authored PNG, was co-editor of CSS2, chaired the group that developed @font-face, and co-developed WOFF. Ex Technical Architecture Group. Chris is still trying to get Color Management on the Web, sigh. Currently working on CSS levels 3/4/5 (no, really), Web Audio, and WOFF2.

	00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,080
okay so I've just been introduced

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,880
apparently now knew who I am so I can

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,120
skip over that part the talk and as you

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,610
can see it's about color CSS for color

00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,800
css3 color is what you already use its

00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,360
boring stuff well I was co-editor of

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,490
that too but you will know about that so

00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,489
that's boring so that's me we already

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,929
established that and that and that and

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:38,850
that only that but the the CSS for color

00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:40,170
part that's the interesting thing that's

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,179
what I'm here to talk to you about today

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,999
actually i lied i'm not going to talk

00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,379
about CSS for color except for like one

00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:49,159
minute at the beginning and two minutes

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,620
at the end because here's the problem

00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:55,920
okay this is what we have in CSS for

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,589
color as you can see we have kurma here

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,719
a hue angle here we've got a full back

00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:03,510
color and an alpha right understood i

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,220
can just stop now right yeah the thing

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,680
is you can look at that you can see what

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,010
the syntax is what you don't know is

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,590
what does it mean Chris why would I ever

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,680
want to do this so what this talk is

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,620
actually going to be about firstly some

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,380
basics of our color then we're going to

00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,240
talk about how you measure color then

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,100
they're going to talk about CIA la b

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,720
which is the cool thing that i'm telling

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,000
you about that you'll understand why you

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,610
want it once you've seen it then i'm

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,340
going to talk about displays and print

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,770
does anyone here well ok everyone who

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,960
uses CSS you will use CSS for websites

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,560
does anyone here use CSS for printed

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,510
material as well a couple yes ok good

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,880
well I'll talk about that briefly and

00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,220
then lastly as I said we'll get onto the

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,620
CSS for color where I show the relevance

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:57,050
all of this stuff so the first thing

00:01:52,620 --> 00:02:02,490
what is that what is this device here a

00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:04,380
prison right what does a prison do we do

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,340
flex light and what's the results of

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,019
that it makes a rainbow right it makes a

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,710
rainbow ok so we've already established

00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,880
that you already know all about

00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,980
light you know that it's made of

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,480
different wavelengths and that they go

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,130
through glass at different speeds and

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,800
therefore you can turn white light into

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,690
a rainbow and the white light actually

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,370
consisted of all those colors originally

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,080
so this is good we already know

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,520
something light is the range of

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,750
wavelengths visible to humans I

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,790
mentioned humans because like if you're

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,470
a bumblebee you can see some ultraviolet

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,330
and if you're a snake you can see some

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,790
infrared and so on so there's nothing

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,670
specific about those colors those colors

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,820
don't exist in nature those colors exist

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:50,500
in our brain in our eyes it's a human

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,790
colors as a human response or at least

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,530
the colors that we care about we don't

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,570
actually know much about bumble bees and

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,780
snakes and how they feel about color so

00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,120
here is a rainbow don't worry about the

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,880
numbers but it's roughly 380 nanometers

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,530
to 700 nanometers that's the range of

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,600
wavelengths that we can see and as you

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,800
can see we got all the other colors in

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,210
between so that's the visible spectrum

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,860
the next thing we need to know is you

00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,810
you have to don't worry about all the

00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,970
labeling here there's only one thing you

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,010
need to know about which is the retina

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,990
which is this set of nerve cells at the

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,340
back the rest of it you can just assume

00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,880
it works and for the purpose of this

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:31,860
talk that's it so what's the retina made

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,780
of well it's made out of these cells

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,940
these cells and these cells and these

00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,920
cells and then a big black layer at the

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,750
back which basically stops that like

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,370
okay the light comes in from here this

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,410
way due to do goes through all this

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,240
wiring who designed this stuff goes

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,340
through all this wiring and then hits a

00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,360
black layer there which it gets absorbed

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,460
and we've got rods which look roughly

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,380
rod-like and cones which someone in a

00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:00,220
fit of imagination looking through a

00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,450
microscope decided with conical ish and

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,820
then you can see that they have

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,830
basically connections to these pink

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,810
cells this one is connected just three

00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,780
of them and this one's connected to one

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,900
and etc and there's also these blue ones

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,280
which connect groups up laterally so

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,320
there's basically think of this as a

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,350
circuit there's lots of things happening

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,130
here even before we go on these these

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,390
these from the optic nerve these

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,240
out the back of your eye and go after

00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:28,430
your brain so even before the signals

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,410
have left the I lots of stuff has

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,560
happened to them it's actually really

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,030
complicated there's groups Sarah was

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,710
talking about animation said that our

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,350
human visual system is particularly good

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,960
at detecting motion it is the parts on

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,820
the outsides of our I a really good at

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,580
detecting motion really poor at

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,980
detecting color the bit in the middle is

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,200
actually it tends to average things over

00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,330
time so you don't notice changes fast

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,700
but you really precise on little color

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,220
shifts so we have two completely

00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,350
different visual systems which we use in

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:04,400
tandem to build a mental model in our

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:07,250
head of what the world is okay great

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,020
that's fun so let's have a look there

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,990
are three different types of cones and

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,460
if you read a bag textbook they'll tell

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,660
you they're called red green and blue

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,850
cones no they are not here is the three

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,210
cones and you can see that this one has

00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:25,580
its maximum response in yellow this one

00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:28,730
in yellow green and this one in bluish

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,460
violet so we'll call them LMK and s or

00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,810
long medium and short wavelengths you

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,510
can also see that these two are pretty

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,420
much the same and this one hardly does

00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,540
anything at all so let's look at that on

00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,100
a logarithmic scale now we can see much

00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:47,510
more yeah these two are definitely

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,930
almost the same and now if you were

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,310
building a system if you're building a

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,200
piece of electronics to measure light

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,580
you would never design it like this

00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,260
right these two you could probably

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,550
replace that with just one sensor course

00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,670
they're almost the same you would have

00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,740
you would have nice sauce bandpass

00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:07,220
functions like this to keep nice no our

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,750
eyes on like that at all this one in

00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,160
fact all of these three cells have

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,060
evolved from the same cell they've just

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,500
diverged and got different sensitivities

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,120
so we now know that we have these and

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,220
these do not give us a red green in the

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,470
blue they're giving us these sorts of

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:27,290
strange values then all of that

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,580
information goes off to the brain to

00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,780
this bit of the bat actually goes

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,030
through a bit here in the middle which I

00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,560
missed out I never mind that the lateral

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,360
geniculate nucleus and then we goes to

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,979
the human visual cortex over there

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,430
where it we get this entire visual

00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:42,139
processing happening going on so let's

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,490
go back from all the complicated things

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,800
to stuff that you already know about

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,710
color now what I want you to do is you

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,169
see the black dots in the middle there

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,969
and we need to look at that try not to

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:56,020
let your eyes move and I want you to

00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:58,430
look at that for about 15 or 20 seconds

00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:01,490
just keep looking at it don't let your I

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:12,379
track around just keep fixing looking at

00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:17,479
that same black dot 15 20 ish do you see

00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:19,550
anything green right that's weird that's

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,740
a white slide completely white slide

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,379
with the dot let's do that one again Oh

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:27,110
different colors time so look at the

00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:35,319
black dot trinocular eyes move just keep

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:35,319
looking at the black dot 10 seconds 15

00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:46,370
20 oh yes so these are called opponent

00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:49,639
colors why are we seeing this what

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,199
actually happened is the the rods that

00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,300
sort of the cones in your eyes use a

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,960
particular pigment which absorbs light

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,060
and over time if it keeps getting the

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,370
same input it kind of bleaches out he

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,409
gets tired and then if I suddenly switch

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,270
to white you'll see basically the

00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:07,460
inverse of that you'll see the opponent

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,810
thing what this tells us is that all

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,060
those nerves what they're doing is

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,740
they're producing opponent colors colors

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,939
which are opposites of each other and

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,069
we're very good at detecting changes

00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:19,639
where something changes to its opposite

00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:23,270
color and you'll see the relevance of

00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,789
this later on when I get onto la be next

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:31,759
thing you need to know what what color

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:34,370
is this yellow right it's a piece of

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,829
white paper which I took a photograph of

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,599
in a hotel room but I switched off the

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:40,909
auto white balancing on the camera so it

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,409
came out as yellow and if I have to do

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,510
the same thing outside it would come out

00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,450
as light blue but if you are with me in

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,980
the room looking

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:53,460
that you and I look at it and say this

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:55,050
is white why because we evolved to be in

00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,960
a constantly changing visual environment

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,490
the Sun goes behind a cloud and it takes

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,410
the light level down and it changes the

00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,270
color balance and none of that is

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,710
relevant our eyes will just filter that

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,660
out and we will just see the scene as

00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,820
having shifted slightly not all the

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,580
colors changed right so our eyes are

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,410
constantly doing white balancing we

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,990
adapt to whatever we think is the

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:20,300
brightest most white like white and all

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:22,500
the other colors shift to adapt to that

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,390
and if you don't do that then you get

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,100
things like this where people have wars

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:32,100
on the internet about exactly what color

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:34,460
dress was okay so color what we now know

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,770
about color is it's a subjective

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,660
sensation in the human brain and it's

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,640
caused by visible light acting on the

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,960
human eye and then been going through a

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,820
whole bunch of layers of neural

00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,020
processing okay that's a great

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,810
definition that tells us about color

00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,850
what how what can we do with this I mean

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,170
it's really complicated now if we want

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,970
to know what a color is we're going to

00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,430
have to measure how bright it is every

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,810
different wavelength like a spectrum and

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,430
then we're going to have to have

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,320
electrodes in the brain and measure all

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,940
the impulses from all the nerves and put

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,430
it all together and it's going to be

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,580
really complicated and we can't possibly

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,590
do this actually we can it turns out to

00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,540
be simpler than that simpler than you

00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:18,120
might think we can treat the entire

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,190
visual system as a black box we can say

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,410
here's the input tell us what the

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:26,850
outputs are like and we can build a

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:28,170
model from that so next stage imagine

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,840
that was all basics that was all the

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,660
easy simple stuff whoo-hoo so a

00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,370
measurement you want to measure color

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,140
let's start off with this as a spectrum

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,320
this is a graph of how bright a

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,690
particular thing is at all the different

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,220
wavelengths from read through to violet

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,290
and you can see this has got all these

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,110
peaks so from that you can tell what

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,960
color it is right and these guesses what

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,700
color it is I couldn't tell you frankly

00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,040
looking at this this is actually white

00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:00,550
it's it's a light bulb

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,610
um from that you can't tell you can't

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,709
tell at all and you can have a totally

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,690
different spectrum also looks white or

00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:09,430
green or whatever the color it was just

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,220
the spectrum alone doesn't tell you what

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,670
color it is what can we do about this

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,339
well looking at that graph we can see

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:21,009
that we actually know that brightness

00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,500
responds like this if in the greens and

00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:26,230
yellows we see a lot we see those colors

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,910
as very bright enough here in Reds we

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,920
see it as very dark and the same for

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,500
blues and violets so we already know

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,240
this this is one response that our I

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,490
producers and in fact there is a channel

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,560
coming out of our I into the brain which

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,870
is basically how light or dark is in a

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,230
particular area that we're looking at so

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,790
that's one thing remember I showed you

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,050
these cone responses so you can see

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,190
where that graph comes from it's

00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:55,810
basically you just add them up together

00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:58,660
good well I've gone back why did you do

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,730
that it's gone right back 20 tell me

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:06,310
that I'm not in a loop please don't let

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:09,190
me be in the loop yes good okay so a

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:12,430
visual matching and you can have

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,500
different spectral things and they look

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,329
the same even though the spectra are

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,510
different and we can use this to our

00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:21,790
advantage so here's an experiment this

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,010
was done in the 1930s so what we have is

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,730
two grand glass blocks and a person

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,829
looking and on this side we have three

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,190
lights this one is 700 nanometers so

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:35,800
it's a dark red and this one is 546 so

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,139
it's a yellow green and this one's 430

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,490
so it's like a violet color these are

00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:41,230
actually made with mercury vapor lamps

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,600
so they could do the same experiment in

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,939
different laboratories and always get

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,010
the same result and on this side we have

00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:50,170
the mystery light which is actually a

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,569
diffraction grating you've got you make

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,670
a rainbow you take one tiny slice of the

00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:56,050
rainbow you shown that and then you say

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,029
to them they've got three knobs or

00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,579
sliders whatever and you say match that

00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:02,579
match that color keep moving these until

00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:05,260
you get the same color on both sides and

00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,850
then you do it again for a different

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,200
wavelength and so on and so on and you

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,270
have subjects who have an awful

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:17,460
patience because they have to do 700 of

00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:20,830
these experiments to get the result so

00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,540
you'll notice I've also got another set

00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,030
of these lights on this side why is that

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,460
it turns out that sometimes for some

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,830
colors you could not match them at all

00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,620
right you've got red turned all the way

00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:36,190
down and you really wanted to make it

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,960
less red than that and the way you do it

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,670
is you cheat you put the colors on the

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,650
other side and you make the color trying

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,870
to match more red until it matches

00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:47,350
that's fine that's just a negative

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:49,300
number negative numbers aren't very

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,160
popular in 1930s because they're doing

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,600
all their mouth on slide rules and they

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,700
don't want that so they've got this

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,190
table of how to match with these three

00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,860
particular weird lamps and they convert

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,810
it to something called XYZ cie is just

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,780
that the organization that did these

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:06,850
experiments but ok XYZ gives you three

00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,650
numbers and if two colors have the same

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,220
XY said value they will look the same

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:14,410
they will be the same color to you so it

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,120
gets rid of the negative numbers also

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,410
why is the luminance that was the graph

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,180
I showed you how bright particular

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,790
colors look so it gives you the

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,620
luminance straight away it's also an

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,880
additive color space what do I mean by

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,590
that if you have well that's actually we

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,450
do have there's a yellow light shining

00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,100
there and there's a purple light shining

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,660
there and if Martin was here he could

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,580
make these moving together so they

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,130
merged on the stage producer cover and

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,350
if I have the X Y Z value of that light

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,970
and that light and added them together

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,230
it would tell me the color of the

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,910
mixture will appear in the middle I

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,190
could actually predict it you can do

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:53,080
math with XYZ and get the right result

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:54,700
so that's cool that's useful there's

00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,670
some problems that exercise it here is a

00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,430
graph of luminance from whatever it is a

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:02,110
hundred 20 and you can see that mid gray

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,610
is a way over there which is not very

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,920
handy because it would be kind of useful

00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:09,510
if it was in the middle so luminance is

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,510
not what we call perceptually uniform

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,820
another thing with XYZ is that white

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,500
adaptation isn't handled remember I

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,180
showed you the piece of white paper and

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,570
how we always see it as white even if

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,040
it's a yellowish lamb

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,530
or if it's bright bluish daylight

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,330
however not only does that change white

00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,330
it changes all the other colors as well

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,980
so let's have a derived system will take

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,800
the active I said and will change it a

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,810
bit we'll take the Y component and we'll

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,970
put a bit of simple math on it so we get

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:44,270
a scale which gray is in the middle like

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,730
that there that's the plus of L from

00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:50,540
nought to 150 is right in the middle

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,970
great excellent much better than that

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,830
now we have a and B so we did these

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,310
opponent matching experiments together

00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:00,470
we and we find that this this color here

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,120
there we are that color hair if you

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,730
stare at it for a while you'll see that

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,230
color and this one this one if you stare

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,890
at it long enough you'll get that color

00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:12,440
and so on so these are the two axes for

00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:14,180
colorfulness put that together and you

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,510
have a nice 3-dimensional color space

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:21,020
with lightness going up there and a and

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:23,240
B now the trouble with that actually you

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,680
try to match the color using RGB right

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,750
you've got three sliders and you're

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,700
trying to get the color and it doesn't

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,260
really work and you like oh how do i get

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,410
actually get there fast it is difficult

00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,810
it'd be much easier if we looked at the

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,120
angle around from say the a axis and

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:41,570
just went round like that how far round

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,410
and how far out so we can take a baby

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:47,180
and just take it from take it into a

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,640
polar coordinate system like this and

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,290
then we get that that's nice so now we

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,720
have L coming out of the screen like

00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,820
this likeness and we've got Hugh as an

00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,800
angle and at this point some of you are

00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,410
thinking hang on I've seen all this

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,540
before I seen it before we've got hsl it

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,250
is exactly the same thing doesn't it you

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:08,449
got white you've got black you got an

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,339
angle you've got a saturation if any of

00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:15,199
the other noticed that if you mix up

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:17,390
blue right in hsl it has a lightness of

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,939
fifty percent and if you make such

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,260
yellow it has a lightness of fifty

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,050
percent and does the blue and the yellow

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,240
look the same whiteness to you at all no

00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:31,169
yellow is much brighter the blue is much

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,999
darker if you do that in lch

00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:35,009
then it actually corresponds to how

00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:37,559
light it looks the yellow will have a

00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:39,330
lightness of about 70 and the blue will

00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,279
have a lightness of like 30 or 20 or

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,200
something in other words it corresponds

00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:48,419
to what we see it corresponds to what we

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,909
can measure good so now you know that la

00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:53,549
B&L CH are basically the same thing one

00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:55,529
is polar one's rectangular it's actually

00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:57,179
a measured color you can get physical

00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:58,999
devices that you stick on something and

00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,230
measure the color it gives you a readout

00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:02,999
it's good so we can do that but now we

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:07,649
need to display these colors how do we

00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:09,539
do that first of all you characterize

00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:12,119
the display you measure the color of red

00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:14,309
and then of green and then a blue or

00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:19,139
separately at all the different levels

00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:21,239
for not so 255 and then you calibrate it

00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:23,249
you correct the imbalances you say okay

00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:25,379
at this value got this much lighter this

00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:27,690
one you've got this much light and you

00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:29,070
measure it so that the greys don't have

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,299
a little bit of a shifty a little bit of

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,369
shift there there are absolutely neutral

00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,989
graze all the way along and you also

00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:35,850
have a known white point whatever the

00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:37,769
white point you want to be as a

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:41,879
standardized white point you set it for

00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:43,649
that now let's talk about the gamut the

00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:45,570
gamut is not to be confused with gamma

00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:48,330
gamma is the shape of the transfer curve

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:51,720
gamut is the range the volume of colors

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,399
you can have so you've got la b and you

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,590
produce a volume there which is the

00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:57,119
range of colors a tiny one will not be

00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,220
able to display very many colors and

00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,539
abroad one will be some fancy pro

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:05,129
monitor can display lots of colors

00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:06,359
you've probably seen this diagram by the

00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:07,950
way if you ever look at high-end

00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:09,480
monitors that will have this and I'll

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,919
have a little triangle here and it's a

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,440
this is better than this because it's

00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,700
got a big this is rubbish don't ever

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,309
trust this diagram this is a

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,379
chromaticity diagram it's a slice of XY

00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:21,149
said it is not perceptually uniform and

00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:23,239
remember I told you a perceptual uniform

00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:25,739
is the important thing so any

00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:27,659
calculations you do on this space will

00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:32,460
not give you correct answers ignore that

00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:34,769
instead what you want is that that's a

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,869
three-dimensional shape which I'm going

00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:40,190
to try to manipulate using this model so

00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:46,379
let's see can we do this

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:49,649
okay so this is the gamut of srgb we've

00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:52,739
got the a and B axes there and then

00:19:49,649 --> 00:20:01,440
we've got the white point here there we

00:19:52,739 --> 00:20:04,970
go good

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,970
next slide come on

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:21,040
sigh okay this one is a much smaller

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:24,940
gamut you can see his smaller this one

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:28,420
is a little mac macbook air and it has a

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,700
less of a gamma 2 then srgb this one is

00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:35,710
a high-end one ish unity it's got a much

00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:37,540
larger space this is a broadcast space

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,190
actually this if you go to a high-end

00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,530
cinema now and it's got digital

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,380
projection it will use this gamma it's a

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,120
thing called DCI p3 and I mentioned that

00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,530
because when we get on to CSS color

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,260
again which we will do eventually I

00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:55,480
promise you'll see that DCI p3 is one of

00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:56,940
the models you can use ok so now we need

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,670
to distinguish between device-dependent

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,440
colors and device independent so

00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,240
device-dependent is kind of what we use

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,440
we have this RGB value and it looks

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,880
different on my screen it looks

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,740
different your screen it looks different

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,809
on the projector have you ever seen

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,760
people say i'm sorry i don't know like

00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:14,440
these colors look great on my monitor

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,120
but on the projector they seem to be all

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,929
different thatthat's thatthat's

00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:22,179
device-dependent device-independent is

00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:24,190
where you say here is the measured value

00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:27,429
this is the actual color i want to

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,620
produce and then something some piece of

00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,120
software converts it to the RGB values

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,460
that's needed for the device you're

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,950
using so use instead of having the same

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,679
numbers everywhere in different colors

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,480
you have the same color everywhere and

00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:45,070
different numbers which it calculates

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,620
for you how are we doing for time we're

00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,059
okay so I'm also going to talk about

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,300
Prince a little bit because it's the

00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:54,490
same procedure does anyone know what

00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:58,780
this is this background diagram by the

00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:01,300
way G naught that is any suggestions is

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,820
anyone awake it's just that you don't

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,770
know ok that's fine that's fine this is

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,950
a dot pattern the thing is that the inks

00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:12,130
are opaque they're not transparent so if

00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:15,010
you put say cyan ink on top of the

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,570
genset ink what you see is cyan right

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,980
you just covered one up with another you

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,980
don't get a mixture they don't add

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,570
together because this is relying a lot

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,100
right

00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:27,370
sing off the paper coming into your eye

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,919
and you can't cover them up so you have

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,840
this dot pattern and you put them all

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,639
the different angles so that hopefully

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,610
they don't cover each other up too much

00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:39,730
and you make a color by changing the

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:42,250
size of the individual dots that's

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:45,220
that's the way it is so how do you do

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,690
this well first of all so remember when

00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,279
we're characterizing a screen you

00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,200
measured red and once you've done

00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:51,250
measuring red you measure green and then

00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,659
you measure blue you don't have to

00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,580
measure the combinations just the

00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:56,860
individual ones because it's additive if

00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,509
we know what red is and what green is we

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,250
can make any of the colors of mixtures

00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:02,620
because it's an additive color specks in

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,440
print it's not additive so we have to do

00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,299
all the different combinations lots and

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,059
lots of them like that we make all these

00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:12,129
patches and we measure every single one

00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:13,750
and that once you've done that once you

00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:15,399
buy a much more expensive instrument has

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,690
a robotic arm that measures more like

00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:20,399
this because it's really tedious

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:23,200
otherwise so you measure those and then

00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:25,360
what that tells you is for any given

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,879
combination of cyan magenta yellow and

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,679
black what actual color will I get and

00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:32,259
you got the measurement and the problem

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,149
we want to solve is the opposite given a

00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:36,370
particular color how much of these inks

00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:39,429
do I need which is a 4d reverse

00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:41,559
interpolation but the result is the same

00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:43,570
as on screens you've got neutral Gray's

00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,669
you were accurate colors you know how to

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:48,639
mix up any particular color as long as

00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:50,259
the device can produce it then you know

00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:51,669
what cards if it can't produce you're

00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:56,230
stuck coming you you just can't produce

00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:57,820
more than it can do and you can save all

00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,980
the data having gone to all that trouble

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:03,129
you want to save it somewhere and you

00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,960
put this thing in an icc profile icc is

00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:06,700
the international color consortium and

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,649
they are the ones that made print

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,509
actually be reasonable so that you could

00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:14,080
go to different print shops and get the

00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:18,519
same result and that data is stored in

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:22,750
either XYZ at a lab as appropriate good

00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:24,519
now finally we Gonter CSS for color and

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,350
now you'll understand when i show you

00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:29,470
this Intex you actually know what it's

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:32,590
for so first of all css3 color here we

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,400
go we've got RGB blah blah blah and on

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,930
the wide gamut screen it looks correct

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,790
because that's what you mix it up on and

00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,440
then you look on an SI b screen and it's

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:43,130
too pale because this is

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,710
device-dependent color now we can hack

00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:50,120
we can use media queries for and we can

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:52,670
say do you support DCI p3 and if you do

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,440
who use this that's really horrible you

00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,030
wouldn't ever want to do this just in

00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,580
different values so that they look the

00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:01,940
same now instead what you do is you use

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,430
lch which i already showed you the first

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,100
number in l CH is the lightness the

00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:09,560
second one is the chroma and the third

00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,260
one is the hue the angle not to 360 and

00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,970
then the browser calculates on four

00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,650
different screens you will see the same

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:20,000
color five different screens you'll see

00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:25,490
the same color there we have asked the

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,800
syntax so we've got lc8 just like that

00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,660
that's the simplest way these are all

00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,780
numbers from nought to 100 apart from

00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,760
the hue angle which is not to 360 you

00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,000
can have decimals as what no you can

00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:41,840
have as precise as you want this /

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,580
introduces the Alpha and if you have a

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,930
comer you can have a whole new color in

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,970
fact you can have several but this is a

00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:51,920
fallback so if you don't understand this

00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:53,480
syntax here's the srgb value so that's

00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,310
lch which is the easiest one to

00:25:53,480 --> 00:26:01,820
understand we've also got la b which is

00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:04,820
much the same functional notation so I

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,260
CC colors by default it's in srgb for

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,750
web compatibility that's what we've been

00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:11,330
using so far but we've got predefined

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,340
display p 3 which is a sort of a

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,410
reasonably wide gamut if you have a pro

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,680
mana so it will be wide gamut like that

00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:20,750
it will be display p 3 apple recently

00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,910
introduced some phones which are also p

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,410
3 they've got some laptops which r p3

00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,790
and imax and the sort of thing it was

00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:28,370
actually Apple that pushed us to have

00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:33,950
this in the spec so there we are that's

00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:35,390
how you do it you say what space you

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,100
using and then you give the values

00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,840
there's no commas between them because

00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,550
the CSS working group has a war on

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,230
commas at the moment we want to

00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,750
eliminate them except where they used to

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,429
have lists of alternatives so get used

00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:50,019
to that because it's going to be

00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:53,570
the challenge as the browser's cache up

00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:55,639
rec 2020 by the way is a huge ultra wide

00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:58,850
gamut thing that was designed for 4k and

00:26:55,639 --> 00:27:00,590
NK television it displays almost all the

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,149
visual colors you're not going to see

00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,980
one of those displays for a long time

00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:06,679
but you can actually use it you can

00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:11,240
specify colors in it in CSS for color as

00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:12,860
well and media queries for as i

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,570
mentioned can check for support so you

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,249
can basically say I've do I have a wide

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,200
gamut monitor because otherwise I won't

00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:19,759
bother I'll just here srgb but if you

00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,049
have got it great i'll send you the

00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:25,669
other stuff instead and lastly CMYK if

00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,889
you're doing a style sheet for prints is

00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:29,149
how you will do it you have an appt rule

00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:32,419
here the same sort of thing as at

00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:35,029
font-face but in this case it points to

00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:37,460
a color profile on icc profile and then

00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:40,309
you can just use it so i give it a name

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,879
foo and then i say foo and here's the

00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:48,110
values in this forum CMYK that's it and

00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:50,600
that's device-independent CMYK actually

00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:54,350
so again you can send that to different

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:57,230
printers and it will understand it great

00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:00,950
so this is all interesting can you use

00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:02,450
it no no you cannot i'm telling you

00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,610
about something because it's going to be

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,840
important in the future and because i

00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,940
have been trying for years to actually

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,889
get it into the browser's it's not in

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,990
the browser's yet well okay i lied it's

00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:14,029
in Safari nightly now some of it is

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,740
starting to get there Google are also

00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:20,330
interested in some of it is shipping

00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:22,759
it's been weird because for like the

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,200
last 10 years all of the major desktop

00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:26,720
operating systems have shipped with

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,649
color management enabled as part of the

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,480
OS and I was like great can get can we

00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:34,369
get it in the browser now a bit too soon

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,529
not yet his kind of specialized nobody

00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:39,559
really wants it but now with these wide

00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:41,330
gamut screens people do want it but then

00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:43,129
before that happened mobile happened and

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,539
so as suddenly everyone had a little

00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:47,419
device this big and did it have color

00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:50,419
management on it no no it didn't haha

00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:51,559
but now it does now it does the newest

00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:53,659
version of

00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:57,409
I OS does in fact have color management

00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:58,940
and the new versions of Android which

00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:00,860
they haven't shipped yet but they tell

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,269
me they're going to will also have color

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,309
management so we're back in the

00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:06,559
situation of the OS supports it is just

00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:10,879
a case of having syntax in CSS to let us

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,679
use this feature the first working draft

00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:14,840
of this was only in July so it's fairly

00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,059
early days all of the specs by the way

00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,220
from CSS working group are now on github

00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:20,840
so you can look at the spec you can see

00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,999
the latest edits as soon as an editor

00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,830
checks in an edit you can look at it you

00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:26,419
can look at issues you can add your

00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,860
comments on them you can file a new

00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:30,259
issue for something in the specter you

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,519
don't understand file an issue say why

00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:33,529
is it like this why isn't it like that

00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,149
people will talk to you it's much more

00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:39,110
open now it's a very good way to help

00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:40,820
specification development and that's

00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,100
basically it these slides are online on

00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,990
my github the spec itself as I mentioned

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,850
is also on github and they also wrote

00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,350
some code in JavaScript that does some

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,320
of the color conversion so you can see

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:54,340
how that works that's it I'm done

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,340
