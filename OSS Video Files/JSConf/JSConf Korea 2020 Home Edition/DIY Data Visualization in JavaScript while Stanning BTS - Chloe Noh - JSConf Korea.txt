Title: DIY Data Visualization in JavaScript while Stanning BTS - Chloe Noh - JSConf Korea
Publication date: 2020-10-16
Playlist: JSConf Korea 2020 Home Edition
Description: 
	Here is a story of how I did my due diligence as an ARMY through data visualization. As long as you have an idea about what you want to show, you can use JavaScript to collect and visualize data! I will share with you the process of data visualization, from selecting the main subjects and key indices for storytelling, to choosing the right type of visualization charts. It's easy to create one chart, but how could you tell it's a good chart? I'll share some tips to answer this question as well. I'm thrilled to share what I learned with you, because learning and growing is way more fun together than alone!

Hi, Everyone from JSConf Korea

00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:20,632
I am here to do a presentation about 'DIY Data Visualization in JavaScript while Stanning BTS"

00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,853
and my name is Jiyeon Noh.

00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,251
I shall begin the presentation.

00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:29,238
The presentation will be in this order.

00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:32,594
First before I start the presentation,

00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:39,420
I want to talk about what motivated this personal project.

00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:44,051
Let me introduce myself first.

00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:45,413
Hello.

00:00:45,414 --> 00:00:48,434
I am Jiyeon Noh, the presenter, developer, and an ARMY.

00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:57,219
I was a developer working in a financial company when I was just starting out.

00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:02,058
As I kept developing for the financial sector, I began to crave for a more serious development environment,

00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:07,472
so I did Node.js back-end development in a startup company.

00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:11,252
Then I got hooked on JavaScript,

00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:15,048
so I wrote a book on JavaScript.

00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:18,834
Jaedo Koh and I wrote the book together.

00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:23,620
And now, I am working in Kakao Bank.

00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:30,032
I am a software engineer that creates visualizations for the Kakao Bank BI platform.

00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:37,629
Even though working in a company is my livelihood, and I like to work,

00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:43,636
but actually, there is another job that I like.

00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:48,070
That is, my job as a BTS ARMY.

00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:53,049
I working with those hanging on my desk during work and I get energy from it.

00:01:54,948 --> 00:02:01,841
Then I came across a question 'How could I make working more fun?'

00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:06,058
Combining what I like, which are JavaScript and BTS

00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:12,462
and what I do, which is visualization. I wanted to 'match my fan life and work life'.

00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,869
So I searched for ideas

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,241
for my personal project.

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,425
It was winter of 2017 when I first began to like BTS,

00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:32,270
and I want to talk about the song 'Tomorrow' of that time.

00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:37,038
From these lyrics, from the song Tomorrow,

00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:40,455
I was really consoled by the lyrics and empathized with them.

00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:49,269
I got curious about 'Would other ARMYs be consoled by the lyrics?'

00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,644
So I searched Twitter.

00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:56,350
The lyrics comfort my life.

00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:59,433
I am feeling frustrated these days,

00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:04,612
but the sincerity of the lyrics console me deeply, are some of the tweets I found.

00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:12,668
The second question was 'Why are we getting comfort from the lyrics?'

00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,431
So my personal project is

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,450
aiming to find what is in the lyrics on the basis of data.

00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:26,463
So began my personal project of matching my work life and fan life.

00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:32,051
First of all, the process of my project is on this page.

00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,620
I picked the topics from SNS, articles, journals, and more,

00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:45,042
and went through a data processing, which includes research, planning, collecting, and preprocessing.

00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:50,025
Then I did the analysis by SQL or keyword extraction.

00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:53,025
Next is visualization using D3,

00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:55,269
I will save the details for later.

00:03:57,542 --> 00:04:03,251
Now, I will begin explaining the process.

00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:08,076
Do you remember the topic I told you a while ago?

00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:11,399
It was 'why do people get consolation from the lyrics?'

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,445
I got it from emphatizing.

00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:19,202
As for empathizing, wouldn't it be the story the singer narrates,

00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:21,622
or the story of our own,

00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:26,444
and the sincerity that gives empathy to the fans?

00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:32,842
And many different people have their own personal stories,

00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:38,664
and there are plenty of stories that you can get empathy from,

00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:43,422
so won't it be empathy that gives consolation?

00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:47,241
Also, there is a broad emotional spectrum,

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,057
so won't there be various parts that people can feel empathy?

00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:55,635
These three thoughts were my three points,

00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:02,424
and these three points were divided into twelve indicators.

00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:07,483
Lastly, these twelves indicators

00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:09,979
and additionally

00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,026
With such thoughts,

00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:14,840
I though I could maybe prove the topics that I thought of,

00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:17,408
or through the data here,

00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:22,263
I thought, 'Can I discover new stuff that I didn't know?".

00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:27,460
So, I'll structure the data now.

00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:31,868
The data needed for the index I mentioned is the following.

00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:36,249
Information on the album's song list, lyrics, composer and the lyricist.

00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:39,297
And the storage to save these.

00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:43,445
I made the table structure in PostgreSQL.

00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,057
And I proceeded to research at the same time,

00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,557
I had Naver Vibe Music API

00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:54,259
and I brought the required data from there.

00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:58,259
I made the script here using Node.js.

00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,493
So, using Node.js, I collected the data

00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:06,457
for BTS, EXO, GOT7,

00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:11,007
and I'll tell you why I collected these three groups later.

00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:18,454
And, I did preprocessing for the collected data.

00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:20,654
I brought only the required data

00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:23,064
and fixed duplicate songs.

00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:26,856
And because the source data was local,

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:33,064
I did a process of mapping the information given by the API.

00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:39,469
And the songs had many properties.

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,460
When I analyze the lyrics, I was going to do the new releases,

00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:51,395
but because there were foreign language versions, remixes, or featuring versions, and full versions,

00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:55,831
I did a filtering on the titles of each song to classify them.

00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:01,067
Next I'm going to talk about the analysis.

00:07:01,558 --> 00:07:03,620
First, talking about the keyword analysis,

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,049
there are many open source projects that deduces keywords.

00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:15,242
Among them, I saw KR-WordRank and soynlp,

00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:21,060
but, I chose Khaiii, the open source project that extracts the morpheme.

00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:27,644
That's because, when we look at the results of keyword extraction,

00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:31,826
it eliminated the words that I thought significant.

00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:35,858
While it's right to take out the important unsorted keywords

00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:39,991
from the movie reviews or critiques

00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:45,071
when analyzing the keywords in general,

00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:49,064
the lyrics that I'm working on has short sentences

00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:53,122
and the words imply many meanings in each of them

00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:54,469
and they are well-ordered,

00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:59,867
I thought it would be a good idea to sort out the morphemes

00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:04,453
to extract the keywords that I thought were important

00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:10,454
So, Khaiii is

00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,654
the morpheme analyzer that Kakao made.

00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:17,064
First, I took a look at the comparison

00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:21,855
on koalaNLP site and chose

00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,871
an appropriate one.

00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:28,687
The method was to analyze the morphemes in new songs

00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:31,462
and extract the keywords.

00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:36,844
Not all morphemes here were appropriated so I added a user defined dictionary as well.

00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:39,717
I used only Korean.

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,261
Excluded Japanese

00:08:42,394 --> 00:08:44,474
and numbers as well.

00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:47,661
And in case of English, while they are important,

00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:53,057
due to the characteristics of K-pop lyrics, they often are repetitive

00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:54,639
in a way that they only add filer,

00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,888
so I did the keyword analysis using Korean first.

00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:05,043
And I did keyword sorting

00:09:05,974 --> 00:09:08,086
with the output morphemes,

00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:11,065
and the standard was whether they had meaning,

00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:15,650
and they have frequency.

00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:21,066
And with SQL,

00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:25,862
so, I wrote the SQL using the selected 12 indices,

00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:30,061
and I changed the data that I brought from SQL Query based on those 12 indices

00:09:30,943 --> 00:09:36,046
into the forms to be presented,

00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:39,437
and saved them as csv or json files.

00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:46,073
You can see that the extracted results are listed on the file on the lefthand side,

00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:52,048
and you can see the sample results on the righthand side.

00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:56,464
So, if you extract the data like this,

00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:02,080
you can't help but to think 'How should I present the results?'.

00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:04,260
So, I'll talk about that now.

00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:13,834
First, the result that I needed and the presentation

00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:15,445
had two needs.

00:10:15,951 --> 00:10:17,645
Let's present the data.

00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:20,035
and let’s show them the story that I'm thinking of.

00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:27,126
In fact, the reason why its called contents is not to be fancy

00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:31,757
is because you can consider videos, games, photos, and texts like this

00:10:32,118 --> 00:10:35,467
as a variety of created contents,

00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:40,337
but they have to contain information or experience to be considered as one.

00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:44,447
Therefore, I thought that the way to present these two together

00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:46,687
was visualization.

00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:52,767
As an example, to tell you why visualization is needed.

00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,217
When I visualize the index data on the left,

00:10:56,688 --> 00:11:02,527
word clouds shows the main keywords by frequency

00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,239
effectively.

00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:10,038
Therefore, I think the visualization is the one that shows the

00:11:10,408 --> 00:11:13,927
key messages in the most effective way.

00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:19,104
Then here, I was trying to think of a way to

00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:22,747
make this easy and share it quickly.

00:11:24,787 --> 00:11:27,894
This is the original way that I used.

00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,799
In fact, there are many ways to implement

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,137
and it's the matter of a choice.

00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:37,097
So, I wrote the contents like before

00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:43,574
using HTML and wrote the contents and styled it

00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:47,467
and implemented D3 using Javascript.

00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:52,437
And you can see the visualized contents on the right.

00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:58,187
But this is only shareable when you put it up on the server,

00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:01,439
It doesn't let you interact

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,497
if you take screenshots or upload pictures onto a blog.

00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:11,277
Therefore, what I was looking for was the Observable service.

00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:17,100
It's actually a service that I found while studying D3.

00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:21,759
You write down the contents using the markdown like Notion

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,907
to put the contents in a simple way

00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:29,877
and the easy file upload and library import is its key point

00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:36,560
Implement D3 using Javascript and hit the play button on the right upper corner

00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:38,227
the contents shows up right away.

00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:42,180
It's not 100% same as the Javascript,

00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:46,857
but if you are a Javascript developer, you can easily make this.

00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:54,393
So, deploy the result on the web right away

00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:58,550
and you can share it. I thought that it was its biggest strength.

00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:03,609
And if I were to mention more of its features,

00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:06,459
when I implemented the visualizations,

00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,337
I was contemplating as to how I should visualize it.

00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:15,917
At such times, there are gallery and search features in Observable

00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:20,730
I could resolve the problem by referring to many examples

00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:27,435
and because there are implementation code for them that were reusable

00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:30,967
so that it didn't take too much time to implement it.

00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:38,334
In fact, Mike Bostock of Observable also talks about this.

00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:42,837
He mentioned that the reusing is a very good method

00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:46,721
and while sharing, it is important to easily learn

00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:51,202
and to take in more information.

00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,647
So I could learn that sharing and learning are very good.

00:13:57,288 --> 00:14:00,558
Therefore, at this point, I used the Observable service

00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,787
to share the implemented contents.

00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:08,177
So I'll show you the implemented results.

00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:13,326
I'll tell you about my topic

00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:16,347
and explain by points.

00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:21,217
First, to tell you about the data sorting process,

00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:25,736
the songs that BTS have made so far,

00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:28,016
I looked at the numbers for BTS songs,

00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:34,678
and I could see 38 albums and 226 songs.

00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:40,069
Then, I took a look at how many new songs I needed to analyze the lyrics

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,147
and it was 161 songs.

00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:48,257
I took a quick look at the development of new releases by years.

00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:52,497
So I could see that they were actively making songs

00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:58,681
Next, I wanted to take a look at the answer of sincerity

00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:04,163
to question of why was I consoled by the lyrics,

00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:05,893
and how much BTS contributed in the sincerity factor

00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:11,591
So I Looked at how much BTS members contributed to the song making processes.

00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:17,203
I could see that their contribution in composing and lyrics are

00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:21,607
71% and 72% respectively.

00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:25,337
I could see that their contribution rates were pretty high

00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:29,187
looking at the contribution frequency by year

00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:30,109
and

00:15:30,603 --> 00:15:34,505
if you see the number of times each member participates

00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:36,994
you can see they are all doing it continuously.

00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:38,381
And a lot.

00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:42,903
If you see here, you can see all the members.

00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:49,174
From the members, RM participates the most.

00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:53,748
You may not realize how

00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:57,583
constant and abundant their participation is

00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:02,383
so I prepared some comparisons.

00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,873
I chose EXO and GOT7 because

00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:11,944
they made their debuts similar to BTS

00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:15,263
or have the same number of members.

00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:20,220
Like before, I categorized the songs

00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:24,077
following the debut year, EXO has the most songs

00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,304
then BTS, then GOT7.

00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:34,039
If you look at their participation

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,560
unlike BTS who had over 70%

00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:39,783
GOT7 has 20-30%

00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:44,179
and EXO has less than 10%.

00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:49,403
If you look at the amount of participation

00:16:50,004 --> 00:16:53,933
BTS' number is comparatively way higher.

00:16:54,514 --> 00:17:02,077
So through this comparison, you can know that BTS participates a lot more

00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,354
compared to other male idol groups.

00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:09,335
Of course, this all may depend on their companies

00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:14,352
and I'm not sharing this information to

00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:15,863
create a rivalry among the groups.

00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:24,134
Their participation rate and

00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:28,913
now that we looked at their genuineness towards their songs

00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,053
let's see what kind of stories they are trying to share

00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:34,723
through their lyrics.

00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:37,975
First, I tried to explain

00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:42,684
how I started this content with some photos

00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:47,968
if you look at TOP10 keywords in the lyrics

00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:50,605
our most used pronouns

00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:52,187
me, you, we, my, your

00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:55,353
are the ones in the ranking.

00:17:55,874 --> 00:18:00,158
But it's natural for these words to come up in the lyrics

00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,669
and they come up a lot

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,487
and these words decrease the frequency of

00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:10,669
other keywords so

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,743
we should just recognize how frequently they come up

00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:18,423
and exclude it from the analysis.

00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:23,903
I made a word cloud of the keywords

00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:26,953
in the lyrics.

00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,723
You can see words like

00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:34,955
love, dream, speech, world, and person exist

00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:38,793
and you can also see a lot of other words.

00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:42,970
Just seeing this word cloud felt too general

00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:45,133
so I made keywords by year.

00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:54,467
Early in their debut, members' origins

00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:58,823
such as Jeolla-do, Gyeonsang-do, Chungcheong-do, and Seoul appear.

00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:01,863
The year after that is dream and love.

00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:07,151
After that, they talk about social issues such as

00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:09,953
spine breaker and padding jacket.

00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:14,449
Just seeing up to here, I couldn't really feel

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,513
how diverse their stories were.

00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:18,803
I couldn't make any conclusion

00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:23,143
so I made comparisons again.

00:19:24,684 --> 00:19:30,394
I looked at TOP50 keywords.

00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:36,350
If you look here, the words used by BTS

00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:40,563
is similar to words used by other groups.

00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:45,313
I thought the keywords I got

00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:47,613
applied to BTS alone.

00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:51,193
But I started to wonder now that I have seen

00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:57,420
how similar the keywords are

00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:00,343
so I did some analysis below.

00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:05,353
So I did another process to really look for the diversity within the lyrics.

00:20:11,414 --> 00:20:14,103
I just had to look at BTS's stories.

00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:19,433
To look at BTS's stories, I eliminated all the keywords

00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:22,291
that overlapped with other male idol groups

00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:27,103
and ended up with 1686 keywords.

00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:30,119
Looking at those keywords

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,317
I was able to categorize them into groups

00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:35,874
so I did.

00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,629
I chose keywords that occurred more than 2~3 times.

00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:44,353
Since I'm an ARMY,

00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:47,023
if you see anything that could use some improvements, please let me know in the comments.

00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:54,523
So, the categorization that I saw with a frequency that is higher than 3 is like this.

00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:59,343
When I do it higher than two, I can see more keywords.

00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:04,173
I took a look at other categorizations with 2 or higher,

00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:08,460
and there were two things that I focused.

00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:13,767
First of all, I could tell that BTS

00:21:13,768 --> 00:21:17,023
are not reluctant to talk about themselves.

00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,972
As I said, talking about their origins,

00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:23,853
for example Seoul or Jeolla-do,

00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:26,484
or when they were teenagers prior to their debut,

00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,351
they listed the words such as

00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:32,989
cellphones, the national college entrance exams that teenagers could relate to.

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,913
With that being said, I could see that their sincerity or

00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:44,133
their participation gets higher

00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:47,043
and the second thing that I saw was

00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:50,063
that how they talked about a variety of stuff.

00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:55,190
In general, popular stories

00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:57,760
tend to contain the topics such as love, parting, and encounters,

00:21:58,044 --> 00:22:01,785
but BTS talked about keywords regarding social issues

00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:05,763
such as dependency on parents, gold spoon that tells us about the social issues of the time,

00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:14,293
and in emotional sense, rather than talking about love, troubles, partings,

00:22:14,804 --> 00:22:19,193
but they talked about anger, hope, respect, pride,

00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:23,778
or hatred, hypocrisy, they told the stories

00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:27,869
that have large spectrum of emotions.

00:22:28,384 --> 00:22:33,443
And, though I couldn't classify, because they have higher frequency,

00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:36,503
but if you take a look at the other words listed,

00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,626
they talk about artists,

00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:42,593
religious faiths,

00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:47,500
and foods, Hangang River,

00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:50,595
they talk about the stuffs that people talk about a lot

00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:56,443
while they are not mentioned often in lyrics.

00:22:57,104 --> 00:23:00,347
So, I could see that it's focused on these two things

00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:03,263
with the data,

00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:08,003
and after a proper introduction, I finished up the personal project.

00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:11,833
So, back to the topic,

00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:16,263
I'll summarize what were in the BTS' lyrics.

00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,393
Through the lyrics

00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:24,713
that BTS delivered themselves

00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:27,843
and what they weren't reluctant to say,

00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:33,583
with wide spectrum of the emotions, and that were not usually talked about in other lyrics.

00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:35,034
I think they brought out sympathy from people

00:23:35,035 --> 00:23:38,643
and consoled people through that sympathy,

00:23:38,824 --> 00:23:40,293
that's how I thought.

00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,743
So, what my project delivers is,

00:23:46,454 --> 00:23:50,933
actually, just by listening to the music, you can catch these things.

00:23:51,404 --> 00:23:57,404
But, I look at the data and create visualization contents

00:23:57,405 --> 00:24:00,063
so I think I've done quantitative analysis.

00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:04,427
Also, I think it was a process that persuaded the public about the consolation and the sympathy

00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:07,513
 that BTS offers with such analysis.

00:24:10,194 --> 00:24:12,461
To wrap up,

00:24:12,462 --> 00:24:17,761
just to tell you that what I'm going to be doing after this project,

00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:23,426
I think I'll keep studying D3.

00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:29,586
I'm looking through the official postings or other people's postings in Observable

00:24:29,587 --> 00:24:32,600
and adding tutorials one by one as well.

00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:38,748
And I also have a desire to grow the projects that I've done and add more keywords

00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:42,433
or do some emotion analysis

00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:46,893
on a sentence by sentence basis.

00:24:47,524 --> 00:24:52,246
And I'll keep on making visualizing contents on Observable

00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:53,583
and share them.

00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:58,083
This is it for the presentation.

00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,976
I'm not sure how you liked it

00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:04,486
but I‘d like to thank JS CONF

00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:07,684
for giving me this opportunity to share this,

00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:12,989
and I wish well for the people who are feeling frustrated and having a hard time due to corona.

00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:17,531
I hope to have more pleasant opportunities to share the project

00:25:17,532 --> 00:25:20,583
with other people who conduct personal projects.

00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:21,933
