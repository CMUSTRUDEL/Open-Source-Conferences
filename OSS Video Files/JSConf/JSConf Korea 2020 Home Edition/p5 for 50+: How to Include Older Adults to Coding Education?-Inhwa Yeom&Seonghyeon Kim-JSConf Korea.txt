Title: p5 for 50+: How to Include Older Adults to Coding Education?-Inhwa Yeom&Seonghyeon Kim-JSConf Korea
Publication date: 2020-10-16
Playlist: JSConf Korea 2020 Home Edition
Description: 
	“p5 for 50+” is a 2020 Processing Foundation Fellowship project. It aims to improve the digital literacy and rights of middle-aged and older adults in South Korea — with p5.js! Addressing some age-specific needs in coding education, we prototyped a low-barrier web app for learning p5.js. In this presentation, we will mainly discuss design implications for accessible education of coding.

- Hello, I'm Seonghyeon and this is 

00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,351
my fellow presenter Inhwa.

00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,184
- Hi~

00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:23,843
- we are both media artists and research assistant of KAIST

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,930
We would like to first of all thank to JSConf Korea

00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,713
for having us and everyone who are watching this video.

00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,130
Today we are very excited to talk about our project p5

00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,520
for 50+, which addresses the issues

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,700
of including order adults to coding education.

00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,700
So, the major goal or p5 for 50+ was to contribute in,

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,870
enhancing the physical, emotional

00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,520
and lingual accessibility of middle-aged and older people

00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,243
to learning coding with p5.js.

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,580
Before continuing into our presentation,

00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,550
we'd like to briefly introduce

00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,540
processing foundation fellowship program,

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,073
which supported the p5 for 50+ project.

00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,380
If you are also wished to engage in the community,

00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,270
by enhancing accessibility to creative coding,

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,330
with Processing, p5.js or ml.js,

00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,330
you might also want to consider applying

00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,800
for next year's fellowship.

00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,853
So check out the link if you're interested.

00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,890
We want to start our presentation by answering this question

00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,160
that many people would ask us.

00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,150
why creative coding education for 50+?

00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,600
Basically it started from our very personal wish

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,700
to better communicate with our parents and grandparents

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,343
about what we love to do.

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,800
And yet, if you look deeper in the Korean society,

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,120
you can notice some intertwined problems that

00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,890
our parents's and grandparents's generations are facing.

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,520
While digital interfaces and interactions consist

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,780
of substantial part of daily life in Korea.

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,390
More than half of the older population feel

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,330
as though they cannot access what has become the dominant

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,140
way of communicating with their surroundings.

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,362
Even more difficulties are found among those who went

00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:41,685
through their public and formal education before the 1970s,

00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,683
which was only the dawn of the computer education in Korea.

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,370
To cope with these circumstances,

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,840
the government has recently offered digital education

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,560
for instance, on learning computers software programs

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,600
and smartphones.

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,493
However, fewer than one percent of the welfare programs teach coding.

00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,660
Unlike the current trend of welfare policy,

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,990
we hypothesized that increasing the opportunity

00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,180
for learning coding would be particularly helpful

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,720
for older adults

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,890
in raising their confidence toward

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,453
the user interfaces and interactions.

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,290
In a way it is about learning a language

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,810
for directly communicating with a computational entity,

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,590
understanding how the Computer "thinks"

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,393
and how it responds.

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,280
In the sense, we consider p5.js

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,230
to be our perfect starter language,

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,600
especially for those unfamiliar with machines,

00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,300
because the inputs outputs processes

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,930
and entire logical flows

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,780
can be intuitively delivered

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,453
with a variety of interactions.

00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,700
In fact, 500 people from around the world,

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,480
the world also from older age group

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,920
have expressed their high interest

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,230
in learning coding for the following reasons:

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,060
One, to overcome their fear towards the digital environment.

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,800
Two, to enhance their cognitive abilities.

00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Three, to re-educate themselves for planning for their later life.

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,990
To better document the older people's actual needs

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,660
in coding education,

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,210
we interviewed 13 people

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,150
with an average age of 62.

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,520
These interviewees have commonly appeal to their interest

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
in learning new technology

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,810
and are willing to go outdoors

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,520
for learning it.

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,060
And they express their preference in learning together

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,723
with people who share similar challenges.

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,220
One thing to note about older adults demographics in Korea

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,870
is that they demonstrate high confidence

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,930
in using smartphones as well.

00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:14,510
Based on these needs-finding,

00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,930
we thought holding p5.js workshop

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,130
specifically dedicated to older adults

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,520
itself can contribute to in increasing

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,403
the learning opportunity for older population.

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,230
In fact, coding education has actively been adopted

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,507
in both public and formal,

00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:35,480
and private and informal institutions

00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,563
over the last decades in Korea.

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,770
And learning resources are getting

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,130
bountiful both online and off-line.

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,130
However, those materials and curriculums

00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,663
are not very suitable for 50+ people.

00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,150
I think Inhwa can talk more about this.

00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,730
right Inhwa?

00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,823
- Yes thank you Seonghyeon.

00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:04,250
So we started designing this workshop in consideration

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,630
of the technical access of older adults to coding devices.

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,200
Like in our formative interview,

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,770
the older adults demonstrated their confidence

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,570
and familiarity to smartphones,

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,100
so we thought we should devise a way through

00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,020
which they can access with smartphones

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,420
the p5.js learning resources.

00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,830
and also to utilize web editor without a separate

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,860
or a refreshed window

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,180
and what's even better is that

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,081
we can utilize the smartphone to learn the p5.js anytime

00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:34,660
and anywhere we want.

00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,620
And in this talk,

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,660
actually we've also planned to introduce

00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,950
our p5 for 50+ workshop,

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,520
our experiences there,

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,070
but due to the rebursting of COVID-19

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,710
unfortunately it's been delayed to late November

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,800
and yet the overview of the workshop we can see

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,160
from the current slide.

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,600
So if you're also interested in learning more about this

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,068
workshop itself and the actual voice of older adults

00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:01,750
on their experiences of learning p5.js with smartphones,

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,343
please stay tuned till then.

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,400
But before everything and in preparing for,

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,310
p5.js workshop in Korea especially

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,370
for those workshops that are targeting older adults,

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,990
the Korean translation of materials is a must.

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,850
So it is important to know that the English,

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,230
it comes as a double bind for non English speaking people

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,020
when learning coding since code is written in English

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,720
and most of the learning materials

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,480
in online forums circulate in English.

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,760
So as a part of minimizing this lingual barrier,

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,680
we translated the official website of p5.js in Korean,

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,920
so that not only our worship participants,

00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,240
but also the entire Korean speaking population can better

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,470
access to bountiful resources on this website.

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,580
Just one thing to note,

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,880
the sketch backgrounds was created by Seonghyeon

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,480
in celebration of launching Korean version of the website.

00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,910
Seonghyeon can you briefly talk about your work too?

00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,330
- Thank you Inhwa.

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,440
So the artwork is my re-interpretation

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,793
of “Hunminjeongeum” with p5.js.

00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:05,750
Hunminjeongeum means the native script

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,190
of the Korean characters and language invented and promulgated

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,040
by King Sejong in 1446.

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,540
I found much similarity between King Sejong's intention

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,540
of creating Hangul characters with the sprit of p5.js.

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,410
especially in terms of enhancing everyone's accessibility

00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,143
to lingual experiences.

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,510
- Yeah, so likewise in our project outcomes,

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,280
we try to include not only Korean,

00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,980
but also the average English and digital utilization level

00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,923
of older adults to re-adjust the learning materials.

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,160
So in that sense,

00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,630
we also thought that unlike the usual way of learning coding

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,610
p5.js can be particularly helpful in enhancing older adults

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,940
understanding of coding and multi-sensory manners.

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,400
We thought it was crucial to offer a wide variety

00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,430
of options for exploring example of sketches

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,060
with readily accessible codes through p5.js web editor.

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,140
So this way they can try out the interaction

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,600
and tweak with codes and see how the entire

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,330
process of programming works like

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,150
from their inputs to outputs.

00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,490
And if you're also looking for p5.js sketches,

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,490
you might want to explore this showcase.p5js.org

00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:25,210
Is the p5.js 2020 showcase website produced

00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,883
and curated by Connie Liu.

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,160
It introduces 60 and more p5.js projects

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,430
that are categorized under specific themes

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,080
or interactions such as data visualization,

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,003
game, sound, typography, etc.

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,460
So all of these aforementioned ideas to our project,

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,580
are capstone in this prototype,

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,560
you can access on p5 for 50+,

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,850
Like we've constantly emphasized we discovered

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,850
the strong needs for a learning interface that's specially

00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,743
designed for 50+ people.

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,610
Our interviewees demonstrated "higher confidence in using

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,290
a smartphone than desktop PCs or laptops."

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,620
So we managed to create a mobile base web application,

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,940
so that they can access p5.js materials

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,880
and the web editor simply through a single URL

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,170
on their smartphones.

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,504
Again anytime and anywhere they want

00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:21,270
and without the barrier or the burden of carrying

00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,390
around a laptop or tablet,

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,870
or without downloading an application on their phone.

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,020
In case p5.js web editor,

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,740
we embedded that in our application so that the learners

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,880
can practice coding, customize example codes

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,170
save and manage their codes without a separate

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,543
or refreshed window.

00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,020
So this prototype it's basically like a simplified version

00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,600
of p5js.org which is the official website of p5.js.

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,000
We kept the structure and design elements of p5js.org

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,830
but use less texts and bigger fonts,

00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,080
made more visual elements and interactions come to the front

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,420
and placed more focused on the basic concepts

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,370
of computer programming would hopefully

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,061
an easier user flow.

00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:09,360
The official website of p5.js is re-introduced as advanced

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,500
information through hyperlinks.

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,340
So when we propose the p5 for 50+ web application

00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,280
[we're doing so] as a stepping stone towards the official website

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,160
or any other resources that are bountiful

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,040
but text oriented.

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,240
This is to boost the age groups confidence

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,500
in self learning through smartphones.

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,180
We hope that the users feel at ease

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,080
and have fun while exploring the web application

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,650
and then eventually move on to p5js.org

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,618
or other resources or hyperlinks

00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:37,940
for more in depth knowledge

00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,870
without being overwhelmed

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,653
by the depths of it at first sight.

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,390
So in our p5 for 50+,

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,000
we'll be fully utilizing this web application

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,810
in line with analog or tangible media and contents.

00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,900
In our case we're using pen markers and color papers

00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,600
so that the participants can actually draw sketches

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,523
that they want to code later or write down codes.

00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,753
And we're printing out the code sketches in A4 size

00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:09,570
we're framing the sketches so that the participants

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,530
can have a mini exhibition

00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,970
and take away their materialized results of coding.

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,380
As we're brainstorming on their code sketches,

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,640
we're asking them to recall their personal memory

00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,390
and stories as the means to reinforce their cognition.

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,203
Such tasks included the visualization

00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:30,360
of their own writing,

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,540
the daily writing or their self portrait

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,550
of their past, present or future selves,

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,870
drawings of their beloved living creatures,

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,300
objects or a roadmap to their favorite places

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,290
and their neighborhood landscaping, etc.

00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,040
In designing the curriculum we have not only referred

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,320
to cognition reinforcement education programs

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,900
for older adults,

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,070
but also the learning methodology and materials demonstrated

00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,683
at other p5.js workshops and classes.

00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,990
So for your reference, we'd like to introduce that

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,750
you can now access information

00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,990
to p5.js workshops and classes

00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,300
and relevant teaching materials through this page

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,420
that's newly launching this September.

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,920
The URL is p5.js.org/teach

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,670
and the page was designed to document

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,360
and share p5.js teaching experiences around the world.

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,050
It's constantly receiving submissions

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,240
on the teaching cases,

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,920
so if you got any you might want to

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,773
consider sharing yours through this web page as well.

00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:29,960
As for our workshop, we have referred

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,400
to these two workshops in particular,

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,640
which you can also check out

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,010
on the teach page.

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,810
So on the left, you can see Lauren McCarthy’s workshop,

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,930
who is the very creator of p5.js and also the advisor

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,150
to our project.

00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,300
So Lauren has led the "Smarter Home" workshop

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,930
in South Korea last year,

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,990
where a fair amount of participants

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,580
were middle aged and older

00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,960
and they engaged in the two months long collaborative

00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,180
p5 projects for an exhibition.

00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,860
Her experience led us ponder more on the re-engagement

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,420
and sustainability issue of learning coding.

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,077
So to quote her

00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,410
"Teaching coding sometimes

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,060
is not about losing people,

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,660
it is about how to keep them engaged instead of scaring them away."

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,110
Now on the right side, you can see Qianqian Ye

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,798
and Evelyne Masso's workshop

00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:17,980
Qianqian was mentor to our project

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,534
and together with Evelyn she led

00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,380
a series of workshop called "Digital Weaving

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,503
physical computing".

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,970
And this workshop participants transformed their codes

00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,036
into tangible materials such as fabric.

00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:35,036
Their workshop has let us think more about how we can

00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,310
leverage tangible materials and interactions

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,140
and then to promote it in more intuitive and affectionate

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,020
way of learning coding.

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,460
So combining our research and the insight

00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,080
from our mentor and advisor,

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,240
as well as other p5 educators,

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,875
we could devised principles for designing p5 for 50+ workshops.

00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,530
So we believe a p5.js workshop can start

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:03,030
from asking the reason why participants would want

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,460
to learn coding and how the experience

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,660
can be beneficial for them.

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,780
This is not only to inform them of social

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,650
cultural functions and effects of computer programming and

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,350
the contemporary society,

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,950
but also to keep them motivated throughout the workshop.

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,890
Now keeping the learning materials and environment

00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,750
physically and emotionally accessible

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,000
is never too much to emphasize.

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,030
In our case, we've considered their physical accessibility

00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,680
to computing devices,

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,300
the lingual accessibility,

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,803
and the universal design of learning interfaces.

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,930
And these three in a row,

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,390
we can talk about it all together at once.

00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,650
So we think it's important to utilize multi-sensory elements

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,780
of p5.js sensorializing the participant's personal narratives

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,270
and then materialize the results from digital

00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,500
to analog media so that they can take away

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,230
their learning experience with a souvenir.

00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,290
We're also considering the souvenir as an

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,350
at-home device for recalling their memories of learning coding

00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,090
so that they won't forget to re-access p5for50.plus

00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,260
when they wish to continue learning.

00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,990
Once again to emphasize,

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,270
this is one common methodology actively

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,960
employed in the fields of gerontology or to studies

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,960
of the older adults or studies or rehabilitation

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,747
in terms of improving the 50+ learner s'

00:16:24,747 --> 00:16:29,470
understanding of, concentration on, and affection towards what

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,073
they are learning.

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,550
Providing a time and space for social interactions with

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,620
other people in the midst of workshops would be helpful.

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,990
By social interactions we mean those moments where

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,770
you can communicate with those people who share

00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,400
similar backgrounds,

00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,080
interests and challenges.

00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,800
or better yet with their own family members

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,400
Note that in case of Korea,

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,080
the alienation and generational gap issues are

00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,393
our biggest challenges to older adults.

00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,750
Last but not least important to note that

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,220
for educator themselves to enjoy their moments of teaching!

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,220
So let us enjoy teaching and learning from our participants!

00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,320
This is all for our presentation.

00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,030
Thank you very much for attention.

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,390
And if you have any questions,

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,180
