let's just crack on with it my name is

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,870
Thomas Wilson I work at privet ah where

00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,740
data privacy startup scale-up just based

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,120
near Black fries

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,990
and today we're going to be talking

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,549
about how we bought react.js from front

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,039
to back so how we've bought it have

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,480
we've created full stack teams at pivots

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,340
are so first of all let's chat a little

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,519
bit about me which is also my expert

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,109
subject so on twitter at TJ Wilson 92

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,670
give me a follow I'm a front-end

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,689
developer over at private I'm using

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,660
typescript and react

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,250
I'm the UX and UI design enthusiast so

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,960
we'll get to this a little bit later but

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,700
I'm really interested in this this font

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,649
of the front concept so UX engineering

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,149
is something I find really interesting

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,050
I come from an educational technology

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,020
background which will become apparent

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,579
very quickly I'm a doctrine producer for

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,039
a local content regards theater company

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,710
we're cool can outdance code I'm a

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,930
cyclist I love coffee Indian food and

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,670
loose leaf tea and I I'm a list

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,020
enthusiast that was the first of many

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,050
lists we're gonna see you tonight so

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,520
buckle up what are we going to talk

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,620
about we're gonna be having a look at

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,670
first of all working in data privacy and

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,309
how we create privacy enhancing

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,960
technologies we're going to look at how

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,790
we create a full stack team and kind of

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,290
what that means and then lastly we're

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,729
going to be looking at conversations you

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,580
should be having as kind of the more

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,840
experienced reacting JavaScript

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,549
developers if you start working with

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,159
people who are maybe a bit newer to the

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,810
community in the ecosystem I lied this

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,159
is the last point then we're gonna be

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,540
looking at some guidelines and resources

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,369
for how we have those conversations and

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,680
how we do that training so let's take a

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,659
live brief little foray into a privacy

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,750
enhancing technology for anyone heard of

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,360
privacy enhancing technologies before

00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:39,390
don't retreat that's so fun so private

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,740
privacy enhancing technologies are super

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,270
interesting for a couple of reasons so

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,270
recently there's been a whole bunch of

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,640
corporate legal and social pressure for

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,720
data privacy for you guys that don't

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,890
have don't have how many of you know

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,390
this but there's a whole bunch of data

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,880
out there floating around about you that

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,110
people know and only recently you have

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,710
ads

00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,550
companies have to kind of fess up to the

00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,720
ethically questionable things they've

00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,370
been doing with your data and so all

00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,230
this pressure of now we things like GDP

00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,430
are in Europe and America are really

00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,290
pushing this all right we've forgotten

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,670
there's a lot more awareness of where

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,990
your data is and how it's being used and

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,700
how you is the people who are the source

00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,230
of that data you have a right to

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,720
understand what that data isn't where

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,040
it's but at some point these wonderful

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,840
ethical ideas which we all agree with

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,700
have got to come down to like real

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,010
people sit in front of real computers

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,770
using it on real data unlike a Wednesday

00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,180
afternoon there's a gap there between I

00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,840
have this wonderful idea I'm a lawmaker

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,090
too

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,730
I work at a bank and I've got to make

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,200
sure my data is legally compliant and

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,140
because it's so new there's no visual

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,580
was no syntactic vocabulary that exists

00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,630
yet to explain these concepts and

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,480
they're very difficult concepts to

00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,920
explain which is why privates enhancing

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,540
technology is a really interesting area

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,130
to be working in because it's only so

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,840
briefly a little bit about private ah

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,670
I'll keep it very short so we our

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,080
enterprise software company we don't

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,150
there's no consultancy it's all

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,400
enterprise level software and we are

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,470
actively involved in the research and

00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,110
policy space so we have a lot of ties

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,220
with academia we have recently been

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,230
involved with the government writing a

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,660
chapter for and your first of National

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,890
Statistics on differential privacy which

00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,810
you can chat to me about if you want but

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,790
we're really we really really believe in

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,890
the things that we we say in the the

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,090
math behind it in the the rigor behind

00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,950
that it's not just about selling

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,110
software for us it's about really

00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,880
pushing the zero data privacy and we all

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,959
care very deeply about it so we we

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,560
understand it people we care about

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,350
anything

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,799
so that's collectively let's imagine

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,390
that we own what we are this cloud at

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,370
the top and we are a payments provider

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,890
company and we specialize in kind of

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,100
transient retailers so maybe people who

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,810
own those pop-up coffee stores or people

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,370
who own pop-up store that physical

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,989
stores and you are in these little

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,070
plastic chips you've been there I've

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,110
been there we've all seen them we've all

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,030
bought coffee with them and you as the

00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,530
cloud have a whole bunch of rows in a

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,150
database essentially about transactions

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,620
and through that we can kind of identify

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,120
individuals through their credit card

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,049
numbers obviously people might use

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,489
different credit cards at different

00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,799
points but we can probably bring in some

00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:59,510
data from other other third-party

00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,549
sources and start to get a good idea

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,360
about who owns what cards and therefore

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,800
the same card if

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,860
cards are owned by the same person and

00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,000
maybe what demographic that person's in

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,230
so there's a lot we can start to

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,610
identify by this data and therefore

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,680
there's a lot of value we can provide

00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,420
that this data so let's pretend that I

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,710
run this coffee stall and I want to know

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,380
if my customers are often returned

00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:20,060
customers or if they're new customers so

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,190
is the same person coming in at a

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,100
Tuesday to buy the same flat white at

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,780
8:33 p.m. for example or is it someone

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,010
know all the time because I can provide

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,300
a lot of value from that I can

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,400
understand how a marketing your active

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,530
consider my next market can move I look

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,760
I can look at loyalty programs it's good

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,280
for me of the business to have that data

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,460
the data privacy and the data privacy

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,440
protection here is icon ie the cloud

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,300
provider cannot to send an excel file

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,919
off with a whole bunch of roads with

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,990
with credit card numbers in that's just

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,310
incredibly unethical so it's about

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,200
understanding how that data needs to be

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,390
transformed for me to be able to provide

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,860
the right level of information from the

00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,030
data but was to protect the people at

00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,270
the root of the data which is you guys

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,500
using your credit cards to buy coffee so

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,270
that's one instance of it another more

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,530
sensitive instance is looking at

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,150
healthcare so let's imagine that we're

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,940
doing some Public Health Policy and we

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:12,530
want to look at and how Hospital Veda

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:14,390
how GP data and how some digital health

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,680
data so that straw from stick that just

00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,300
character they're not our customers

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,890
logistic samples they might collect

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,060
things that heart rate and continuously

00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,890
throughout a day or do some physical

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,050
exercise and obviously there's that's

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,210
potentially very deeply personally

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,080
invasive data to have about someone but

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,750
it's very important to my health

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,280
perspective so controlling who has

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,710
access to which part of that data was

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,210
very important understanding if a GP

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,650
doesn't need to see your past 30 days of

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,120
activity of strapper for example it's

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,350
completely irrelevant but they might

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,760
need to see if you've been Hospital in

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,880
the past 30 days that could be much more

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,590
relevant to what we're talking about so

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,000
data privacy can be about aggregating

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,110
and transforming data it can also be

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,180
just about we're stretching who has

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,700
access to what data and if I can access

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,260
it what form is in not about privates in

00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,270
health technologies let's look at the

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,370
full stack trademark teams and what it

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,020
means so when we think about the

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,390
development stack we had these wonderful

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,830
ideas about being a full stack developer

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,270
and then there was this piece about the

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,320
myth of the full stack developer and

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,610
then there was a other really great

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,830
piece called the myth of the myth of the

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,450
full stack developer and now we've got

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,590
the CEO kind of t-shaped developers and

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,450
the point I want to get here is that

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,200
people are just going to learn whatever

00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,640
they find

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,610
interesting and one that whatever lets

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,870
them get the job done some people for

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,680
some reason take a lot of pleasure in

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,820
telling you but you can't be a

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,230
full-stack developer there's no way

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,760
someone could possibly understand the

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,690
server and the client it cannot be done

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,240
it's a very interesting affinity to have

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,310
not one that I share but recently

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,690
there's been a survey of a t-shape

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,910
developer so if you're working in the

00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,170
web which can probably are hip you are

00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,120
you will have this widespread knowledge

00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,830
but you might have a bit where you get

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,870
particularly few so that might be on I

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,810
really understand SVG transformations

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,030
animations cool that's all the banks of

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,860
the team mr. d thunder it might be that

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,980
you really care about how you versus

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,150
proxy through nginx great allowing

00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,890
people to have that full stack

00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,600
understanding and pick their own area of

00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,580
expertise that helps them and help their

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,810
businesses is really important and

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,160
really interesting within the web

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,930
community are you I think it's quite

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,370
unique to us and I really celebrate that

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,690
because I love knowing a lot a little

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,090
bit about a lot it suits my personality

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,040
fact really well so having a full stack

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,770
team is really important in terms of

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,090
sharing knowledge of concepts so I am I

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,070
understand differential privacy really

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,230
well from a very conceptual standpoint

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,150
but my understanding of it remains

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,620
conceptual compared to the people the

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,080
people I work with wrote that are

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,730
Wiggins that do the transformations we

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,920
have that great level of understanding

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,060
of what should be done and how it's done

00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,610
it's a really great thing to have within

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,440
a team and it also helps remove things

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,860
like silos or tribes or them there's no

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,970
throwing work over a fence there's no

00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,160
being a bottleneck for someone else it's

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,310
working together and seeing we're all

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,260
just developers rule in this together

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,490
it was means that we were able to pick

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,260
up and just to make little changes to a

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,310
codebase here and there which is so

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,330
useful because then you're not relying

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,020
on someone you're not creating as

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:59,060
bottlenecks and like it or lump it I

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,500
like this today Java is 24 years old it

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,060
is nine months older than the junior

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,220
that started and sits opposite me

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,260
Java is a very old software bit of

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,270
software so you work the same for 24

00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,740
years and still do it that's very brave

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,970
but you also come with a whole bunch of

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,680
experience about how you actually create

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,600
enterprise software so there are systems

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,780
out there that are probably 24 years old

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,610
and I'm still running let's see if

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,970
there's anything react running in 24

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,470
years so you come with that level of

00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,540
experience you've got an idea of of

00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,640
architecture that works with ci or CV

00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,230
pipelines are more recently kind of this

00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,850
cloud of instruction services obviously

00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,220
that's a much newer development but it

00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,020
comes much more naturally to them that's

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,430
why were this sharing and this this

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,320
great progression that we've all made to

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,169
being full-stack developers guy called

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,960
Chris Collier fantastic man of CSS CSS

00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:46,730
tricks wrote this article this in

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,270
January of this year about the Great

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,400
Divide

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,870
he runs a podcast called shop talk show

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,220
he's just been speaking to a whole bunch

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,750
of web developers over the past couple

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,130
years and one of the things the themes

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,900
that he saw that kind of emerged through

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,970
this is that we have the front of the

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,580
front and the back of the front so even

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,730
if we are this t-shaped developer even

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,750
there we can find ways to aggregate

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,270
ourselves and differentiate ourselves

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,640
and divide ourselves so there's we have

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,380
this strong urge to be other to be

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,310
different to be differentiated and I

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,410
don't necessarily think that's a bad

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,580
thing it's fun at the front developers

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,920
which is why I personally kind of

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,660
identifies is understanding how we

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,370
design visual interfaces to clearly

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,320
communicate ideas it's understanding how

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,200
we communicate technical ideas it's

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,880
understanding how we let users define

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,670
the things they intended to define so if

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,810
I need to tell you the shape of my data

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,310
especially pythons that healthcare data

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,750
it's very important that that's freeform

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,770
data but I can communicate why I need to

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,190
communicate through the interface

00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,270
whereas back of the front developers are

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,410
fantastic at kind of getting the

00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,940
software to the clients and

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,460
understanding how we might manage the

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,990
software when it's behind when it's on

00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,370
premises when it's behind a firewall how

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,320
can we debug it have we manage it

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,670
sustainably how can we offense get our

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,310
API calls all these really important

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,140
things that absolutely are essential but

00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,730
I would find incredibly tedious and

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:04,010
boring to work through they absolutely

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:05,720
love I've spoken a lot about theory but

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,550
let's talk about what action means so

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,320
the point I was going to get across Luis

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,420
very well put together very well Alec

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,790
you to thoughts is that we all have very

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,690
different skills and it that's fantastic

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,700
and we should all be working together

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,580
because we as a team can move each other

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,840
forward for the benefit of the business

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,550
what does that mean for react.js and

00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,960
what does that mean for bringing on back

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,460
in developers or back of the front

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,740
developers or anyone who hasn't worked

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,080
in react yes how do we on board them

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,700
let's start to get stuck in the weeds so

00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,820
every example I'm going to give is

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,670
related to Pokemon it hasn't

00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,470
for the past a few days my history my

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,290
search history has been Pokemon things

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,000
and basic react.js questions which I

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,680
take great pride from whenever anyone

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,580
looks over me and I'm just like looking

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:50,890
at Pokemon on Wikipedia so imagine we

00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,380
are a museum and we have fun facts about

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,030
Aerodactyl we have three fun facts this

00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,980
is actually a true fun fact you can you

00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,660
can of fact check me here and we want to

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,470
let the user be able to select the fun

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,760
the fun fact that they want on when

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,230
someone comes to him for implement this

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,720
in react they might start asking mister

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,700
question why can't I set state directly

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,180
when I use a click fun fact number two

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,310
why Cannot I say that's right there are

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,020
animation why can't I say this thought

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,710
state select a fun fact ID it gives

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,400
equal to one

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:23,590
why does that not work it's very

00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,700
interesting question because it it would

00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,230
technically work in the state would

00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,540
internally update but what we wouldn't

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,130
see is a rerender because what we start

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,810
to see here is that a new object of

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,220
state isn't created which means when

00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,560
reaction was to diff the state it's

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,000
gonna return us true and it's going to

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,900
tell us it's going to say the true

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,920
things are equal when they're not equal

00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,380
it's gonna return as a false positive

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,580
and that's gonna mean it doesn't render

00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,020
cuz reacts very good at knowing when

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,610
things should or should render lapses

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,090
that's this whole thing that's what it

00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,480
does for us

00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:51,520
so getting someone who might come from a

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,200
more imperative background or more kind

00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,390
of getter setter mindset that things

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,520
like Java and c-sharp provide us this is

00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,230
a very intrinsically important thing to

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,930
understand a very intrinsically

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,220
important thing to to communicate with

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,870
the people who are coming onto our team

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,950
and sometimes it's not going to be

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,750
enough especially for experienced

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,850
developers to say just don't touch state

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,770
directly user state use use these hooks

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,530
you want to be able to explain at this

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:17,080
level let's imagine they've got another

00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:19,120
question let's say that we are making a

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,650
website for Professor Oak and it's just

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,930
a very simple sort of static site but we

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,160
want to provide some kind of analytics

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,060
so let's know when the page is rendered

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,560
because Professor Oak

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,240
really cares about people seeing his

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,490
site almost be able to count them so

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,900
let's say we've got some code super

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,850
simple code because God knows that we'll

00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,440
hook up here and love me I hope so we

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:39,430
just got this little boolean flag saying

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,690
has it loaded fun little fact about the

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,890
fire animation you can said it's gone

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,600
for 60 seconds

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,779
can you imagine ever needing a fire

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,060
animation to last a full minute Oh

00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:50,949
this surgical presentation so we've got

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:55,329
we've got this here just imagine it

00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:57,329
we've got this here and this might get a

00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:59,230
little bit of trouble because the

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:00,850
javascript in the browser kind of runs

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,310
single threaded there are edges for that

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,529
case we might end up in a case where

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,300
every render a boolean is set to a value

00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:08,709
which causes the render to run again

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,300
which causes the value to be set which

00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,740
of course it's a recursive loop that we

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,389
can easily get a cell stuck in because

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,230
we're invoking a function within the

00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:18,519
within the function component itself and

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,500
that can that's one we can start to see

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,420
our laptop try and take off that's when

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,470
we can see something start to burn up

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,480
and it might not be immediately obvious

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,860
when it is something so invisible as

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,800
setting a boolean it has loaded but it

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,420
can can causes problems and so here is

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,589
when this idea that react everything is

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,819
everything is just a function that's the

00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:35,529
direction we're moving and other core

00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:36,850
team is taking us in is this idea that

00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,410
everything is just a function that runs

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,490
and we can kind of point to a function

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,139
implication or we can point to a

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,500
function reference and react does its

00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:45,759
thing

00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,750
so taking aim know this reactor as

00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,069
developers and always front end

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,660
developers and explain this in the same

00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:51,430
look a function is just a component that

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,809
runs it just so happens to do this thing

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,009
on the Dom that doesn't matter is a

00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:56,139
function that runs that you are causing

00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:59,040
it to recursively cool itself that's

00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:01,779
gonna be a massive problem

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,430
another question that developed might

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,079
have so let's say that we want a pokemon

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,670
Academy in Viridian City and we want to

00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,620
login we want to just log in through am

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,180
just a Moodle so we've got this

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,839
beautiful designer homepage we've got a

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,939
login button and we've again we've just

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,379
got a boolean flag saying is this modal

00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:21,339
visible set modal is visible you stay

00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:22,389
great fantastic why can't I just pass a

00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:23,439
function invocation to this because

00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:25,329
that's what we do in angular I think

00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:27,279
that's what we do in view its we say on

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,420
click set modally is visible to true

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,250
because that's what we want on the click

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,720
that happens what actually happens under

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,689
the hood here and what isn't intuitive

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,519
to understand is that react is looking

00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:38,350
for what gets evaluated out that

00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,300
function so when that function runs set

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,069
as modal visible true it's going to

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,040
return this undefined so what react is

00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:46,540
saying is all click do undefined

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,879
how do i do want to find i can't do it

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,600
it's not a click and that doesn't work

00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,600
nothing's gonna happen when i click that

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,970
button so it's taking that again at the

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,410
fundamental idea of react is that

00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,790
everything as a function yes but

00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,500
sometimes we want to just have a

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,780
reference of

00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,100
I can decide when I call it it's not to

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,510
you the author to don't want to call

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,610
things I react will tell you and I want

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,790
to call them and it's that idea of

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:11,730
passing passing oh I forgot we have an

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,710
animation that we're passing control

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,750
over to reacts which leads me to my last

00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,970
question which is why is this not

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,410
imperative why can't I tell react do

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,310
these things in this order in this way

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,410
please

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,050
so let's imagine that you encounter

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,000
radio station and you have three radio

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,290
stations and whenever someone selects

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,160
the station what to listen to you you

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,540
just want to let them know what time

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,150
they started listening because maybe

00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:37,110
they really care about that last

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:39,180
animation of the day guys so good so

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,800
we've got this news effect took who

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,750
doesn't know we were using hooks by the

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,330
way am i speaking a speaking French

00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:47,220
while there was wild nods I saw at least

00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,960
a couple of knobs and hooks a pretty

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,030
cool new part of a react they're more

00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,290
declarative but the crowds of Amin we

00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,820
just tell react here's what you're going

00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,310
to do and when you're going to do it so

00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,840
in this instance we're saying when we're

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:01,950
saying look at the currently playing I

00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,690
miss Ming that there's a typo there's a

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,820
code error so what we should be doing is

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,920
say look at the start time and whenever

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,810
that change is wrong this function it

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,750
stops you having to manage that manually

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,920
set up maybe an on on event listener and

00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,420
then removing our own event Lister

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,550
browser react handles everything aside

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,470
of us everything inside of the browser

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,940
for us we're just saying do this when

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,200
this happens it's going to happen

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,810
asynchronously because your browser

00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,080
you're inherently asynchronous and part

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,430
of that control over is very difficult

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,960
it's very this is a very big conceptual

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,840
gap to make and it's one that I had a

00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,190
lot of fun explaining because it comes

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,660
very slowly because it crops up in

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,520
different places especially where we are

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,620
with the reactive ecosystem where in the

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,720
react core team sorry we're called

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,250
librarian where things are moving over

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,680
slightly to this and it's not yet a

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,880
perfect transition and obviously were

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,530
legacy code bases you're still going to

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,960
have a class component so it's not

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,890
understanding where when this applies

00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,970
there are a bunch of other bunch of

00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,370
other questions I think that we need to

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,080
expect and we we as experts need to be

00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,940
prepared to have things to have answers

00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,830
to these questions or these know where

00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,320
to point people the first one is where

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,210
as the rest of the framework people keep

00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,300
telling me react as a framework grant is

00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:10,049
not a framework we act as UI library the

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,069
wide

00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:12,299
they come with roofing why doesn't it

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,470
come with state management it does kind

00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,519
of no Commerce State management well why

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,289
doesn't that come with the things old

00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,489
expecting application to have react it's

00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:19,860
just the bit that you see there's a

00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:21,809
whole bunch of other things that are

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,919
probably in your application and you

00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:25,049
have a fact get framework things like

00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,720
Gatsby and next that provide us this

00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,369
this routes list re routing and

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,570
opinionated ways to do things but a lot

00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:33,239
of time it kind of comes down to us to

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,830
have these conversations something else

00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:36,659
I've had a lot of people ask me is I

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,220
hope you should be using redux this is a

00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:39,119
very nuanced conversation to have with

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,789
someone especially if they're just

00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,869
coming to JavaScript because and react

00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:44,820
even sorry because there's a lot of

00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,929
literature out there saying why Redux is

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,249
a really good thing to be using why

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,230
here's kind of the state management du

00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:50,609
jour and there are cases where it is

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,869
appropriate because it does a lot of

00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:53,519
really fantastic things and because it's

00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:55,529
immature it has a great ecosystem around

00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,590
it what it also has is that a boiler

00:17:55,529 --> 00:18:00,179
plate and a lot of mental gymnastics

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,629
that's beginning to understand what's

00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,889
going on and why any extraneous people

00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:07,139
that now we've got better solutions were

00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:09,480
things that react native context API we

00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:10,980
could perhaps do things with react just

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,859
react without having to reach out for

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,210
something like redux or move X right now

00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,200
having that conversation is very

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,970
difficult one because there's a lot of

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,519
evidence telling you you're wrong in the

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,049
big literature what should we test again

00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,059
I don't know whatever you want to test

00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,320
really there's no guidance here should

00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,489
we be testing what a component renders

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,779
out because I'll be that's all to use

00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:29,100
the cares about is what does my page

00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:30,720
look like I don't need to test the

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,369
internal logic sometimes I click a

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,960
button and something happens that's all

00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:35,669
into test that is a perfectly valid

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,619
argument to have that reduces your test

00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:40,169
coverage surface but it also reduces the

00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:41,879
only two things that are visible I have

00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:43,769
the conversation with your team why

00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:44,879
can't I just do this in CSS so if

00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:45,989
someone comes from a more typical web

00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:47,279
development background they might look

00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:49,679
at something like solid components and

00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,249
just not understand why someone would do

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,440
this to themselves to the world at large

00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:57,029
which is often counteract where this

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,820
other question I get is why do I have to

00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:00,869
use CSS so people that come from

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,970
especially who've come from a Java

00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:06,749
background they may have seen some

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:08,489
legacy CSS which is horrible and they

00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:10,889
associate CSS with these single massive

00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:13,169
files where everything is bang important

00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:14,460
and just horribly architect not well

00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:16,679
understood and now obviously got a lot

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,580
more understanding about CSS we kind of

00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,990
see it's that's more to it than scope

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,980
CSS there's a lot of great things we can

00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,100
do with it now that we couldn't do

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,860
before but some people haven't seen that

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,570
don't understand

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,029
that's something that I take great

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,740
pleasure in discussing their people the

00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:30,940
last question is related to react but

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,440
will say to the world at large

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,720
why is everyone to a designer with each

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,590
other I don't know guys why is that one

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,269
on two it was so angry at each other

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,039
there was a lot of opinions everyone

00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:41,500
likes to have a hot take around the

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,669
JavaScript community we really play up

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,409
to this idea that everything's changing

00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,549
every 7 minutes it's not we're pretty

00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:47,740
good we're pretty stable we're pretty

00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:49,090
cover guys so when you are new and

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,919
coming to the community and you reach

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,000
out you go okuu who are the people in

00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,590
the lead of this field maybe I should

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,789
follow them on Twitter because you know

00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,799
they'll let me know what's coming up and

00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:58,360
what might be interesting no it's just

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,700
getting angry each other and there's

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,409
been some big drama recently oh it's

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,880
completely unnecessary especially we

00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,990
just come into reaction you start

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,929
understanding the things we've just been

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,130
spoken about it's very detracting expect

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:11,350
to answer that question and expect to

00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,090
provide guidance questions you will want

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,880
to expect these are things I really wish

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,980
my team asked me about but I never do so

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,889
the first one is literally anything

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:23,200
about JSX JSX is super interesting and

00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:24,610
really covering what it does because you

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,510
can put it in a JavaScript file it's not

00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,940
gonna draw on the screen but it still

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,700
gives you it still compiles down for you

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,110
and it looks like ht1 but it's not HTML

00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,340
but it gets there and we've got these

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,139
reserved words that class and class name

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,639
that we find very interesting design

00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:38,980
questions and architectural questions

00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:41,289
that no one wants to speak to me about

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,760
and I have to read a lot about in case

00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:43,929
someone had like a really tiny question

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,389
about it no they just got it because it

00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:48,789
looks so much like HTML they get it they

00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:49,389
write it they move on no no questions

00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,399
for me

00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:53,470
we have lifecycle methods because we

00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:55,690
started working just out of hooks API

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,010
got released we were very fortunate that

00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,260
a lot of our code bases kind of hooks

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,460
from day zero which is been fantastic so

00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,919
I spend a lot more time learning about

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,750
myself like my style hooks when I was

00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,950
coming in to react obviously and then no

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,630
no one was to talk about them anymore

00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,639
and it means if people don't have those

00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,250
perhaps as good understanding of the

00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:13,720
life cycle of a component which arguably

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,980
is bad because they're kind of now

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,659
hidden and abstracted away behind these

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,519
declarative ideas they just don't get

00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:20,080
given to us and cross browser

00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:21,549
compatibility this is not a solve

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,289
problem just want to I'm not claiming

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:25,450
that but because things like they will

00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:27,100
now come built into so many or like

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,330
crate reactor and all these things we

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,220
can compile things down to at least go

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,370
down to like ie 11 and what's that like

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,370
98 99 %

00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,870
rather use cases we can reach 98 99

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,370
percent of value of our browsers or

00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,620
users without doing a single thing it

00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,120
just happens it just builds for us

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,890
very few people care about reach an

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,030
extra 1 or 2 percent very people should

00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,860
care about reaching that 1 or 2 percent

00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:49,130
because it is only one or two doesn't

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,590
make direct your resources when you're

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,450
having these discussions or forcing

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,160
people to recognize how cool JSX is when

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,480
you're doing that there's a couple of

00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,710
things you need to be aware of you need

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,540
to make sure that things work for your

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,130
team needs made the work for your

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,960
project and they work for your company

00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,670
there are no right answers or else we

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,590
would we wouldn't be in his mess we're

00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,910
in this mess so keep making different

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,900
opinions keep thinking about who you're

00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,580
working with when you're working with

00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,260
Java developers maybe use things that

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,430
are more familiar to the get a set of

00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,900
mindset maybe use things that are more

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,460
imperative because it will make them

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,020
more productive and because the context

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,910
switching of going from one framework to

00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,170
the other will be reduced they can

00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,300
continue to be a more productive full

00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,710
statement full stack team member and you

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,270
as a team can continue to move forward

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,650
to iterate faster to all these wonderful

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,790
things that you as your company need and

00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,860
then you can go home when you evening

00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,720
you can write these weird hooks that no

00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,520
one will ever use on your NPM package

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,920
that no downloads and you can just take

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,640
great joy in it but at work these the

00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,440
way we need to be having conversations

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,170
so how do we structure it good good

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,340
conversations this is a open set deep

00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,900
cut frames reference but it's definitely

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,190
a very specific friends reference know

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,600
if anyone's seen this episode of friends

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:52,490
if you have some very funny picture I'm

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,140
going to talk to you and I have been

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,930
talking to you like you are not experts

00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,600
but you are and I know that you are and

00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,250
I know that you know that I know that

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,170
you are but we have to talk to each

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,910
other as if we're not we have to start

00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,530
to understand the level of ashume

00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,110
knowledge that we are assuming that's

00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,160
you knowledge that we have is different

00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,840
the way that we speak to people the

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,520
language we use has to be really

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,380
tailored to someone not understanding

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,820
anything about the purse but the

00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,320
specifics of the react or library

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,000
anything about the specifics of how we

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,620
come how JavaScript post compiled down

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,030
anything about how the browser renders

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,770
it we just have to assume that we're all

00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,420
just developers we have to assume

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,950
they're all just humans just trying to

00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,980
just trying to get home just want to

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:33,410
have a have a good day at work and this

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,790
is very difficult because everything is

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,200
on fire all the time with the front-end

00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,520
community it's this is just a whole

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,650
bunch of stuff and it's all moving very

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,270
fast and there's no real best practices

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,650
as we've just spoken about this the

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,630
building is still very complicated but

00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:46,580
I'm not very good at build tooling

00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,950
and the thing that's most interesting to

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,169
me here is the front of the front guy is

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,809
that we have to think is someone who is

00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:54,860
designing pixel-perfect user experiences

00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:56,029
and thinking about these really cool

00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,000
animations are thinking about how we

00:23:56,029 --> 00:24:00,980
create these experiences and then I hand

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,870
that off to myself and I have to make it

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,039
and that's not a very enjoyable process

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,840
because often you want to make things

00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:07,399
that are different to what might be

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,500
possible or what you might be capable of

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:11,659
making so we have to set really separate

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,639
out those two parts of ourselves the the

00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:15,860
kind of implemented a doer and the the

00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:19,580
dreamer the Hopa when you're making your

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:21,289
privacy enhancing technology so group

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,909
discussions that i'm glad that we had

00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:24,529
these are the discussions that we had

00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:27,110
quite at the beginning that instigated

00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:30,169
very consciously and very purposefully

00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,639
and I got my team in a room and we just

00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,960
had out these ideas and a great time was

00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:34,879
had by me but not by the rest of the

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,649
team so how we gonna strike to

00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:38,120
misapplication react I'm gonna say again

00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:39,830
four people on the back react as a UI

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,059
library native framework so you've got

00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,950
to have a lot of understanding around

00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:44,299
your team and how everything is immune

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,429
structured where is your state how are

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:47,539
you accessing your API how are you

00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:50,000
accessing your starting are you gonna

00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:52,940
have a storybook style situation which I

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,100
would recommend how is all that going to

00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,289
fit together what do you need how are we

00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,070
going to handle Battlefront development

00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:59,600
being out of sync

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,950
there will become a time where your

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,450
back-end developers will promise you

00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,519
something and it won't get delivered

00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,809
immediately which is outrageous so

00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:07,309
you're gonna have to have some kind of

00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:09,080
mocking in place to kind of to get the

00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:11,210
gate get the data that you need to make

00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,590
the the fantastic user interface that

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,850
you want to make so you need to be aware

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,289
that that is going to happen it might

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,399
just happen once for us it was a very

00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,899
rare occurrence and very low cost

00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:19,340
occurrence but I'm really glad that we

00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:22,730
understood that it would happen and kind

00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,379
of prepared for it how are we going to

00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,299
handle a manage state so what is local

00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:27,889
versus application level do we want to

00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:30,710
bring the reducer pan into it I don't

00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:33,200
some people do but be aware that it's

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,480
all an option and what styling

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,399
architecture work to you this is perhaps

00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,980
the most inflammatory thing you can say

00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:41,629
about to a roomful of job developers but

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,950
should we be using CSS and J's so she'll

00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:47,970
be using like a CSS build chain

00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:50,600
as for example longer form discussions

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,770
so these are discussions that we had

00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,480
over a period of time wasn't like a sit

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,920
down getting a room to sign or something

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
would we'll talk about if it doesn't

00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,860
work these are things that over the

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,780
course of sort of six months we really

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,880
kind of refined our opinions over so

00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,570
when is it right to bring a third party

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,490
package first when a budget role Arun

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:10,260
when do we how do we integrate and how

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,910
do we interact with client-side and

00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,770
server-side work so that's kind of

00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,360
speaks for both us as developers but

00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,980
also the communication between those two

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,300
that in software the hardest thing is

00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,550
always the boundary between two systems

00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,930
right so how do we how do the finance

00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,300
staff talk to our server side stuff etc

00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:26,310
etc and the coding and infant standards

00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,080
so coding and linting standards are

00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,060
there to help you and to serve you and

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,780
your team directly if you're getting to

00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,580
a place where you're having to

00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:34,650
alphabetically order your imports to a

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,000
file for literally no reason just take

00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,070
it out you don't need to do it you're

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,690
not a slave to a machine to order your

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,770
inputs alphabetically we will have

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:45,810
better things to do with our time than

00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:48,180
that refine it please the last thing I

00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,800
promised before we get into some actual

00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,960
pragmatic stuff and they don't leave

00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,940
unit we want to look at having

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,990
productive conversations so I find the

00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,640
best way to kind of communicate

00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,630
especially with back-end developers so

00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,890
these people would be working on

00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,400
software development if you know 5-10

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,410
years already

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,850
they understand code if I bring in code

00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,020
and I send them code before and in the

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,130
meeting we talk about the code and we

00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,140
look at it and we understand what it

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,060
looks like it's a very is becomes less

00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,710
of a philosophical conversation or more

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,810
of a developer experience conversation

00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,400
which is really important always find

00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,350
the common ground we're all intelligent

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,730
people we're all able to learn something

00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,080
that's why we're all developers you have

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,600
to be able you have to have an intrinsic

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,450
ability to learn and you do people have

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,950
that never underestimated be care about

00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,750
the decision you're making and how

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,920
urgent it is if something is like a one

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,870
out of ten don't worry about getting

00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,070
amazing sometimes like seven or eight

00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,780
pop-up and you want to get everyone in a

00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,700
room that day to talk about how urgent

00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,020
it is I'm willing to make a decision and

00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,220
always be sure to present alternatives

00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,780
even if you think your tenant is a

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,870
literally the worst thing to ever happen

00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:44,060
to JavaScript there are a couple of

00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,810
resources I keep recommending to people

00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,950
only when they ask I don't just

00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,270
recommend this to people I should just

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,820
start right there costing people on the

00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,650
street with Twitter handles so if people

00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,780
are asking for people to follow and

00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,580
newsletters and websites to go to these

00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,930
this is the most

00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,960
romantic advice I can offer the react.js

00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:01,820
official Doc's are fantastic go to them

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,770

top top to bottom you'll learn you'll

00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,290
learn something there's an advanced

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,600
section go to it can I recommend it off
