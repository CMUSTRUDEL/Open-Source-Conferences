thanks for sticking around I think we're

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,359
good to go

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,000
first of all I'm Alex like Atos I do a

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,160
bunch of things in this world I help

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,500
Messiah I volunteer for Mozilla I'm a

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,389
representative mentor which is basically

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,940
I have them build community worldwide

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:21,180
and I'm also one of the tech speakers

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,310
that means I help our local contributors

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,470
to get better public speaking especially

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,449
in front of a tech audience and I

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,949
instead of us having to fly halfway

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,170
around the world to do a meet-up they

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,989
could do that I do like the idea of

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,020
having a paycheck and getting paid so I

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,270
I work at maximum as a JavaScript

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,120
developer advocate anyone here heard

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,430
about next poem before ok quite a few

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,410
that's cool for the rest of you next

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,289
what do cloud communications API they

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,170
have like an IPA to send and receive SMS

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,120
is make voice calls create chat

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,770
application or even have voice it's not

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,600
like that I'm not going to talk about

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,570
that what I want to talk about tonight

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,430
as a world without JavaScript and this

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,220
is a reason why I want to talk about

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,950
this so I think about two months ago

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,320
I've met Cheryl at one of the many many

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,119
London events and she gave me a

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,180
challenge she said ok you're a

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,430
javascript engineer what happens if

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,430
there's no JavaScript it was like well

00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:22,500
the browser wars weren't bloody what do

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,920
you mean and then I started looking at

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,520
it like what if the browser was actually

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,350
ended and JavaScript was gone from this

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,380
world javascript was forbidden and when

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,650
I first started looking into this the

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,110
very first page I saw said when you have

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,509
eliminated JavaScript whatever remains

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,009
my must be an empty page and I kind of

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,380
freaked out I was like there's no world

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,689
without JavaScript what do you mean and

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,329
this is Google Maps by the way and if

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,610
you if you go and disable JavaScript so

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,189
what I did for most of us as I went on

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,439
disable JavaScript completely out of my

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,740
browser and I tried to see if there's

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,719
some hope Google map says there isn't

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,740
and there are big fat liars by the way

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,039
and I went on Alex's top 50 websites and

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,610
I started going through them one by one

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,730
trying to see which one works how good

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,440
rating them subs orts and then for those

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,110
actually work because apparently there

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,879
are few that work seeing what makes them

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,680
take what what makes them work how

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,640
there's a world without JavaScript how

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,680
does this world look like if I went onto

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,110
Facebook and Facebook shows this pop-up

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,190
that says well you don't have just 50

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,560
store but here's this whatever legacy

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,690
mobile optimized version mobile mobile

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,250
optimized version of Facebook I was like

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,920
yeah cool let's see how it works and

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,110
this is how it looks so it on my on my

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,180
laptop which is a 13-inch laptop it has

00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,329
no idea of responsiveness or otherwise

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,209
even no responsiveness is a CSS feature

00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:59,239
and I still have CSS and it looks like

00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:02,450
Facebook is toluca I know five six years

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,310
ago seven maybe you can scroll through

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,019
posts and stuff like that if you try to

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,750
interact like if you're at the bottom of

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,459
page and you click like you get a page

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,109
reload without knowing where you were

00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,170
left and stuff like that if you try to

00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:18,049
post there's no rich posting experience

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,060
this basically text I think okay this is

00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:21,680
the like the the second most form

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,840
because the first most popular site in

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,510
there which is Google actually works

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,579
perfectly fine without without

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,530
JavaScript except it has no autocomplete

00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:32,840
that's the only feature that's missing

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,849
from Google autocomplete otherwise works

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,250
perfectly fine the second one was

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:39,950
Facebook and this gave me hope I was

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,750
like okay the top to work so it must be

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,760
okay like people thought about this

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,470
because there's a lot of people out

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,709
there who actually do disable JavaScript

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,599
and then I started keeping a bunch of

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,480
thoughts mostly used them for example

00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,970
which shows you so what I thought was

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,430
they were showing elements in there that

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:01,010
weren't being populated now it's just a

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,500
background image at least at least at

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,359
least a background image has some sort

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,510
of branding and I can figure out its

00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:10,760
YouTube and I was like well there's a

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,470
bunch of sites that handle video in

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,690
there I was like well you're not gonna

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,789
look at every one of them just see what

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,859
makes them tick and they looked at most

00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:21,109
video streaming websites in there now

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,390
the only problem was some of the video

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,700
streaming websites in there are actually

00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,340
poor related and I have to have an

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,139
interesting car

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,750
session with my IT department to

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:37,110
whitelist pornhub on my computer because

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:40,080
I needed as research for a talk a week

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,330
later my manager actually looking on the

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,010
on the website and seeing that I speak

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,620
about the world without JavaScript

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,479
I now have have pornhub enabled and my

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,820
laptop goes missing from my desk from

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:58,169
time to time the next one up there was

00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:00,750
Wikipedia and those it was this whole

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:03,360
thing in which I actually click disable

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,979
JavaScript and enable JavaScript a

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,470
couple of times until I figured out

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,600
Wikipedia works just the same without

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,100
JavaScript there's no visual indicator

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,590
that there's no JavaScript on the page

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,010
and when I look behind the scene as

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,750
Wikipedia they only do some some minor

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,460
stuff Angelica hood like that javascript

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,500
is under 50 kilobytes of JavaScript

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,660
there's no outside framework mostly do

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,940
some sort of tracking and when you go in

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,860
edit mode you get a richer contextual

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,720
experience but on the actual page of

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,750
Wikipedia consuming Wikipedia are not

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,229
creating Wikipedia there's no no

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,450
difference with or without JavaScript of

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:42,750
course there's a few exotic websites in

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:45,889
there like double Q which apparently is

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,900
an e-commerce block platform from Asia

00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:51,419
it's not exactly working it's showing

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,210
something's placeholders and some text

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,599
and if I knew any I'm guessing that's

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,460
Japanese I'm guessing I have no idea but

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,560
if I knew the language probably I would

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,840
understand something from it but this is

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,520
a whole new class of thing so I looked

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,169
at video things because it's a class of

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,700
video rendering sites for video

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:11,039
streaming and then there's the

00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,139
e-commerce platforms and I was like well

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,940
you need to have a card there's a lot of

00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,340
interactivity with an e-commerce site

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,660
obviously video doesn't work ecommerce

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,510
isn't gonna work

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,220
and then I stumbled upon Amazon and this

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,740
one is the one that he pressed me the

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,770
most it's not as pretty as with

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,500
JavaScript it's actually working not

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,570
pretty but working and actually I have a

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,090
few friends at Amazon and I reached out

00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:39,700
I was like why does Amazon why can I

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:42,730
order a product on Amazon without

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,010
javascript and we went into this lengthy

00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,680
conversation but the Cata long story

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:51,550
short days they have to invest a lot of

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,230
time and money and they got some well

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,360
ancient knowledge to make this work

00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,760
without JavaScript because they used to

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,740
have the old versions of Kindle and the

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,330
old versions of Kindle came with an

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,050
internet connection an always-on

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:07,750
internet connection and the web except

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,400
it couldn't run JavaScript so they had

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,890
to make everything like if you wanted to

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,120
buy a book from the Kindle even today

00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,220
when you buy a book from the Kindle you

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,140
don't have JavaScript in the experience

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,450
banked anywhere but you can still buy

00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,400
the book and I think this is the biggest

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:25,630
website I've seen like Wikipedia aside

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:28,330
which is basically an encyclopedia as

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:31,060
like information you consume it's not

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,950
really interactive or a web app or any

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,530
type of modern things you think about

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:39,310
when you build JavaScript Amazon

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,750
actually works without it and later on

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,730
in the talk I'm going to actually tell

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,370
you how it works behind the scene

00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,080
because we spent I think I spent with my

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,940
first ones I think we spent like two

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,400
weeks going back and forth over emails

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,230
trying to figure out to find someone who

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,930
actually worked in this and maintains

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:58,930
this version of it and to figure out how

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:01,090
it works exactly I went on through to

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,760
another social media platform which is

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,340
Twitter and Twitter is built with modern

00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,470
tools and I I'm proud that they do that

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,870
I like I'm impressed they do that and it

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,630
first far better than Facebook so you

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,370
have you have the same prompt saying hey

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,860
you don't have JavaScript you want Ali

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,930
legacy version of Twitter but if you

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,090
look behind they actually start

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,040
rendering the page because they're using

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,500
server-side rendering rendering for the

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,570
first server the page and that loads

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,280
without JavaScript is just the server

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,770
takes all the JavaScript does all the

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,550
interactive part of my french and

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:39,220
then and then it serves that up for a

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,900
really fast first load and then Johnson

00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,820
gets loaded and that takes over the page

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,550
but you see the first page without

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,430
JavaScript and I wanted to see what the

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,529
the legacy twitter client looked like I

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,470
looked at Facebook and Facebook was on

00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,999
horrible and Twitter's isn't faring well

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,939
isn't faring better in terms of

00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:59,019
responsiveness by the way the

00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:02,740
mobile-friendly version of Facebook was

00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:04,899
amped at facebook.com/ he's at

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:09,009
facebook.com/ this actually still loads

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:11,740
on Twitter just with a with a post with

00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:13,600
a post option at the end of it and it's

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,199
what they used to have before they

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,120
started doing that PW a web page now

00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:23,050
everything works fast because it's just

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,089
pure HTML and CSS because it's pure HTML

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,790
and CSS when you click favorite for

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:30,639
example or something like that the page

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,790
loads this one actually has all the

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,220
anchor tags and semantic HTML behind so

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,949
the process can figure out what element

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,930
you were at before and strolling happens

00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:42,999
and a bunch of different things I was

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,379
like okay so socials websites are

00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:47,110
actually faring better than anything

00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:48,579
else because I know they've been around

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,050
for a while they want all the

00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:51,519
interaction they've got something that

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,069
kind of works and they're keeping that

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,490
and then I stumbled upon this beauty

00:09:54,069 --> 00:10:00,399
which is basically a blank sorta white

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,829
page can you figure out which social

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,910
media is that which social platform is

00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:10,059
that yep you've got that that's

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,399
Instagram Instagram loads sorta kind of

00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:14,800
blank page and then I started looking

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,110
behind Instagram to see what they're

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,670
doing and it turns out they use the

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,589
modern JavaScript framework I'm not

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,250
gonna say which one you guys figure it

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,959
out

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,420
but they use one of the modern

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,490
frameworks they just didn't bother to

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,899
invest in server-side rendering so the

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,480
first time they serve you the page they

00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:34,269
serve you the massive massive JavaScript

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,399
framework and an empty element it's an

00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,990
empty body element that has a tag gets

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,269
overwritten by the JavaScript framework

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,910
but because Java doesn't happen on that

00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:44,319
page nothing happens on the page it

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,689
doesn't even have like the most

00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:48,370
confusing thing hours at least you two

00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:50,230
had some branding so you can figure out

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,259
what page you were on this one has no

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,540
branding because for example if I open

00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:58,420
it on top in my Kindle the URL bar is

00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,889
not visible from first load so it's a

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,449
little it's a blank page you have to

00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:03,730
kind of figure it out and I was like

00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:05,620
okay but then I stumbled upon

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,540
one of the one of the video websites

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,880
which look promising like compared to

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:14,019
everything girls it had images because

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,820
the way the way YouTube works is they

00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:18,220
generate an image based on the video

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,540
which gets put as the cover and load it

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,550
first and then the video is hidden

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,690
behind the image but there because they

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,540
don't have JavaScript they don't even

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,670
bother with that but Netflix / bra

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,279
browse so you could login into Netflix

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,050
just fine without JavaScript and then on

00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,630
the Browse page it actually knew it was

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,240
me it knew what I watched what would the

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:40,300
new releases actually showed where I was

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,250
what I was with my previous movies and I

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,250
was like okay so someone actually

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,779
decided to use html5 video cuz html5 it

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,850
actually works for video streaming and

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:51,130
they got all excited I was like okay so

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,500
I can watch Netflix without without

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:56,139
JavaScript and then as soon as I clicked

00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,290
one of the one of the movies it went to

00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:01,899
a dark page it's like - a black page not

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,490
even branding not even nothing I was

00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:06,070
looking at one of the articles online

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,589
about Netflix and someone else tried the

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:11,410
Netflix experience they used to have

00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:16,720
like a logo in one of the corners they

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:18,399
got rid of that and I liked the network

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,560
engineering team is one of the best

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,000
engineering teams around a lot of people

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,440
a lot of people actually give give back

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,480
to the open-source community and I

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,829
always thought okay so you guys have the

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,990
ones who are gonna invest because if you

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:33,550
think about it that's some time

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,410
commitment to invest into a world

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,810
without JavaScript I was like you guys

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,730
probably have invested into that and I

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,680
reached out to a former Netflix engineer

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,170
I don't happen to know anyone who still

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,589
worked for them who works for Google now

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:50,410
and I was like why don't you guys do did

00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:52,060
a video or html5 video because that's

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,949
supposed streaming and all the nice and

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,860
fancy things stuff like that without

00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:58,810
JavaScript out of the box and his main

00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,410
response was basically because with

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:06,399
html5 only a few browsers signed the DRM

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:09,250
agreement and it turns out if they can't

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,640
be sure about DRM they're not going to

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,709
bother it a at all the way the player

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,960
they're using is a proprietary one built

00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:19,270
for them with the DRM

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,100
just inside and stuff like that and I

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,590
guess this is yet another way we got

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,090
screwed by by SOPA and PIPA in the long

00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:28,450
run

00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:31,090
the last website I kind of looked at was

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:34,120
imager and when I loved it the first

00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:36,760
page everything worked I could see the

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,390
images I could do a new post it looked

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,950
like imager was the same thing I was

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,560
like okay so I looked at rabbit

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,270
previously and the only feature of rabid

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,580
that didn't work was the app vote down

00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:50,410
vote but everything else was fine I was

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,850
like okay one of the cause imager and

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,410
read that kinda peered on the internet

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:57,180
around the same time they're really old

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:59,920
they have the same concept of old-school

00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,960
HTML CSS of cool-looking websites I was

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,440
like okay this is really interesting and

00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,120
then I found out that team actually

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,280
started changing over the past couple of

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,440
years and they're inside pages or their

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,120
post pages and stuff like that have been

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,070
completely rewritten with jaws few

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,560
frameworks and all the nice bells and

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:19,900
whistles and the homepage is the only

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,970
one who has written because it has to be

00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,970
fast the first page has to load fast so

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,550
it's pure HTML and CSS and I was like

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,650
okay there's actually some websites

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:33,430
which function really well or some web

00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,600
subs some websites which don't you can't

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,330
even figure out the difference between

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,670
JavaScript and no JavaScript and I

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,010
figured okay there is hope there's hope

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,910
in a world without JavaScript and when I

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,560
looked at how the world is built as

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:51,580
basically pure HTML and CSS and that's a

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,790
given because maybe JavaScript came

00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:57,490
after HTML CSS when the first browser

00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:59,530
word at the stack space it understood

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,420
HTML and CSS and it wasn't really a

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:04,660
visual interface it was a bunch of

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:07,750
command like thanks that parsed all that

00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,520
and JavaScript wasn't even the first web

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,340
language might just have one before

00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,250
Moseley came up with JavaScript so it

00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,680
works without it HTML CSS you're safe

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,370
with that and then I figured all the

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,540
server-side operability or

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,150
interoperability happens with post

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,430
requests with forms or get requests via

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:30,110
links that means whenever you click the

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:33,589
little heart icon on Twitter you are

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:36,430
we load the new page or send the post

00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:39,470
request saying I clicked on this and

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:42,740
there's no fancy things like put or

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:45,410
delete or options or any of that kind at

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,910
least I haven't spied like I still open

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,440
up all those pages in the network

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,390
inspector trying to see what happens

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,579
behind the scenes and I haven't seen a

00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:56,170
single put request even when I try to

00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:59,390
update my user this happens we have post

00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:01,910
so I looked at the way code was built

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,130
like HTML was built and they basically

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:07,010
used semantic HTML instead of having a

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,660
bunch of different dips with CSS and a

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,480
bunch of JavaScript that makes it look

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,370
like it makes it act like a button or

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,290
something else it's just basically

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,959
semantic HTML because hTML is actually

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,370
powerful when you use the tags for what

00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:22,670
they were meant not just Dave's

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,680
everywhere it some of them have some

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,320
sort of dynamic city not necessarily

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,029
interactivity with CSS and CSS

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,370
animations and stuff like that and those

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,470
still work on the web when you want to

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:39,470
do programmable animations while you're

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:42,079
 out of luck and some of them out

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,779
there not the fancy ones not the top-50

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,269
some of them who have their own mp4 or

00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:49,220
proprietary videos work with the video

00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:51,199
tag as most people will put a video tag

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,760
before they'll put a YouTube object

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,220
because YouTube still have its branding

00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,410
and so that means most of the corporate

00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,880
I hate to tell you most of the corporate

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,420
websites out there still work without

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,250
JavaScript just fine and that was like

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,049
okay so there's some sort of world

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,290
without JavaScript the whole apocalypse

00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:11,030
came but is it worth living the world

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,699
without javascript is like is it worth

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,240
it and when I thought about because I

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,740
spent probably the better part of a week

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,299
playing around with websites or trying

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,549
to actually use websites without

00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:24,890
JavaScript and after about the week I

00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:27,140
well I started tallying the pros and

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:29,299
cons a lot honestly when I started this

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,549
I didn't actually think there was there

00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:34,190
were gonna be any pros to this exercise

00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:36,530
in futility but it turns out that

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,260
there's actually a few pros

00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:42,770
there's no ads on most pages I think the

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,920
only page that had an ad is Facebook so

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,480
Surfside served ads because they'd make

00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,640
their own ads they serve their own ads

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,770
they look horrible and you wouldn't

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,010
click them but they still serve with a

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,980
page but most of the web because ads get

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:00,260
loaded via JavaScript from Google they

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,420
have no ads there's no more endless

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,220
troll and they thank God for that but

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,100
that doesn't mean that the Facebook page

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,650
that loads has like 400 different posts

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,900
on the load there's a good part about

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,720
that because it's only HTML and CSS it

00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,460
blows in under a second but it's it's

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,550
extremely extremely long but there's no

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,110
more endless scrolling animation there's

00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:25,520
no more more those begging for attention

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:27,290
to this subscribe to the newsletter to

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,860
share this on Twitter to share this on

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:33,080
Facebook to have a discount whatever

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,350
there's no more models on the web

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,990
because these JavaScript actually pop up

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,790
and if it's a regular pop-up blocker I

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,860
haven't actually seen anyone that doing

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:45,440
a regular pop-up blocker because pop-up

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:48,680
cause of the pop-up blockers there's no

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,490
tracking well I'm kidding I'm just

00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,140
kidding

00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,360
there's some sort of tracking so I've

00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,210
seen a few websites do this thing called

00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,020
pixel tracking where they'll have a one

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:02,840
pixel image a blank one pixel image that

00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,450
goes to a URL with the post request at

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,760
the end which says something and they'll

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,340
track you like for that and you can see

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,590
that someone visited the page but you

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,570
can't see what clicks I made that I

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,580
scrolled how long I stayed on your page

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,490
there's no user activity tracking

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:22,550
anymore this just visits which in my

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:25,910
book that's fine fine with me because

00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:28,640
it's HTML and CSS and usually it ends up

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,140
being under 200 kilobytes like Facebook

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,500
was the biggest page I've loaded without

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:38,600
JavaScript the load time is impressive

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:44,930
it just it happens instantly and P what

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:46,880
am P like nope nope and because it

00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,980
doesn't the JavaScript so the JavaScript

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,430
engine doesn't actually have anything to

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,410
run or to mess up the performance goes

00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,120
through the roof there's no lag there's

00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,300
no jitter there's no

00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,740
oh my my mouse is Beach falling over and

00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,620
over again because this page is trying

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:07,730
to run a slideshow for me nope

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:09,820
none of that and I can't think

00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,860
about like sitting in the audience and

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,800
hearing these people talk about a MP and

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:22,580
pwace and stuff like that I kind of

00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:25,880
figured well a MPs are a slightly more

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:29,150
expensive version of HTML CSS because it

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,090
gets JavaScript to interpret them PW

00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:34,310
ways are a way to run JavaScript ah for

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:37,430
progressive web apps and thought about

00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,780
the whole progressive terms progressive

00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,180
terms like well you have to have a

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,950
really good web app or web page before

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,320
you can make it a web app and then

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,600
progressive so I think you should you

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,640
guys should try an exercise of just

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,260
building something without JavaScript I

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,910
know I'm a JavaScript there I know I

00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,120
know what I'm asking for I'm a

00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,600
JavaScript app not reformed I'm an

00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,040
addict

00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,960
but I actually build something with

00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:05,240
JavaScript it's gonna be on my website

00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,590
as the main page starting in well I

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,110
deployed when I left

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,640
Heroku was down so probably tomorrow but

00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,700
I'd build my whole front page without

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,790
JavaScript to be honest it wasn't a big

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:19,400
page right thing I couldn't see the

00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:21,290
difference I just removed any JavaScript

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,380
in there but it still works and with

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:28,469
that I thank you

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,469
