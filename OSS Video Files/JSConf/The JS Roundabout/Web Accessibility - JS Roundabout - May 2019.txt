	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
so my name is Jam and I'm a front-end

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,309
developer for shell and I'm going to

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,410
talk about accessibility tonight and you

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,840
may be thinking that I'm talking about

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,410
this topic because I know a lot about it

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,770
but actually I don't and it's just very

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,230
recently that I've been tasked to make

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,230
sure that a website that we are

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,529
launching is accessible and this is when

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,619
I realize that I don't know much about

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:35,430
it I thought I did like alt text counts

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,559
doesn't it but yeah it's not until you

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,899
actually look into it that you realize

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,230
that you may be doing something that's

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:49,469
not correct or that there is more that

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:52,860
you can do for it so there's a lot of

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,579
definitions of web accessibility but it

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,789
all just means making websites usable

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,710
for everyone and there are standards in

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,659
place for this and that's what what kind

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:09,689
is about there's 13 guidelines that

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,840
under working and they're basically all

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:16,409
world boils down to being perceivable

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,689
operable understandable and robust and

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,780
there's one quick check that you can

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:25,320
actually do right away without any setup

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:29,430
or downloading anything and in terms of

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,890
operability you can use your keyboard so

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,380
you can navigate your page with just

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,320
using a keyboard and this will already

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:42,290
take you a long way in terms of

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,290
accessibility because this brings out

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,670
interactive elements on your app that

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,030
you can't get through by just using a

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,020
keyboard and when you can't get into a

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,180
feature it becomes useless but to do

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,159
this check you have to make sure that

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,030
you can see where you are on the page

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,360
first and that's why focus links are

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,959
very important and a lot of people would

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,590
want this removed for aesthetic reasons

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,319
but I urge you not to do that and if you

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:18,110
really hate the blue-ringed you could at

00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,290
least change it or replace it with

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:26,200
something that suits more for your

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,950
branding if you do put an alternative

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,860
style to it

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,190
please make sure that it's very obvious

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:38,060
and it really stands out because you may

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:39,260
have users that have low vision or have

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,620
colorblindness

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,560
which leads us to our next point ensure

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,130
sufficient color contrast and this goes

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,650
under the perceivable bucket in the

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,950
Walker guidelines color blindness is

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:58,099
actually very common it affects about 1

00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:01,640
in 12 men so we have to make sure that

00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:04,040
our websites can be seen by a lot more

00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,650
of our users but when you have normal

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,970
vision it's actually hard to check this

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:13,640
by just our eyes because we don't see

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,590
like what they see so I'll leave this

00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:21,079
slide for now and we'll come back to it

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:24,230
when I get to the slide about tools so

00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:27,350
I'll text everyone's favorite I think if

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,569
everyone if someone asks you about an

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,400
accessibility feature that you couldn't

00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:34,299
do this is probably the first thing that

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,480
you think about but it's actually also

00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:41,450
easy to get wrong so I'll show you first

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,660
what happens if you don't give an alt

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:48,739
text or an alt attribute so in this

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:51,169
example if the image has this file name

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:54,500
it will read it out and it will read it

00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:56,510
out every compare character and you can

00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,049
just imagine how annoying that's gonna

00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:03,680
be so what does that mean do we put an

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:07,250
alt text on every image that's not the

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,220
case as well so in this example so

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,549
there's in an icon and then a text next

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,859
to it in this case icon doesn't give any

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:17,900
more meaning it doesn't really add to it

00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:20,539
because there's already a text that

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,390
serves as the label for that link so

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:25,419
I'll show you what happens if you overdo

00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,419
it

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:32,969
linked magnifying glass search link

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:36,629
speech bubble contact link so if it's

00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:39,360
just decorative you don't have to make

00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:41,969
the screen reader read it out so what

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,300
you can do is ignore images that are

00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:49,430
just for pure decoration with adding and

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:53,069
alt attribute with an empty string and

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:56,639
make click search link

00:04:53,069 --> 00:05:00,750
contact link login so it sounds so much

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,840
better it's more direct and the alt text

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:07,439
doesn't actually clutter or like just

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,949
provide any more noise so just remember

00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,529
that an empty alt text is different from

00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:17,370
not giving an alt attribute at all and

00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:20,430
if you're still confused w3c has come up

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,219
with an out decision tree and I've

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,319
provided the link on my Twitter account

00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:27,479
because I don't know how else to share

00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,919
it that everyone can just access so

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:36,330
there's a hashtag jsr about a11y

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:40,229
so you can just like visit it there use

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,270
the Mantic HTML it's really hard to talk

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:45,360
about accessibility without talking

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:49,110
about semantic hTML because it's so core

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,289
to it when you say semantic it just

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,719
means meaning and in the context of the

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:58,219
web it's conveying the meaning of the

00:05:54,719 --> 00:06:01,919
page content there's two points that

00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:04,469
perfectly sum this up the first one is

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,469
to use elements according to their

00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:09,870
intended purpose when you use an element

00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:12,240
for the intended purpose all the

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,550
behaviors are already built in you don't

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,149
have to add any more or you don't have

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:21,509
to worry about adding focus or keyboard

00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:23,729
interactions by using javascript so if

00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:27,930
you're building a button use a native

00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:31,080
button and I know it's very easy to just

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:35,039
reach for a div because it's so generic

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,840
and it's like a blank canvas but leaves

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,660
have no semantic meaning

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,220
if a screen reader comes across a tip it

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,690
doesn't know what it's about

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,750
so I'll give you an example of a button

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:51,419
that's made with a div so it's our

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,880
tabindex has been put in to make sure

00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:57,150
that it's focusable but when a screen

00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,000
reader gets to this element it will read

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,880
it as download group instead of the

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,770
native download button so what this

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,310
group actually mean like when you hear

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,320
that

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,690
does that sound interactive to you you

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,630
don't even know what that's about

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:15,660
so you can just imagine if this is your

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,229
call to action a scenery the user may

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,520
get confused and just miss it and

00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:25,620
because they it doesn't sound like

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:29,160
something that they can click the other

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:32,280
point on semantic hTML is the separation

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,160
of content and presentation and so don't

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,250
use an element because of the style that

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,070
it gives you a very common example of

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,890
this is using an h1 because you want a

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,930
big text don't do that because headings

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:53,250
are actually more important than you

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:55,800
think so there was a study in 2017 by

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,580
web aim and they asked screenreader

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,680
users how how do you find an information

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,710
on a page that you haven't been to

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,050
before and 70 Perce almost 70 percent of

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,990
them said that they use this the

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,900
headings to find that information of

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:16,200
that page and this is very similar to

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:20,550
what a sighted user would do so you'd

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:23,220
look at a page scan it for big text or

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,070
bold text and these texts would give you

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:31,219
an idea of like what the contents of

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:34,620
that section has so it's important to

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:37,950
make sure that your headings are used

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:42,020
correctly and while screen reader users

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:45,480
can't see the size like normal normal of

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:48,209
excited user scan you can convey the

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,930
same hierarchy by using the correct age

00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:52,650
tag

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:55,290
and don't skip levels because it paints

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:59,280
a picture of what the page structure is

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:01,320
about headaches can allow assistive

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,380
technologies to quickly navigate the

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,300
page as shown by that survey and I'll

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,780
give you an example of how to do that in

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,780
voiceover

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,930
one way content continue heading Apple

00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:24,430
once he likens welcoming Kakadu 1.1 any

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,860
level to three items look a group note

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,060
heading level two absent what comes we

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,110
go to the menu this is a little two

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:34,870
headings menu menu so when you hit

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,750
command option you on voiceover you pull

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:40,600
up a set of shortcuts and these are

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:43,870
categorized into groups and one of them

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,050
is headings so you can browse by heading

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,660
levels as well like level 1 level 2

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,690
level 3 and this corresponds to the H

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:56,260
tag that you've used so now we've spoken

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:59,019
a lot about semantic HTML and using

00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,750
native elements when you can but what if

00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:03,639
you need something you need to build an

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,029
element that's custom and it doesn't

00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:10,420
exist with the native elements that's

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:13,389
what we're Aria comes in aria gives you

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,910
the ability to enhance or modify the

00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:18,519
semantic meaning of elements but there's

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:22,510
one very important thing to remember

00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,970
with Aria Aria does not modify behavior

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:29,649
all it does is tell the screen reader

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:33,540
that so this is what I want you to say

00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:35,860
but it doesn't give you the the other

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:40,510
functionalities or behavior of that

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:45,480
element so I was watching this video how

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:48,279
a screen reader user surfs the web and I

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,230
when I'm using a screen reader I don't

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,839
know what I'm doing actually I'm just

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,940
like tile being maybe like using the up

00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,040
and down button but if you're not a real

00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,069
screen reader user you don't use this

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:05,139
every day you don't really know how a

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:07,389
user would use it so this this video

00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:10,089
gives you a good insight on how a real

00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:13,600
user actually navigates the web with

00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:16,209
just a screen reader and in that video

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,610
she mentioned that when Aria is used

00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:21,850
well it's great but when it's used

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:24,670
totally it actually makes it worse worse

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,910
than not having it at all so the coding

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:34,600
principle keep it simple it's actually

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:37,120
quite applicable in accessibility so an

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,490
aria role defines what an element is

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,800
supposed to be to a screen reader if you

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,649
remember the fake button that we had

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,170
earlier if you put a roll of button in

00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:49,750
there when a screen reader gets to this

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,089
element it will read out download button

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,839
but you have to remember that that's all

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:59,769
it does you have to still provide all

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:03,160
the focus and keyboard interactions but

00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:08,440
like how do you know what those actually

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:11,200
are so there's a re authoring practices

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,890
guide which tells you all that you have

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,680
to know about an element and if you are

00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,500
building a custom element there's a lot

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,640
of different examples of widgets here

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,829
that probably meets what you're trying

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,829
to build anyway so don't reinvent the

00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:33,190
wheel there are ways to do it and it

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:39,160
already states how to build it and what

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:41,649
behaviors are expected provide labels to

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,430
interactive elements and there's a few

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:47,260
ways to label an element the first one

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,380
is probably something that you're

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:53,110
already familiar with but it only is

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,990
really intended for a specific number of

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:59,380
elements that are listed here what if

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:03,279
something that you want to label is not

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:05,769
part of this one's that's where are your

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:11,050
label can be used it can be used on any

00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:13,649
element and it overrides the the native

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,630
labeling mechanism so in this example

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:19,240
the link already has the text of share

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:21,730
without Aria label it will just say link

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,519
share but because we put an aria label

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,880
in there it overrides it and you can put

00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,680
a more descriptive like texting there

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:34,570
and that's what the screen reader would

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:37,720
read for you the other one is Aria

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:40,180
labeled by so like the Aria label you

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,780
can use it on any element but the main

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,760
difference

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,560
here is you're pointing to another

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,290
element to become the label

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,470
it's like saying whatever this element

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:53,590
is saying that's gonna be my label and

00:13:49,470 --> 00:14:00,250
it overrides nating labeling and Aria

00:13:53,590 --> 00:14:02,920
label so it jumps everything use all the

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,830
tools to help check your site there's a

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,590
lot of things to consider and where

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:11,110
those basically just scratch the surface

00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,450
it's really hard to remember it all and

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,570
if you look at the what kind guidelines

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,520
it's very dry I don't think anyone would

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,220
look at it and they'll be like yes I'm

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:24,070
ready to read this all but that's what

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,170
all the tools are good for it they give

00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,380
you a quick way to check against these

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:34,420
guidelines and standards and it gives

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:36,400
you back a nice report the first tool

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:40,120
that we're going to talk about is waged

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,510
by webaim so this is a Chrome extension

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,900
so how to use it is apart from

00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:49,270
downloading it is when you are on the

00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:55,500
page that you want to check you click

00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:58,960
the icon on Chrome and it puts out this

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:02,350
next side panel and it tells you what

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:06,070
the errors are it also append some icons

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:09,610
on the page what I like about this is

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:12,220
that it's visual and you can tell just

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:15,610
by a quick look where which parts of the

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:19,060
page actually has a lot of errors but it

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:21,490
can also be a downside as well because

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,100
when there's a lot going on it can be

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,850
quite hectic and it's really hard to

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:30,130
like see what the errors are so what I

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:35,860
what I do is I combine this with another

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:40,210
tool for checking accessibility so the

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:43,840
other tool that I use is ax by DQ it's

00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:47,260
also a chrome extension tool and I try I

00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:52,570
wanted to test it on links cars comm and

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:53,970
this is how you use it so you open the

00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,699
[Music]

00:15:53,970 --> 00:16:00,359
chrome dev tools and it's under ax and

00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:05,779
you just click the analyze button and

00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:05,779
it'll give you back a nice report

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:14,699
funnily enough the areas for links cars

00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:18,019
is about color contrast so just coming

00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:20,549
back to color contrast automatic

00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:23,189
automated tests are really good for this

00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:25,470
because what kind would give you some

00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:28,319
guidelines of what the correct color

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,809
contrast is and with the naked eye

00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:33,029
there's no way to tell what three-to-one

00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:36,959
ratio is i I wouldn't know how to do

00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:40,049
that so when it comes to color contrast

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:45,389
I leave it to automated tools to do that

00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:48,979
for me last but not least is lighthouse

00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:54,019
by Chrome so it's also a prohm extension

00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:54,019
and we open up pretty much the same way

00:16:55,369 --> 00:17:00,869
it's under the audits tab begin it's

00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:03,899
actually part of a bigger suite

00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:05,909
you could also test performance and SEO

00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:13,139
web lighthouse and not just

00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:15,809
accessibility it gives you back this

00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:19,350
nice report and it gives you an overall

00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:21,839
score on the top right corner it's

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,449
running acts under the hood so you may

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,750
get responses that are quite similar to

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:31,950
what ax would give you but my favorite

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:36,000
part of this is actually the additional

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:37,769
items to manually check I really like

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,649
this part because it reminds you that

00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:43,379
you still need the human to properly

00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:49,649
audit as ID and test a product that

00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:51,960
another human would use so passing an

00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:54,840
automated audit doesn't mean that your

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,669
website is fully accessible at the end

00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,750
of the day all the tools are just

00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:04,409
checking code and I urge everyone to at

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:06,269
least try the keyboard test or listen to

00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:07,070
a screen reader because it's the only

00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:09,889
time for

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:12,980
me that I actually realized that my work

00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:17,059
matters and how you write code really

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:20,269
affects how other people can use it when

00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:22,909
you experience it yourself how unusable

00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:26,240
and an app could be or get the

00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:29,870
frustration of trying to do a simple

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,330
task and not being able to you realize

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:36,169
the impact that you have on users that

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:38,409
only have this as an option and this is

00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:40,340
the only way they can navigate the web

00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:43,399
there's a lot to learn about

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:47,710
accessibility but you have these tools

00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:50,029
to help you out and it doesn't don't get

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,610
intimidated when you get a lot of errors

00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:55,669
because if it's the first time that you

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:58,269
do an audit you will get a lot but you

00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:00,320
don't have to do it all in one go anyway

00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:02,929
do it step by step

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,389
and each step that you take for

00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:11,480
accessibility will be important for

00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:14,750
someone and some of your users so that's

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,950
it for my talk the links are posted with

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:21,970
this hashtag and on my Twitter and shell

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:25,850
is also hiring so if you email me at Jam

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:28,610
friendship s-19 detect I can hook you up

00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:31,100
and tell you more about what exciting

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,269
things were working on here at shell

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,269
thank you very much

00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,620
