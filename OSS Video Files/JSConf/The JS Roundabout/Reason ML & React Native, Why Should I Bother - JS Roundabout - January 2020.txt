Publication date: 2020-02-08
Playlist: The JS Roundabout
Description: 
	Sam Rowe from Red Badger. Talking about using ReasonML with React Native. ReasonML is a statically typed language that compiles to Javascript created by the original author of React. It provides a much safer and faster React development experience that we can make use of in React Native to produce apps with fewer bugs more quickly.
