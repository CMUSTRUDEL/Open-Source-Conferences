well I'm going to go across across go

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:13,940
through talk about is data fetching in

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:17,760
Gatsby so before did it do the standard

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,210
standard slides so well I was going to

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,970
call this talk this try this whoop Oh

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:26,039
was Bill time and Client runtime date

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,490
affection even gets beat but that's a

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,430
bit of a mouthful so just go with their

00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:35,010

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,829
being a web developer since 2018

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,399
professionally prior to that I was an

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,440
analyst developer for large financial

00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,059
organizations like I'm just reading for

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,629
list here Barclays fidelity and

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:03,930

I could talk about eggs all night

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:31,799
Boris leo Darcy there you go okay so

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,610
icebreakers out the way that's let's

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:40,110
talk a bit more about where I'm from I

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:42,780
work at a place called karma Rama we do

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,210
a lot of it's an ad agency we do a lot

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,710
of adverts for things like the army so

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,680
goods campaign we've got going at the

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:55,020
moment little guide dogs for the blind

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,920
and I work for the create products

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:03,899
department and we work with clients like

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,509
Tesco's I'm not sure if we're still

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,459
still work remember after what I've

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:12,850
heard this evening

00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:18,820
it was so vote for doing stuff of PT EDF

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:21,160
and sse and we've used gatsby for

00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,940
several of our clients so we've got get

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,160
to be in production and I'll share a

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:32,260
couple of the links with those within

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,300
now so first one is this one you may

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:39,520
have seen this advert in the cinema and

00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:43,510
that really is the URL and you can also

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:48,160
use the English spelling for us there's

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:52,060
also one for ASI Stargardt is everything

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:56,080
standards investments that's that's the

00:02:52,060 --> 00:03:01,030
one you want to look at so and this is

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,970
all what it's got here to say it is sort

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,490
of static who knows about Gatsby

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,800
what guess piers a couple of people cool

00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:13,210
cool cool

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:17,350
so before we talk about that we're also

00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:21,640
hiring so let's get out of the way so

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:25,150
right I do like to use excessive use of

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,430
gifts memes and emoji so let's get

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,550
cracking with the poll of already asked

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,710
who knows about Gatsby not many people

00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:35,220
so that's gonna sort of determine the

00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,220
rest of the talk

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:44,370
so anyone used to get you at work right

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:49,380
so rest of my questions are irrelevant

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:52,720
okay cool so there's this thing which

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,660
not just wasn't just coined by the the

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,960
gets B team but it's like this thing

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:02,160
called the content mesh where

00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:06,090
historically things have things CMS's

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:10,180
have all been in one big one big blob

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,430
for everything on take care of and with

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,400
Gatsby there are sort of breaking this

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,200
thing down into only the services you

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,780
need so you can bring them into Gatsby

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,180
and in sort of guess was like a compiled

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,100
target for all those services she wants

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,560
to put together

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,720
but I'm here specifically to talk about

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:34,920
just just getting a data in there so

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:40,270
there's great developer tooling for

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:42,940
Gatsby it's great CLI and it takes care

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,860
of a lot of stuff in the project for you

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:49,450
so before I go any further say some

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,460
blank looks so Gatsby is it's like a

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,960
progressive web app generator that's

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,710
what they call it not a steak site

00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:01,390
generator not like Jack or Hugo it's you

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:02,980
can use reacts in it and code away like

00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,530
you would with that and in when you

00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:08,770
compile it it will compile to stay

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,300
static HTML CSS J's files which you

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,390
could put on a file server somewhere and

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,600
then it will rehydrate the the react

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:19,480
components on the other side for you so

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,650
I just talked about the the tooling for

00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:27,400
Gatsby there is a there's a graticule

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:30,120
data layer so one time bill time or two

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,790
element time it will bring in all of the

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,310
the project files and it was just like a

00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,740
committee of schema so it will just

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:43,660
bring in all that data and you'll be our

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:45,190
access it via a graphical graphic you

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,600
I'll Explorer and you want a graphical

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:52,960
is a couple of pay for cooker call so

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:57,610
gatsby like I said with this graphical

00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,190
Explorer and it lets you shape your your

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,540
data you want so graph QL if you know

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,180
what graphic line is it lets you get

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,070
your data other carts as they say just

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,250
just get a specific bits of data that

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,360
you need for what your component or for

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,070
what if you're working with at that

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,300
point so and it also helps with that

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:22,840
visualization when you're developing

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:28,560
stuff so I'll come on to that so talking

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:32,880
about ap ice gets me laughs ap is so

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,569
emoji so I'm going to be going over

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:44,919
getting a data

00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:48,589
oh my god over look at my notes yeah Wow

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:53,719
okay so they sticking all the notes okay

00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:56,270
yeah cool right so I'm going to talk

00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:58,219
about three ways this isn't the de-facto

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,740
three ways there's many more ways but

00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:03,559
this is the three ways which I usually

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:07,959
do things or you can do things so the

00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:10,879
first one is bill time so a bill time

00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:16,639
like I quickly went over this go back

00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:18,379
back back to our content mesh here so a

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,029
bill time it can bring in all this

00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:27,080
information for you and compile it

00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:30,199
statically so anything which needs to

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,509
have her and to bring in it basically

00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,519
it's not high transactional stuff so

00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,619
this would be I mean you could use it

00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:40,699
for an e-commerce site I know Harry

00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:43,899
Harry's the razorblade company anyway it

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:46,099
they do use it for these guests before

00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:48,819
ecommerce but it's not a high

00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:53,029
transactional thing so it depends on how

00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:55,369
often your data changes because any time

00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:58,009
the data changes you even have to get it

00:07:55,369 --> 00:08:03,199
at runtime or bill time so let's go back

00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:06,169
to those slides yeah the all-time yeah

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,589
so like I say it's the the gatsby day

00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:10,749
Slayer

00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:13,719
and those those guests we've got a

00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:18,490
massive massive ecosystem of plugins

00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:21,289
source plug-ins for things to bring in

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:27,559
any third party information you would

00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:29,779
like and it's a very vibrant and there's

00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:33,050
a lot going on there basically so if you

00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:34,009
want to get basically just check if

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,949
there's a plugin for it it's like a

00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:38,990
catch phrase on my team now they will

00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:42,560
poke fun at me for it and I am

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,000
evangelizing this in my team and to

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,410
punish me they're making me is pre-act

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,980
at the moment

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,399
so I'm happy to talk about it here thank

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,810
you

00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,670
thank you for listening to me ramble

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:58,699
okay so like I said bill time when you

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,470
when you build your projects at that

00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:02,480
time it's when you're bringing in all of

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,839
your information you need and build it

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,779
and then you push off your your built

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,500
site to a CDN somewhere or file server

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:16,310
and if you live your life like that

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:19,579
and then all the networking stuff taken

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,759
care of or something it's not me and

00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:25,370
then that's it your your site is they're

00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:29,240
relatively secure and it can take high

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:32,540
loads and that's it but what you're

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:37,189
thinking is to change so you can at

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:39,170
runtime bring your date originate it and

00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:41,779
there's many ways to I'm just going to

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:45,680
go over one I think to two different

00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:51,589
ways to do it so well who wants to see

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,540
an example so this is just there's a lot

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:55,339
of starters for Gatsby a lot of

00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,819
templates you can use and this is just

00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:11,630
the default starter and I have to get my

00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:12,949
notes up here let's talk about so in

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:16,880
here all right

00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:18,769
right so there's three end points to go

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,730
here we can walk the endpoint there's a

00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:24,620
Spotify endpoint and there's also a coil

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:30,290
or one which I've got listed on here for

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:32,839
some reason so built on Gatsby a bill

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:35,779
Tom does this weird thing with graph you

00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,899
are so I've got a graph QL import here

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:43,490
from Gatsby and a bill time it strips

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:47,389
this out here and it will use that in a

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:49,250
list of Sturm just get back interview so

00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:51,470
guess because this thing where it will

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,680
this is this is a graph query and this

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,799
is also the shape of the data we're

00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,709
going to use to populate our sort of

00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,899
we had to component here so the data

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,939
comes in as props and I'm just

00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:09,699
destructuring the characters from there

00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:14,599
and then mapping over mapping overdose

00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:19,909
in that there and then that gives us our

00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:27,019
built on example and because I am NOT

00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:29,359
managing anything locally so I'm not

00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:34,999
cashing these images so that's why you

00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:38,839
see oh I only in got my hospital right

00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:41,629
that's right for that to connect so they

00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:45,859
should be images and they're not anyway

00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:48,699
moving on right so this is the the

00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:51,529
graphical Explorer you get in Gatsby so

00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:53,209
you go to your local host triple

00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:55,459
underscore forward slash triple

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:58,999
underscore graph QL and this is the

00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:59,959
graph e ql Explorer I don't know where

00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:06,979
the name come from

00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:08,899
sorry and in here the the plugins you

00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:11,749
stop at the start bringing all this data

00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:17,359
so oh you can't see any of it let's just

00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:21,619
move this over a bit how's that much

00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:23,929
better okay so this is this is local

00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:27,289
data or site data looking a you get

00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:31,009
stuff like the pages your 404s this is

00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:34,639
the rick and morty api brought in in

00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:37,069
here's that coin law our data and so

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,689
there's those like metadata loads of

00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:44,029
stuff there you can use throughout your

00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:45,559
projects with this this pan we've got

00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:51,079
going on here so you can appreciate

00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:55,669
stuff out here there there's also a safe

00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:59,599
you've got like a blog or site which has

00:12:55,669 --> 00:13:01,999
loads of pages you can add a template in

00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:03,979
which I'm going to example off sorry but

00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:07,810
if you put you could put a template in

00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:11,140
and in something like guess be node here

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:14,680
you can put in that data and map over it

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,300
and then pushed it out to a template and

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,630
you could party in a variable to the

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:22,210
template and get the the requisite

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:25,830
information you need from your from your

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:30,790
in point for that but that's a bit too

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:34,360
well I'm done it so sorry okay so that's

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:40,150
it bill time so we can do it at run time

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:41,890
right so this is this is the CLI so this

00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,240
is what does all the magic which is

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,730
abstracted away from me we should have

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,360
to deal with so there you go there was

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:54,550
an every day that's why isn't loading

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,940
may be self broken something let's take

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,020
a look

00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,960
failed to extract queries from

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:02,380
components it's possibly because I

00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,850
haven't got a great connection and I

00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:10,270
haven't actually put any error handling

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:12,450
into the so what I'm doing here so what

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:23,770
we've got going on here that's fine

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:25,990
that's a good time well no okay so let's

00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,110
try that one more time this this

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,310
transformative nodes this this would be

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,990
this is just because I've got a terrible

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:37,170
signal on my phone but this would be

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:40,120
where it would bring in a lot of your

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,380
your assets from from your endpoints and

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,190
you start building your site there's

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:48,480
some good plugins for image handling

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:55,180
image compression the site called sharp

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:57,000
good library we're back okay so that's

00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,440
just my terrible reception on my phone

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,280
still uploading these images that's fine

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,770
there we go cool um where was I okay run

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:09,550
times eight oh cool so you've got wait

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:13,029
even longer now because just they are

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,790
here for the bill time that should just

00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:18,790
be there each time apart form for the

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:21,400
these image URLs which hot linking off

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:25,660
to the source where it is but

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:29,110
it's a lot of if the files are local you

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,940
could handle them with there's a lot of

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,920
gastric plugins for handling images and

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,530
compressions that do have all your

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,900
different sizes for different devices

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:40,720
and it was sized them accordingly for

00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:44,770
you but because this is an external

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,650
source and I haven't put any of them

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:53,920
there is a special flake you need to add

00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:58,570
in but sorry okay so the runtime they

00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,610
are example so this is in here let's

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,090
look at that waste loading so you've got

00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:06,040
wrong times later

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:09,430
sort of the same but we're not using

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,010
that weird graph QL bit like we've got

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:16,420
in the the bill times later here because

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:19,440
we are we're pushing our query straight

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:23,770
off to our graphical Island point here

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:27,310
is using in a sink call and we're

00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:34,210
getting some information from this

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:35,530
spotify endpoint so that will take take

00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,530
a while each time whenever you load that

00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:42,420
access to go off get the data come back

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:45,840
and populate it so the there is the

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:48,340
drawback is you're doing it at runtime

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,180
but you've got the you know we've got

00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,340
the header here

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,650
we could have sidebar lots of our

00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,870
information surrounding it so the

00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,640
perception is that it's not slow but

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,070
you're just waiting for some of the data

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:05,310
to come in and I want a 3G connection

00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:09,130
here so it looks atrocious so so that's

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:13,030
runtime data fetching and yeah I mean

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:15,220
this is why it's like you know when you

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:20,740
haven't got 3G and 5g all the time so

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:22,720
there you go okay so we can also mix

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:27,570
those two together so you can build time

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:33,310
and runtimes later so here this is the

00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:34,480
the coin law REST API but I have brought

00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:40,049
this in too

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:42,910
gasps be at bill time so here you can

00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:46,510
you can create source loads and you

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:50,100
could bring in a date you want and like

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,870
I said it's the the the the guess B

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,910
schema is very permissive so it'll bring

00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:58,480
in that data and populate it best it can

00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:03,549
in your sort of your your scheme you've

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,429
got which you're working with so that is

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:09,580
that's that's a bill time but we can

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:11,799
also do this at run time as well so you

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,290
can get a sort of mixture of the two

00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:18,340
so where are we with mixed data runtime

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:20,730
mixed data here we go okay so and this

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:26,380
comes to the thing where I spoke about

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:29,380
so that's like two minutes where I spoke

00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,150
about if you're theta changes how'd you

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,950
know to update you could do it this way

00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,260
where you could have your build time

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,679
data depending on how many times a day

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,450
your site is built

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:44,290
you can either trigger trigger a build

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,990
via or see our city process or have it

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:49,480
on a cron job and how if you won't do it

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:54,070
so at the moment if we if we go back

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:57,220
here because the was what was this hat -

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:59,010
it was a one because the date is older

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,890
than one minute it's going to go off and

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:04,120
get that information each time which is

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:09,309
a lot faster than that graphic on

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:12,450
endpoint so four minutes so if we say

00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:14,830
five minutes here and then hit refresh

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,780
it's just got its got the biltong there

00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:20,200
so i'm hitting refresh here and it's

00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:24,760
just having the data which is local if I

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:29,890
say three hit refresh again it'll go off

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:32,320
and get that data so there's there is it

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:36,610
is possible to have both you know what's

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,799
a real time data but very you know

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:44,260
current data on your on your on your

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:45,020
projects so there's two ways doing it

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,940
how did I do

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,929
did anyone work to go into detail on how

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:55,640
that happened or y'all just saw glazed

00:19:50,929 --> 00:20:02,900
over and Twain to go home cool

00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:06,850
brilliant so that's that's it for that

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:10,460
really let's go back to the slides

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,870
so yeah oh sorry the graphic list boy

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:18,740
dude I don't want to take a look at this

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:20,710
so that bill time guess we know it will

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,550
go off and get this information here and

00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:28,220
it'll put it into coin law so we've got

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:30,140
the schemer put it in his all coil or

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:35,570
corner because I can't think of a good

00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:38,570
name for it I don't in here this is

00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:40,809
where we can shape the data we want from

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:45,530
[Music]

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:48,470
from our endpoint so fql it's got quite

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,780
good Explorer and I think that was a

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:54,559
great one to use

00:20:49,780 --> 00:21:00,380
so forgot your nodes here and then take

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:04,010
a look at what we've got data sends back

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:11,390
sounds I love syncing it

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:14,500
I know a symbol name name okay so over

00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:20,210
here this is how we would get the data

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:24,110
back into our project and if we take a

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:29,809
look at where it is on the page so this

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:37,040
is built see it's mixed it is so I'm

00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:38,330
using nothing on this side and we're

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,679
going and we're going to risk doing some

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:48,369
live coding

00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:52,599
right so let's put it in here and then

00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:53,999
we'll just put this at the bottom so

00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:56,949
sorry I didn't go through what was

00:21:53,999 --> 00:22:05,829
happening with this just got like a lay

00:21:56,949 --> 00:22:10,449
out the time difference god I mean which

00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:11,859
is using well just using some

00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:15,099
conditional staff to say whether we

00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:18,969
should render the the local data or the

00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:20,619
stuff from the API I mean I was going to

00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:25,779
at the bottom here just putting this

00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:29,799
dump component okay and props what do we

00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:43,899
want in here call or data

00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:49,559
try it cool cool cool cool so so yeah

00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:53,769
okay so down here we've got this is how

00:22:49,559 --> 00:23:00,729
we get our data from our graphic Orion

00:22:53,769 --> 00:23:02,529
point so it's it's very similar i mean

00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:06,190
i've putting a lot more soar properties

00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:09,249
here to get back but it's exactly the
