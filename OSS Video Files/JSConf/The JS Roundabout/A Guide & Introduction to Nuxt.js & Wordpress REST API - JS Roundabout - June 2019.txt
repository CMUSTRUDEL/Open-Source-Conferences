	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,639
I'm gonna talk about headless CMS's

00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,250
although you're more reactive people so

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,269
I'm gonna try and steer away from view

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,210
and knocks as much as I can

00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:22,500
who knows about headless CMS's yeah who

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,920
uses them kind of okay so headless CMS

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:30,500
is like WordPress is for you know

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,270
old-school front-end but it doesn't like

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,710
it doesn't control the front and anymore

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,770
so you still have the ability to give

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:45,629
your editors access to your website to

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:48,059
your CMS but they manage the content and

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,850
let's say they don't actually serve

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,770
anything on the front end what you do is

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,230
you give the control of the front and

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,410
single page application or you know a

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,270
server-side application or just a

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:05,939
JavaScript application in general and

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:10,500
you you kind of take information from

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:16,680
the headless CMS via rest api's or graph

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:21,830
QL if you can so I'm gonna skip

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:26,820
ooh am some gifts my experience with

00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:29,820
headless CMS starts with migration from

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,970
angularjs 1.5 which is a great framework

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,540
I'm joking

00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:39,450
and this is kind of my reaction very

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:45,380
simplified because it happened way more

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:47,640
strongly and you know emphatically but

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:52,399
I'm not gonna talk upon axe I'm gonna

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,860
show the gifts for a while and basically

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:59,310
angular is an MVC framework so you have

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,880
Model View controller and lots of places

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,310
where things talk with each other and I

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,239
don't like that because it seems like

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,250
you're writing Java and we're front-end

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,240
people we're lazy we don't want to do

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,480
that so

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:22,000
we we decided to go with you mostly

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,010
because I decided and no one knew more

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,010
than me at that point so it was lucky

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,470
because I wanted to work with you but

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,900
again this is applicable to react as

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,650
well which I'm working on now anyway

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:39,790
so what the CMS is I'm gonna actually

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:44,200
open a live example don't copy my

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,910
password please okay

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,390
no one is connected to this public Wi-Fi

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,390
I'm sure

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:55,750
okay so we have WordPress probably most

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,110
of you are familiar with WordPress okay

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:02,140
I'm gonna assume that but I've

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,640
effectively got our dashboard on on here

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,750
that's the main page and then you got

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:11,920
post you got custom posts pages and then

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:15,070
some settings and stuff with WordPress

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,000
the first of all WordPress is free ok so

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:22,330
if you want to use a contentful or you

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,570
know Prisma core whoever CMS for free

00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,850
they have a ratio limit so if you not

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,520
too careful and they people keep asking

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,560
about those gifts they are gonna hit

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:36,070
that limit and it's gonna be a problem

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,230
in you have to pay so with WordPress you

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:45,190
don't although it's not as fast

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:47,230
of course it's WordPress PHP but you

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,270
have custom fields this is a plug-in

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,660
it's a free plug-in there is a better

00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:55,060
version but it's not much better but the

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,340
free plugin allows you to create custom

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:02,280
fields for each page so you can specify

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:04,630
title which is a text you know field and

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,170
you know you have other stuff like

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:10,630
images and repeating lists and flexible

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:14,530
content and dynamic so you can literally

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:16,840
if you wanted you could create CMS with

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,530
a you know design system that you can

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:23,080
the editor says okay I want this you

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,000
know banner on the homepage they click

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,510
it and they write the text and they're

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,880
happy

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:31,270
and and you showed a banner in the front

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,060
end but that's Jason fire basically it's

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,990
just a JSON response so that's good it's

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:40,180
free again I want to stress that

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,400
literally you can build a static site or

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,100
state for free or neckla Phi and ever

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,740
free WordPress CMS well you have to pay

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,390
the hosting for WordPress but hey no no

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,370
one's perfect all you could you know

00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:55,150
spin up your computer leave it on and

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:59,920
bless your server if you want to go for

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:02,620
really free or VPN or so you got your

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:07,950
JSON requests and then I'm gonna go to

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:11,080
the or press front-end it's fast

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:14,710
I'm joking now is the the one that you

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:18,900
showed before the 83% so you can see

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:22,800
that I'm refreshing the page here and

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:26,770
xhr so first of all you don't see h8

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,710
HTTP requests here there is this content

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:34,960
CSS is coming from again an extension

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:37,210
but there is no no request here made for

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,350
the on page there are some service

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:44,950
workers going on but effectively all the

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:48,430
content is static so if I you know check

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:53,070
the HTML everything is there

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:57,250
I can resource where can I have users

00:05:53,070 --> 00:06:04,510
never mind there should be a view source

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:08,350
here right you see there you go okay so

00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:10,180
resource this is the critical CSS don't

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,240
be scared this is because this is a

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,520
static site and got some CSS there but

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,490
this is effectively less than one

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,680
kilobyte and then you go some minified

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,620
HTML which looks horrible but

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,270
effectively you can see here that's a

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:29,950
content and it's server-side rendered

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:33,280
but it looks prettier here so let's look

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:38,020
at this you can see got some sections

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,730
here it's a fairly small site but we got

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:45,720
components here we go

00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:48,850
face we've got you know some sliders and

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,490
other components so all this is lazy

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:55,930
loaded so you gonna see whatever I

00:06:51,490 --> 00:07:02,230
scroll let me just refresh this disable

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:05,200
cache yeah so I'm scrolling and you can

00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,780
see like stuff appearing and that's

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,370
loading the images that's loading

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,680
another image

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:15,160
whenever I scroll down that happens

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,710
right so this is where I was just meta

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,320
meta doing the talk now I'm referring to

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:23,710
the previous talk about lazy loading and

00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:26,170
you know loading less is more your kind

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,550
of loading the least amount possible so

00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:33,250
literally just this image and this text

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:37,419
but the text itself is coming from an

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:41,110
API eventually the site is static but

00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:46,660
it's generated once right so if we look

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:48,430
at this page while there is no API ok

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:53,380
well it's completely static I'm

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:55,120
impressed but to be honest I thought

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,160
that was an API call here but let's go

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,820
to contact page I'm sure there is a are

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,100
there he's nice so here is the response

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,169
from WordPress he's saying okay I got

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:09,580
you know the content the title of the

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:10,360
page they go ID whoever dies title type

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,180
and stuff

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,610
and then you got a CF here that a CF is

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,479
the custom field so you can see title I

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:22,840
got some SEO meta tags background image

00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:26,320
which is that that be over there so this

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:29,350
is effectively a free CMS can do that

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:34,089
and in order to do that you have to just

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:38,800
call an API which is this so if actively

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:40,810
if I copy this link here you get the

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,120
response back if we see it's a get

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:46,660
request you could put it like an

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:51,620
authenticated request if you wanted but

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:54,420
I got caching on WordPress so okay

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,430
and that's effectively all you need so

00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,579
you got the ACF you can work with that

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:02,940
object and if you had graph QL you could

00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:05,459
just load this object here but the rest

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:09,959
API actually spits out the whole page so

00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:12,089
that's a downer but yet you got all the

00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,620
you know background image all the sizes

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:15,870
from WordPress you don't have to buy

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,269
cloud in area accounts for this it just

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,550
gives you the whole the sizes you need

00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:25,259
and then you know some other stuff that

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:29,959
you customized like SEO so effectively

00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:35,069
the Edler CMS is allowing you to

00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:37,860
abstract the the layer the view layer

00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:40,860
from the logic and from the content side

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,470
so what the logic is still in your

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,589
front-end but the content comes from the

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,569
headless CMS so why that is important

00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:52,079
well imagine you're in a corporation

00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:54,389
like voila phone and you you have to go

00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,939
to your editors to say okay I want to

00:09:54,389 --> 00:10:00,750
change this banner for you know the

00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:03,089
latest offer without headless CMS you

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,509
have to go actually in the code change a

00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:08,639
or you know even if you have a content

00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:11,069
management the you can change it but

00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,870
then you have to test whether the change

00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,670
is going to break stuff but here you

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,339
have control of the front and completely

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,170
so you whatever the data is you can

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,019
either cash it or you can you know

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:29,630
accept a new stuff and update which is

00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:34,050
really powerful I think so next is a

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:37,649
server-side framework on top of you why

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,709
I think he's better than react now I'm

00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:42,809
joking everything is Knox is based on

00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:45,509
next J's which is the react counterpart

00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:50,250
although they are much better but again

00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:53,069
not biased but you can see well you can

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,720
if i zoom in these are all the chunks

00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,500
that it creates automatically you don't

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,500
have to do that yourself because max is

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,240
beautiful so every page you create it

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,939
will lazy load it and split

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,389
and you can see pages destination here

00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:13,170
privacy policy who needs that you know

00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:17,929
and the app itself is 76 kilobytes which

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:20,339
is you know much less than what react

00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:23,369
normally does if you don't know optimize

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,949
it and you can see here this is bundle

00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:28,649
webpack bundle analyzer but there are

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:30,920
other applications that do that you can

00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:35,519
see all the chunks here the layouts

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,769
pages so this is really it takes away

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,929
the abstraction from you if you are not

00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:42,749
really expert on you know performance

00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:46,199
you can still kind of achieve a decent

00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:49,050
size and decent bundle size just by

00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:51,800
loading one of these frameworks which I

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:56,279
suggest you know someone to try cuz

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,709
they're really magic but coming back to

00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:05,220
the you know application and headless

00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:09,509
EMS this is loaded so everything here is

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:12,749
not loaded and this part here the common

00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:17,040
and app is loaded on on the first load

00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:21,149
what happened is this wiper here if you

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,699
see here he's loaded in the main bundle

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,709
so what I've done following those

00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:28,350
practices that we saw before is that I

00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:32,339
took this wiper j/s which is the slider

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:35,699
bit and I moved up into a lazy loaded

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:37,799
component so that chunk here is gonna go

00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:40,439
away is going to go over here in one of

00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:43,740
these files were the index page is

00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:45,749
basically and then that huge chunk of

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:50,369
code is gonna disappear from my bundles

00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:52,980
so that is 50k gzipped more more or less

00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:56,220
that I'm saving and that might not be

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,399
much for a desktop but it surely is for

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:02,269
my you know nexus free G with a

00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,970
four-time slowdown apparently so that

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:09,389
was at least 20% of the speed

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:14,699
improvements plus the other stuff that I

00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:15,860
mentioned so one way to start with this

00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:18,199
is to

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,209
even if you don't choose WordPress you

00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:24,220
there are lots of you know free accounts

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:27,309
for Atlas CMS's like I think Prisma and

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:32,709
what was the other one

00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:32,709
contentful yes you're listening nice

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,129
yeah so all these CMS is I have a free

00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,639
free tier that you can kind of develop

00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:43,489
on and try things out and they really

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:48,319
are powerful and a good addition to any

00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:51,019
kind of mid to high tier company but

00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:53,720
effectively they work similar to

00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:55,579
WordPress does but they have kind of

00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,249
custom fields built in so you don't have

00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:02,299
to buy or install the plugins or

00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:04,100
yourself but this effectively is doable

00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:06,439
with any framework so it could be

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,949
JavaScript by itself it's just an API

00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:12,709
call right so you go to you know your

00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:15,709
contact page you load the JSON for that

00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:18,379
Condor page you get a preview you see

00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:22,339
okay I have a CF field and then I do a

00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:25,220
CF dot background dot image and I'm

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:28,970
gonna load it that's all so this is

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,069
really good for handing over websites if

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,809
you're a freelancer or you know if you

00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:34,939
have a big company you can just give it

00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:38,029
to the editor team and they can do their

00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:39,829
own magic to the content while you just

00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:42,769
care about the performance and the

00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:44,779
front-end and the style which is all you

00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:46,819
should you really need to care about

00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:50,290
rather than just changing that line of

00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:57,139
text every two weeks

00:14:50,290 --> 00:15:00,129
yeah that's let me just zoom out because

00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:06,799
there is a nice gift yeah

00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:09,110
he's impressed so what is SSR just

00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,809
briefly before I close if you really

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,669
want to go down this route not knacks

00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:16,429
could be next or it could be just you

00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:19,279
just trying server-side rendering by

00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:22,369
itself don't don't try server-side

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,110
rendering by yourself because it's super

00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:27,589
complex you have to know about nodejs

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:30,079
about you know hydration and all these

00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,749
things so I suggest starting with a

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,839
framework and then slowly going down to

00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:38,649
how it works behind the scenes one thing

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,569
to note is that if you have a client

00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:43,639
application and a server they all need

00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:46,100
to render at the same time or more or

00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,980
less the server runs first of course and

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,019
then it spits out some HTML that the

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,559
browser is going to read but they have

00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:57,829
to match so if you are loading a slider

00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,410
that relies on window object or document

00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:02,389
and be careful because this is probably

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,360
specific but it's going to appear for

00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:08,929
you as well you're gonna say okay I see

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,669
a DVR by is now in the client or vice

00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:13,579
versa is not on the server but it's in

00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:15,919
the client so what's going on and of

00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:17,899
course the window might be the problem

00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,669
or maybe you haven't closed attack

00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:23,449
properly and the server doesn't know

00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:26,449
what to do so that's quite important if

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:28,279
you see that you have kind of a matching

00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:30,889
content from where you render them from

00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:34,699
what you see in the client remember that

00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:35,539
window is not on node so you need to do

00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:37,819
that

00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:40,819
no live demo because I showed you before

00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:43,069
I have a repo year this is not specific

00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:45,589
I created like a boilerplate

00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:48,019
if you want to try you can install it

00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:50,509
and you spin off our WordPress even

00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:52,369
locally and you can kind of fetch your

00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:57,499
content from there it's kind of almost

00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:59,689
ready to go for life which is going to

00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:02,860
be in the slide link if you're

00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:06,880
interested cool thank you then

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,880
