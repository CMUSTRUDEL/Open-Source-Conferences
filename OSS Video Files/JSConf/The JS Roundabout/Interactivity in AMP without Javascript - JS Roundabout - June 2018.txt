Title: Interactivity in AMP without Javascript - JS Roundabout - June 2018
Publication date: 2018-06-18
Playlist: The JS Roundabout
Description: 
	Presented by Sanjay Purswani of Compare the Market.

Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is a Google project that aims to make the web fast by default, and one of the ways it wants to do that is by restricting user-authored JavaScript. Itâ€™s gaining too much popularity and solves too many problems for us to ignore as front-enders and web-developers - Sanjay's talk will explore how we can achieve the same interactivity and personalisation without JavaScript.
