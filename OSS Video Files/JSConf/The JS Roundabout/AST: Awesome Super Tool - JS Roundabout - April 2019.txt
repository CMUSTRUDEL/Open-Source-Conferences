It’s always good to understand how things work under the hood. Not only because it allows you to understand how to properly use things or how things may fail, but also to add that knowledge to your toolkit when needing to solve a problem.

How does Babel work? And ESLint? What about Prettier? Oh, and codemods? They all share a common concept which will unlock a world of possibilities if you understand it: the AST (stands for Abstract Syntax Tree).

Let’s learn a bit about yet another acronym, in order to learn how we can use it to bend the code to our will, and also have fun experimenting.
