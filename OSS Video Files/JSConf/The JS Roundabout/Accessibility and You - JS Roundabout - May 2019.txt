Title: Accessibility and You - JS Roundabout - May 2019
Publication date: 2019-05-24
Playlist: The JS Roundabout
Description: 
	Presented by Ben Read, Web Developer.

Abstract: When we build for accessibility in JavaScript applications we can positively impact our project and our objectives. Here's a closer look at some of the results that come from an accessible website, and some ideas about what steps you can take today to encourage best practices in your team.

thank you great to be here nice to see

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,099
you all so I got invited to a party of

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,679
the day yes well well I wasn't all my

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,240
friends were and they had a good time

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,089
and I wasn't invited so how would you

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,100
feel if that was you would you be

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,060
forgiving and say well maybe they just

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,460
forgot about me

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,740
next time would be alright I would you

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,500
say there's people out there I've better

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,670
people to spend my time with well let's

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,730
see what happens when we don't have

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,920
access to something that other people do

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,120
it's an equal isn't it it feels like

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,570
there's a bit imbalance there then

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,180
people can miss out and a lot can happen

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,489
when you don't have access and think of

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,739
a person who can't pay a bill because

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,629
they can't access the service they need

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,250
to in order to do that let's think about

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,750
somebody who's cut off and their friends

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,100
or family because they don't access

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,020
they're not able to access the social

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,000
network that their friends do

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,280
so there's a lot of things that can

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,210
happen because a person doesn't have

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,940
access and that's what we're talking

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,230
about isn't it access accessibility so

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,760
we're going to just look at three things

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,020
and a little bit is covered by what Jamm

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,130
already said but just to recap on that

00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,860
we're going to cover this what is

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,040
accessibility how involves us you and me

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,020
as JavaScript developers today and what

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,549
we can do some we probably had some very

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,540
good practical points but some other

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,350
things that we can perhaps act on today

00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,920
so we're just going to look at that

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,560
first point first what is accessibility

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,020
or teaching is to show things by

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,670
contrast isn't it something that we we

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,409
say it's not like this but it is like

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,970
that right so we're going to do is look

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,500
at accessibility through that lens a

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,540
minute here so this is what excessively

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,610
is not it is not this website is 100%

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,200
accessible if we if we're doing that

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,799
then that's fantastic that is a major

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,720
step and it shows that we really care

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,780
but it's not just a tick list of things

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,939
we can do and can't do and and some

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,950
people say well well why bother if we

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,369
can't have a 100% accessible website

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,070
well why why try in the first place well

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,770
we could say in Contra in reply to that

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,840
well you can't have a 100% secure web

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,489
site can you well you can it's just you

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,560
can't actually publish it on the web

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,870
so if you

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,940
we don't stop trying to do that do we we

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,370
always try to make our sites secure as

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,440
possible because we know that our users

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,030
need that security we know that would be

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,040
letting people down if it's not as

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,650
secure as it can be and it's the same

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,600
with accessibility I feel that we still

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,730
try our best to reach that one hundred

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,970
percent mark it is not something that we

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,260
can tick off and say we've done it

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,380
unfortunately it's not like that it's a

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,870
bit more complex but we still want to

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,900
try don't we we still want to to try our

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,360
best to do that and another thing that

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,130
I've heard is that we don't need to

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,739
build for accessibility because

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,570
statistically so few people use screen

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,739
readers that we don't need to build for

00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:00,269
them but that doesn't really hold water

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:03,060
we're not talking about whether or not

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,260
people can use our site we're talking

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,760
about whether they have access to

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,380
something if for instance we might use

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,010
that reasoning when we think about ie6

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,810
we don't support ie6 right because but

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,640
those people who use ie6 have a choice

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,910
or the companies that employ them have a

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,470
choice but people who need different

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,420
accessibility tools I need an accessible

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,670
website they don't have the choice do

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,920
they that's what they're given that's

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,810
what they have and so a range of

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,090
abilities of people a different spectrum

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,000
of humankind with different abilities

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,310
and needs is a fact and so we should

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,049
include them as well but what is

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,799
excessively today we look to what it's

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:45,750
not what is it in contrast to that I

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,400
really like this quote and was quoted in

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,250
an article by Ethan Marcotte who

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,160
published just earlier this week and

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,560
he's quotes Liz Jackson who said it's an

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,890
opportunity I really like that framing

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,290
don't you an opportunity an opportunity

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,510
to engage people who doesn't want to

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,100
talk to the people that use our services

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,350
in our apps who doesn't want to find out

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,359
what they think how they use it what

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,220
they need from it how can we improve it

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,989
how can we make it better it's an

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,600
opportunity to learn from these people

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,669
so that we can benefit them because

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,079
remember as Jamm said when we build

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,989
accessible sites we're not just building

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,140
for for one set of needs we're building

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:27,370
for all right and we're expanding the

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,590
scope of our apps our services to reach

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,520
more people who doesn't want that it's a

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,610
great opportunity

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,590
I just want to tackle something that

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,770
I've heard recently in my Twitter feed

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:41,770
Twitter it's great for arguing isn't it

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:45,370
but we've I've heard that JavaScript

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,380
developers often get pulled up on this

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,840
and say we're not great at accessibility

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,900
we don't focus on it we're not that good

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,350
at it and I don't think that's quite

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,520
true

00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,520
I think there's so much that we've got

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,680
to think about type safety tests even

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,300
our CEO 8i tools for to us as JavaScript

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,020
dwell oppose these days don't they loads

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,460
of things to think about but we also

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,310
need to think about accessibility as

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:12,100
well for example if we wouldn't ship

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,110
with a poor test coverage if we wouldn't

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,910
assign any to all of our variables

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,199
we'd experience across an application we

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,300
don't want to do that do we we don't

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,740
want to let our teams down we don't want

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,740
to let our companies down and we don't

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,050
let it let our users down but we also

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,820
don't want to let other users down we

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,580
don't let it want to let down other

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:34,090
customers by not making sites accessible

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:37,000
for them as well so what is isn't

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,370
accessibility it's not a checklist but

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,789
it's an opportunity if we can engage our

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,490
users we can really benefit from their

00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:47,410
view of what we have built and help them

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,080
and help ourselves as well and help our

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,870
organizations that we work for so we've

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:58,090
seen what accessibility is now let's see

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:59,530
how we are involved I came across this

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,479
quote the other day any society is

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,849
judged on the basis of how it treats is

00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,979
we're weakest members how are we doing

00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:08,020
on that now I do have issue with this

00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:10,750
word weakest I don't think that people

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,000
with accessibility needs are a weak but

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:16,090
they have different situations to us

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,580
different circumstances in life maybe

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,530
they are feel marginalized or they don't

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,810
have representation or they don't feel

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,060
that they identify with those who do

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,270
represent them so the only weakness

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:31,300
really is in what we create you know we

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,860
we are JavaScript developers we actually

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,960
have a privileged position don't we we

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,390
create the world around us you know

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,550
people thinking even is being changed

00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,020
based on what they see in front of one

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,490
what the apps they use every day

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,590
it's changing the way that people think

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,449
on that level which is immense power if

00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,910
you think about it so we have that

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:52,840
privilege how we're going to use it are

00:06:48,910 --> 00:07:01,449
we going to serve and help weakest

00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:02,949
members of our society as well so yeah

00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,770
and it's not just that as well

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,569
at some point in time we could become

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,949
disadvantage our circumstances could

00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:11,110
change we could find ourselves in a

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,930
different situation that we don't face

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:18,069
now and it could impact how we use our

00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:20,409
services that we've built for example it

00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,979
hands up if you have kids here anybody

00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:23,229
have kids

00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:26,919
anybody have more than more than one kid

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:28,509
to keep your hands up three okay it's

00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,979
hard work isn't it it's really difficult

00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:31,960
to navigate the internet when you're

00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:34,330
nursing your baby because it's not just

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,860
about tap sizess then it's about how

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,900
you're getting around with scrolling

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,460
with your thumb with your nose and it

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,020
can become really difficult so isn't it

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,000
great that we've got thumb sizes now to

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,620
help us navigate but see by doing that

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,479
by building four different thumbs sizes

00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,370
we've also helped other users in

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,380
different circumstances right to get

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,150
around our apps and our services and

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,360
that was just a temporary thing right my

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,710
kids have grown up a little bit now but

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,279
but that was the situation I had for a

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,180
little while

00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,740
not easy lots of nose packing and what

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,240
about if you have a broken arm or a

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,889
broken leg something that stops you from

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,630
using things the way that you aren't you

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:09,250
are used to it comes more difficult

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,979
doesn't it you have to adapt you have to

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:14,110
change how you use something and we have

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:18,430
to we might have to adapt how we use the

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:20,770
internet as well so now we are strong

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,270
now we might be able but that's not all

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,340
maybe not always going to be the case

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,900
how awful would it be to realize too

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,909
late that you could have built something

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,909
that you need now and a better way so

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,039
yeah those are thinking oh yeah so

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,020
that's our second section sorry I had to

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,599
email my notes to me so we are involved

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,789
we are privileged because we are

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,709
developers we owner we can share what we

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,410
know we can we can really build for

00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:49,600
accessibility but we are involved in the

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,459
situation if we're not now then somebody

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,660
we love might be or know or we might be

00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:54,660
in the future as well

00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:01,720
okay so the second or third section what

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,350
can we do to improve access now we can

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,759
become a voice we can speak up if we

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,550
notice that there's not some there's

00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:11,199
something that could be improved for

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,850
examples that's great work on that PR I

00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:14,199
really loved your code but I noticed you

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,730
didn't define a focus state on that

00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:17,410
button perhaps we ought to do that

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,500
before we merge this code that kind of

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,449
thing and we can also raise the issue in

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,970
our organization for example the

00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:26,290
financial conduct authority has this

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,449
principle that we should treat customers

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,670
fairly so that means that we should have

00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:32,139
concern about the accessibility of our

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,899
sites and our apps and our products and

00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:38,079
the things that we offer to people we

00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,579
can also follow these people I'm sure

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,250
I've missed a load outright I'm sure you

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,680
know many more but this is a couple that

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,279
I like in a follow quite often is Laura

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,810
Kalibak

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,690
and her book accessibility for everyone

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:52,269
I hate in Pickering he wrote inclusive

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,389
divine design patterns great resource

00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:59,350
for practical application Leonia Watson

00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:02,920
who Jam mentions really good Molly watt

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,209
and the web I am and Sarah Sweden is

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,370
actually holding a workshop on

00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:08,370
accessibility later this month as well

00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,189
but the main thing is I guess I want to

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,810
convey to you is that we should be

00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:16,389
concerned that we want to build for

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,939
everyone build for the whole spectrum of

00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:25,180
human experience and not just our own um

00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:27,459
yeah so accessibility includes all of us

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,490
doesn't it so you've seen this evening

00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:32,350
what is accessibility so it's not a

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,149
checklist but it is an opportunity to

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,339
engage our users we've seen how it

00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:38,110
involves us in our circumstances because

00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:39,970
we have that position of shaping the

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,620
world around us or an amazing thing that

00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,420
is and how we can use it to benefit

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,750
everybody and we've seen a little bit of

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,060
what we can do today to help everybody

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,769
to access our site so yes

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,439
we create the future with the things

00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:55,360
that we build accessibility is about you

00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:57,639
and me as JavaScript developers today

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,889
it's part of what we create and it's

00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:03,050
also our legacy so accessibility is

00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:05,110
about us thank you

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,110
