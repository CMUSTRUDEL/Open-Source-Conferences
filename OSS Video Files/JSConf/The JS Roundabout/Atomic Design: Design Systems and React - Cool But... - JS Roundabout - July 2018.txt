	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,529
we're going to talk about guess what

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,089
that we design and react so we're going

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,480
to talk about Design Systems react

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,340
cosmos which is our Design Systems but I

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,099
focus a little bit on the bat of the

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,780
atomic design and some conclusions

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,050
I'll try so you will see some

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,820
repetitions of previous talks but also

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,260
some differences so maybe we can discuss

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,080
about the difference is the different

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,660
point of view versus atomic design so

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,349
hello I'm Italian by the way so do you

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:35,100
see that do you see the pattern here

00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:37,950
boom okay and I worked for badoo badoo

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,200
is I work as UI engineer in the mobile

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,170
web team so this means a browser in a

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,390
mobile device every possible browser

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,020
every possible device every possible

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:52,410
solution and badou ism or now nearly 400

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,629
million users worldwide and we call the

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,140
possible platform so iOS Android mobile

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:01,949
web desktop web and up to a few months

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,449
ago also Windows Phone again I work in

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:07,920
the mobile web team we are not hiring

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:10,680
surprised some concept about design

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,530
system probably you already heard about

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,330
it okay this is the classic components

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,340
clear cool ok how do you use components

00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,840
classic use the components Lego classic

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,369
you build the library with the library

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,799
this is the point you can build

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,650
different pages or different apps so

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,049
that's the main idea ok cool but what is

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,360
a design system where the system is like

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,689
a cake okay you have your UI components

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,939
but they can stay in a get report then

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,500
what do you do you use them okay but

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,970
then you need to add documentation as

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,310
soon as you add documentation you have a

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,890
style guide so you explain how to use

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,110
them but even if you build them you're

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,520
missing out people and process so how

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,619
you have to involve people and it you

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,600
have to design a process about around

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,130
the fact that how you use components how

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,590
you update components how do you release

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,420
new component how people interact inside

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,659
the company and so on and this is a

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,009
design system cool actually no it's even

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,379
more complex because this involves

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,749
documentation content strategy brain

00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,939
design principles and so on so it's a

00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:16,150
it's a very complex system and this is

00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:18,849
the classic golden definition of a

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,739
design system by noting Kurtis what I

00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:22,480
want to stress is that a design system

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:25,120
is a product so this means source with a

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,469
backlog but it's not a product per se it

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,510
needs to serve something else an

00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:30,340
ecosystem which is the list of products

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,840
the company and so on we don't build

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,989
design system just for the sake of

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,180
building design systems every company

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,919
nowadays it is a system or less have you

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,200
seen and the benefits are clear there is

00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,150
a spoke about it

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,319
consistency better line alignment of

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,359
process between design development

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,909
better efficiency you believe in the

00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:50,980
commentation you start to have something

00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:52,900
more important which is communication

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,879
collaboration within the company but

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,109
sometimes can also use for marketing

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,269
branding and hiring

00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,980
oh this is my cool design system can

00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:03,129
work for me and that's how you feel when

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,689
you add in a system yep

00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:07,000
if you want to know more there is the

00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:08,620
this presentation I made I remember like

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,889
two years ago there is everything about

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:17,349
Design Systems and so ok welcomes react

00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:17,949
in this part well everything was

00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,560
possible

00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:22,720
everything started a few years ago when

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,189
the idea of this atomic design by Brad

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,780
first like was combined with idea web

00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:31,120
components this is the classic web

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,970
components not react not anything but

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,290
there was this idea of components and

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,629
this will come later this idea of

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,780
composition you compose elements to

00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:42,970
obtain something else ok and this

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,069
started to be a common ground as we saw

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,479
between design and developers so bizarre

00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,909
design lead developer they start to use

00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,500
the same word card for the same

00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,909
component and so all the

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,939
misunderstanding that there was before

00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:57,280
was mitigated by this use of the same

00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:00,150
semantic names for the same object and

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,819
react made everything more simpler

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,069
possibly or streamlined and so on and

00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:08,500
now is predominant like this is one of

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:10,389
the like repository where you can find

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,189
like the list of the biggest if you want

00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:14,560
design system across the world and so on

00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:16,959
you can clearly see like the big part

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,199
are built in reactor or no frameworks at

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,700
all which means essentially just uses

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,770
some in vanilla some multiples

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,560
and so on if you want to know more about

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,830
this interesting relation between design

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,240
and coding and development there's this

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,190
amazing article by Mark Douglas

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,680
explaining a lot also about the new

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:40,660
tools that there we are starting to

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:45,310
think in terms of or generating the code

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,710
from the design tools which will not

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,930
happen or the other way around so use

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,820
the code to generate the mocks inside

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,750
the design tools so the designer the

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:57,610
design using code ascension cosmos

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,400
cosmos is our design system I can share

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,350
a little bit it's not public so we have

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,540
the classic list of components you can

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:10,090
search for components like we have the

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,950
core components if you see we support

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,560
multiple teams multiple brands we call

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,690
it but also multiple platform above this

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,120
is like the typography we have different

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:23,560
type Arabic Styles classic iconography

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,050
this we will see maybe in a moment this

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,280
component called avatar with a break

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,810
which is used a lot in our application

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,450
the classic button with all the possible

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,890
violent of colors stays if you see here

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,750
we have different states for the button

00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,670
so there is a visual representation but

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,590
if you see the check the size of the

00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:45,820
button changes across different platform

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:50,710
and here the input all the classic

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:53,440
shebang of a different system no it's

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,270
not even public and with the toggle you

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,890
can see the code below but also you can

00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,500
see all the documentation about a

00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,450
component API about how to use it and

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,550
there is another one which is called

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:06,040
player who's in a second so again the

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,740
API of the buttons but in the playground

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,540
you can play let's say change the

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,540
properties alive and see the button

00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,460
change in front of you directly and you

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,110
can even input the code here and you

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,910
will see the changes and this is a way

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,520
also to allow other people to understand

00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,410
the API of the the component if you are

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,070
a developer or if you are a designer see

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:28,390
the the state of this a component let's

00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:32,000
talk about a little bit about the code

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:36,650
base as I told you is built in reactor

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,290
we use sass and Bama notation we don't

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:43,810
use any J as in CSS for the moment

00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:46,610
because there's no big need it's not

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,010
essentially the once you have broken

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,600
down to small components it's the cost

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,990
of changing from one technology to

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,880
another is so small that once we will

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,910
find the need to switch to I don't know

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,530
sty components or CSS modules we will do

00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,050
probably in one day of work so we don't

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,880
find the need of of it this is it for

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,520
the structure of our project essentially

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,250
we have three different thus a big rip

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,050
knot is one single report by the way and

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,490
we don't version the single components

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,800
we have only versioning for the entire

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,660
repo and we have designed tokens imagine

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,560
like JSON they store the information

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,700
about one component sorry about designs

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,590
information like badou all the colors

00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,960
but then you have like the button you

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,970
can have different button size for

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,490
different platforms and also imagine

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:35,540
like the description of the core

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,700
principle you call them particles okay

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,400
the particles of your design system then

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,830
you have the components built in react

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,870
again flat flat structure as he

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,590
suggested by you suggest that instead

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,300
editor they don't use flats flat slasher

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,980
flick structure the CSS is in the same

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,660
folder if their test is in the same

00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,070
folder we'll talk about test in a second

00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,480
and then we have a style guide which is

00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,060
essentially the website that you just

00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,270
saw it's a react web app you wish you

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,550
have all the components describing pages

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,560
if you want and plus components for the

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,810
style guide I'll show you a little bit

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,360
of code in a second things do notice if

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,740
you want we tend to use pure components

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,240
like other people so essentially there

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,300
is no statement there is nothing because

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,730
it's a UI component we split component a

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,440
lot in sub components not too much so be

00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,320
careful like because otherwise you end

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,570
up with powder they're not any more

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,970
atoms we used probe types as many other

00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,650
we just be meditation as I told you the

00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,680
class names are namespace it because

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,140
because we are using class names as a

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,400
way to declare the style you may have

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,229
conflict somewhere else if you call

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,789
something that button thoroughly you

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:43,580
will have a conflict so it's better a

00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,590
class name prefix for your class names

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,360
which is the class name

00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,670
for the new space for the company

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,320
library and we have a lot of we use a

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:55,310
lot of design tokens for the for the

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,610
essentially this design tokens that if

00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:02,870
so before in JSON are converted in

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:05,090
essentially XML for Android plist I

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,870
think or JSON either remember for iOS

00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,130
SAS or CSS or whatever you want so from

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,680
one single source of truth for the

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,110
designs tokens user a different file and

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,680
they're imported in the system now let's

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:21,860
look at the sample at Zambia come on at

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,540
example for a simple component very

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,730
simple you have two different states if

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,980
you are verified or fully verified and

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,110
the size of this component and the code

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,940
is very simple prop types use class

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,860
names we require can you see the space

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,930
between like you we tend to group like

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,460
okay these are the imports related to

00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,890
react if you want and these are the

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,630
import for this component we declared

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,190
prop types and default props before the

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,080
component so becomes documentation

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,300
they're all annotated with comments

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,860
which means then we can generate the

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,900
documentation that you saw when you were

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,460
switching tab you saw the documentation

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:57,560
is generated by this comment inside the

00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:59,990
code and then we as you see there I

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,030
don't have the pointer sorry we declare

00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:05,440
simply maybe I can zoom in a little bit

00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:08,240
here you can yes

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,180
it's very it's very simple use the icon

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,420
and so on and we nothing special I can

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,420
show you

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:20,270
CSS the instead is the CSS sass file

00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,920
can you see token color brother

00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,920
vilification which actually is analogous

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,920
to token color vanilla whatever it is

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,110
okay here then pixel is not a design

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,330
token is not used anywhere else makes

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,100
sense to use it here as 10 pixel so

00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,010
don't over use the design tokens there

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,050
are other design system that you have

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:44,390
thousands of design tokens but they are

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:46,580
intended to be like edited by the

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:49,100
developers in our case as someone else

00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,500
before us wanted say that we want to

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,140
have the components close so not someone

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,700
else editing the state or the look and

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,840
feel of the components come pretty close

00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,790
because they have been designed by

00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,100
designers let's look at something

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,020
more complex essentially school avatar a

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,500
bleak actually which can contain an

00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,540
avatar which is a photo or icon or a

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,850
placeholder for text and also can have a

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:14,750
badge or some text on the corner central

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:28,820
or on the left code I show you the code

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:29,900
in a second yep no yeah yes okay look

00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,060
here okay

00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,430
props nothing important but look here

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,770
can you see how I've broken down the

00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:40,490
avatar or more similar so we were

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:42,320
showing you the bed the brick yep this

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,540
one again props

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,580
a lot of props but actually these props

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,670
are nothing more than props which are

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:52,070
pass it down to subcomponents so if you

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:55,220
look here in the brick actually a very

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,110
small little bit very small

00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,000
subcomponents so I have a big component

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,650
which is a black box from outside but

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,260
actually I delegate the responsibility

00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,990
of small parts inside a smaller

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,360
components and these allow us to compose

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,760
easily things and especially the factor

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,380
things without impacting something above

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,480
because this is a black box you don't

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,280
know what's inside the brick I can

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,470
completely redesign completely the API

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:25,610
not the piano but the content of brick

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:27,410
and you will never know it okay some

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,350
numbers just to give you a rough idea

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,090
some thousands some ten thousandth line

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:36,050
of code of JavaScript and five thousand

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:38,870
line of CSS sass thirty-six component in

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,400
ninety-eight subcomponents 108 abuse

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,800
regression test you will see in a second

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,840
what it is and more or less we have like

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,120
a list of possible component we could

00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,220
build and we cover more or less 70% of

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,210
our UI visually action test is a

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,640
different way to test the UI of

00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:59,270
components in theory we can use just a

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,950
snapshot testing I prefer to use this

00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,270
one because essentially even if you're a

00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,240
fact imagine that you refactor the code

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:07,220
of a component the tests are failing is

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,960
good it's bad I don't know here you can

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,340
completely refractor one component but

00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,890
if the look and feel which is what I

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,710
care at the end is the same the test

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:20,660
here is essentially there is a tool that

00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:22,550
takes a screenshot to of one component

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,040
of one part of the page save it on the

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,450
on the on your machine and later when

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,680
you early on the test will compare the

00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,120
screenshot with the current screenshot

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,620
if there are difference this test fails

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,360
it's called visa regression testing at

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,660
this URL there's a nice presentation

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,970
about this regression test if you want

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,930
to read the full story of this design

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:46,580
system there are three not one blog post

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:48,830
on medium this address by the way I

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,710
share the slides on speaker back off

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,720
maybe tomorrow and tweet about them so

00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:56,000
all the links are clickable and you can

00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,500
follow their sources there now let's

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,950
talk about the bat which is the import

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,360
the interesting part I think okay this

00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:05,660
is one thing that more or less we

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,820
discussed said yet sorry before which is

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,250
the direction of componentization atomic

00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:13,130
design is cool what I use an auto RB the

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,660
molecule go up up up first of all not

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,790
many people understand what template is

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,590
which was his question which was one of

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:23,690
the problem yeah understand the organ is

00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:26,510
what is the template and this is the the

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:30,800
reason is because atomic design was

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:32,510
thought in terms of websites not web

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,610
applications so that's why we think in

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,400
terms of pages pages pages pages because

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,230
this was the idea you have a template

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,190
blog post the template index page the

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:45,920
template list of blog post the template

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,870
of contact that web application or not

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,660
is anymore they're complex they're

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,490
combined it each page if you want use

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,710
which state you don't reload the page so

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,510
maybe you click and something else

00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,490
appear in the same page is a different

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,940
page now so that's the reason why this

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:04,840
is complex to move from organized to

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:08,390
page the second thing is and this is our

00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,940
design system at General Electric coal

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,620
products was built designers don't work

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,390
in this way yes they can but up to a

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,190
certain level then you need annalistic

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,590
view to your design to your application

00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,000
and that's why they completely switch at

00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,280
the way in which i think in term of

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,080
design as they say they start to

00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,640
application then they go down feature

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,890
templates components basic

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,750
principles okay they completely change

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,280
the direction of componentization which

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,190
is something I strongly suggested to do

00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,710
understand this one but then when you

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,820
design or when you discuss about okay we

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,500
have to implement this feature discuss

00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,330
it in this way then go back and

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,430
understand how to compose and we will

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,860
get back to this why actually this is

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,870
very important okay the second bar but

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,790
is the atomic problem everything is a

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,890
component don't start to discuss about

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,990
oh this is not on Zee molecule and it's

00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,230
not me Jean Ann probably one of the most

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,820
famous contributor of the Design Systems

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,600
ecosystem not on Curtis the god of the

00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,830
design system train Walton are the Moors

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,300
many other so everything is a component

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,090
stop every discussion it's a flat

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,550
structure to remember in the folder here

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,980
in the folder structure and in the

00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,050
component structure but if you see there

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,660
a small icons on the side which means

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,720
Wow then you are categorizing they'll

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,790
just fake their icons attached to one

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,870
list in a navigation bar the data we

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,310
changed mind and say ah

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,620
this is not anymore a molecule this is

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:30,710
an organism okay change class to the

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:34,730
list item and you're done okay it's and

00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:36,050
also can you see this layout okay when

00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,730
we started to build components we

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,320
realize there are two different kind of

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,360
components something which is called

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,880
layout called something which is similar

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,560
to layout is not per se it's not a

00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,550
components a component that you use to

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,020
organize something else

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,880
it's something which is actually some

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,940
content with some styling some colors

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,640
and stuff and then when you combine them

00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,370
to remember the idea of composition to

00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,170
create a real component not sorry the

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,460
component that the designer was thinking

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,070
to the designer never thinks in this

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,930
term is really hard I I struggle still

00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,600
today to have the designer in these

00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,959
terms they start but they struggle and

00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,240
they don't understand that the spacing

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,980
they say ah I have my nice spacing

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,240
eight weeks at work because yes but

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,160
between what you have to express

00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,930
something like this in your sketch file

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,010
you have a template and then in your

00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:27,589
template you add your content now do you

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,660
remember this idea composition discussed

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,320
before this is composition in react

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,520
adulterous designer I compose two

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,260
components and obtain something that

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,510
this is what I want as a designer and as

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,580
a user I interact with

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,800
one I'd only talk with this one or this

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,810
one so that's the main idea of

00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,950
composition and written comes back from

00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:50,380
from the from the what components know

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,480
so how to look at your components they

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:56,950
already told you break down components

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,540
not too much you end up with dust what

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:02,050
does it mean break down a component it

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:04,480
means as CSS developer or is like

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:08,500
formula set developer we have this

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,150
approach I have a button and then we say

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,030
a but when I use this button is this

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:15,820
context instead of red is blue okay you

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:20,260
have two ways classically one is go to

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:21,610
the parent say dot sidebar okay and so

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,850
when you express the class you say dot

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:27,610
sidebar button size 22 pixel so you go

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,530
up okay and the other way classic is

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,960
like this button and there's an it

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,540
asking me something which is similar you

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,880
know what I create button - there's

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:40,180
something it's a variant of a button so

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,610
your natural way of working is going up

00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,370
so imagine that in this context or

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:47,080
sideways right Oh at this component now

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,820
this company does also this and then

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,360
this and there is this don't do it break

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,100
it down

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,350
understand if you have component a a

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,420
component B which is the common part and

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,730
then you break it down in something

00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:01,450
which is common which is C and a and B

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:03,790
are consuming C write C isolated even

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,620
black box if you want do remember I did

00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,360
know so you have small components which

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,640
are invisible to the developer but then

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,930
it's only one single so forth root and

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,610
only one place where you have to change

00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,170
something but this is the way you in

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,460
which you break down things but then

00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,170
dock don't go crazy because then

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,140
otherwise you you don't have any more

00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,850
deep components now this is the other

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,550
way around so you have to look at your

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,830
component understand okay how these

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,420
components build and then when you come

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:32,200
out with the idea of layout and content

00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:35,620
and when you have a component which mix

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,220
the two things I can show you maybe give

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:46,090
me a second can show you this one

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:47,559
means bringing a box here now look at

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,330
this component which is the one with the

00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,190
silk or the square and the other square

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:55,809
can you see that there is nothing about

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:58,030
color font nothing it's pure layout okay

00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:01,690
when you start to see this one mix it

00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,980
with color font it's a smell you should

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,039
break it down there is something that

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,929
probably you are mixing okay you can

00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:12,220
have components with like this double

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:14,020
behavior but it's pretty rare okay then

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,419
there is this thing called gal slow and

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,789
complex system it's here I'll show you

00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:22,000
it in a second a complex system it's

00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:25,000
like 40 years old this no 70 something

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,980
like 30 M or more it's not about design

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,929
system it's not even about software

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,770
it's about complex system in general

00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:35,830
like governments companies human systems

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:37,690
and so on a complex system that works is

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,120
invariably found to have a border from a

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,370
simple system that worked it this is for

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,830
example is a biology works the natural

00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,750
evolution okay a complex system designed

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,179
from scratch never works don't try to

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,640
build a big system such where a small

00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,590
system and evolve it always working and

00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,650
cannot be patched it up you can start

00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:58,690
try but will never work you have to

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,299
start over with a work simple system

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,640
working system or simple system the

00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:06,309
other body is okay with these components

00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,190
like everything is a component wait a

00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:11,110
moment are you sure so I heard that you

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,110
your company library needs to cover

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,400
every possible case of components well

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,530
this is something that you have to ask

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,240
yourself where to stop in the remember

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,549
in the atomic design you really need to

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,169
go up to there which this is the

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:24,610
question you have to do related to your

00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:26,620
business each one of us probably a

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,809
different answer for some business miss

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,150
make totally sensor right here for other

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:33,159
business may be hot on say molecular

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:35,559
more than enough then leave to the

00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,900
developer to compose things because each

00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:41,100
UI is completely different so we need to

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:44,590
do something not boost or even lower

00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,360
also because this happens if you don't

00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,490
build your components correct way the

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,290
cost of building more complex component

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,900
can increase dramatic

00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:55,780
if you don't wanna be a composition yeah

00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,550
I have a small object another small

00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,990
object and I combine them so if you

00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,930
everytime you're inventing a new

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:05,710
component mmm the cost crazy the other

00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:08,350
body isn't evangelization which means if

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:10,420
I speak with someone else my manager my

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,550
p.m. whatever and I show him the atomic

00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,760
design system cool I get it

00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:17,920
cool cool yeah clear and then this is

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,750
what remains stuck in their mind this

00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,430
this thing oh yes now we have components

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,040
everything will be fine no no no wait

00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:26,500
it's not so simple it's not just

00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,510
breakdown in atoms because there is the

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,100
human part is the process there is the

00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,500
fact that the designer will need to have

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,670
the flexibility also to change design so

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,560
you need to have a conversation between

00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,270
designer developers it's not just that

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,880
schema but this schema is what remains

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:42,340
in the band that of other people so you

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,190
have to work a lot to evangelize people

00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,290
in changing their mindset to just oh

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,630
this is what we work now from now on

00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,550
build some atoms throw them away throw

00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,590
them in in a UI anyway right no it

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,960
doesn't work like this so I have a

00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,600
couple of conclusions for you three

00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,730
actually one I was preparing this lies

00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,590
that like there's like we're almost

00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,470
ready but the conclusion I would say

00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,570
what are the conclusions in terms of

00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:11,350
what I want to say and this was easy

00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:13,110
which is clear no so a time in design

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:16,240
school but but it's just the beginning

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,590
you need to work from one single atom to

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,660
and start to look at an entire world an

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,400
entire ecosystem of your company how it

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,920
works how to use this methodology and

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,140
adapt it to your company to your team to

00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,320
your colleague to your designer it's not

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:33,130
oh let's just do atomic design mmm it's

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,870
a tool use it but for you so end here

00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,320
please

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:40,570
the second one was I was thinking I

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,790
realize wow I wrote look at the date

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,890
Oh copied every one place sorry I have

00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,830
to copy paste it's in a blog post I

00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,200
wrote like in 2015 and so on I remember

00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,720
this images say yes that's what I want

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,430
to say the complexity of the of the

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,830
atomic design is not in the drawing

00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,720
design itself it's in this connection if

00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,090
you have three atoms if you don't find

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,470
the correct way to connect them doesn't

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,090
work and so the organ is the

00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,190
complexities here in designing

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,440
the roots how you combine the atoms how

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,179
do you as they say oh we designed the

00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,130
atoms then we put them in a page and

00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:13,840
whoa it's horrible

00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,549
maybe you didn't design correctly this

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,350
connector you didn't think in term of

00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:19,360
this connection so this is where the

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,309
complexity is is where your work starts

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,350
but we design cool but don't forget

00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:26,200
about red points and the red points are

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:29,289
about adding annalistic view to your

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,770
system how to combine things and can I

00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:34,450
just say something this is maybe p.m.

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:37,179
designer developer how do you

00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:40,090
communicate between them how do you pass

00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:41,679
the information how do you create

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,860
meetings in which you discuss about the

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,080
component is not necessary code and this

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,429
is the final suggestion

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,320
nothing is particularly hard if you

00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:54,460
divide it in small jobs by a afford it's

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:57,130
in the London Museum of Design and it I

00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:59,559
think it's amazing is like always break

00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:02,440
in small jobs not only it's not about

00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:04,000
atomic design is not about breaking down

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,230
