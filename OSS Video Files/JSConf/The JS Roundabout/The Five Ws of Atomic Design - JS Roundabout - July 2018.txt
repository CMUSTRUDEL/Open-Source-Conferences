Publication date: 2018-07-24
Playlist: The JS Roundabout
Description: 
	Presented by Riccardo Erra from Hackney Council.

In this talk Riccardo will introduce the basic concepts of atomic design and help us understand and know more about who invented it, what atomic design is, where and when it should be implemented and why.

hello everyone so this toolkit is the

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:08,460
first one of of tonight and I guess so

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,800
the dogs would be about atomic design

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,690
and I will go first

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,870
and there's at least the five W's of

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,670
atomic design so let's start this so

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,310
hello everyone ciao I'm Italian

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,869
so hello ciao means I don't know if you

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,220
know where the word may be never been in

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,019
a restaurant I've been served by an

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,510
Italian waiter or waitress and so you

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,939
never heard the word that means a low so

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,520
as I said my name is Ricardo and also as

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,680
a result I'm Italian and you know

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,079
classically when start stereotypes pasta

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,300
pizza whatever I used to I did like a

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,370
similar talk like in my previous company

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,680
as a lacking internal talk and I also

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,410
used to have like the emoji of like a

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,410
claw football but I removed that because

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,969
you know you know in the last month

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,809
there was like some games on TV

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,910
friendlies I don't care than I repent so

00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:59,160
yeah so let's move on

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,899
so that's why I am so what I do so I'm a

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,449
lead from 10 developer at Hackney

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:09,270
Hackney Council everyone in this room

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:11,460
lives in Hockney borrow few cool so I

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,740
just joined actually two weeks ago and

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,990
it's being like very very good so far

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,630
it's a quite interesting job and it's

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,390
quite interesting like council what

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,299
we're doing it's very like unique we're

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,470
trying to collaborate a lot with other

00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:27,659
councils about so like with central

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,490
government and like companies that work

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,820
with central governments we try to build

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,650
like digital services that are kind of

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,970
like user driven so we're thinking about

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,180
the users first more than about

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,460
technology and other stuff and we are

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,380
trying to be like very modern in terms

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,200
of either today we use we have like a

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,649
manifesto we have like an entire life

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,030
cycle we are using like everything's on

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,399
we're moving everything on the cloud on

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,549
a Roku in AWS we use like tester and

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,930
development we do pair programming it's

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,500
very very cool and very very modern

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,240
other consoles like they don't try to

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,649
like do this kind of other stuff no

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,509
because they're able to but just because

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,950
you know it can be expensive that you

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,379
need to add people and stuff like that

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,090
and by its very cool I'm quite quite

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,380
excited of Johnny's company and this is

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,080
the console and

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,020
by the way we are hiring like soon more

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,940
front-end developers so if any of you is

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,920
looking for a job or you have a job but

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,200
you want something better and you know

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,520
after this talk and at the end or like

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,430
in the pod come and have a chat with me

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,020
and especially you know minorities and

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,090
representing groups from it something's

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,020
very important so you know feel free to

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,130
come and never chat with me so regarding

00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,840
like that's my role you know Lee from

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,790
the developer but like what do I do

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,860
like I call myself like you know

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,830
juggling like a CSS architect and it's

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,650
not real like you know bro but because

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,810
it's I love CSS so much and I care about

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,690
like writing semantics accessible HTML

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,180
and surprised I'm not actually just

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,760
developer so I mean a J's meetup but I

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,340
don't do Jas I can do Jas but I never

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,770
wrote like any react or angular or view

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,710
and you know you can still be a

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,510
front-end developer and not be like a.j

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,730
as developer and that's why I like you

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,980
know sometimes like I think I prefer to

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,170
call myself a front-end designer that's

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,760
something that actually this explained

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,250
well well what it is like it's you know

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,600
is the personal in a way builds like a

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,510
bridge between like design and

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,940
development and this kind of like role

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,400
this name was invented by a guy called

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:34,440
Brad frost who's also like the inventor

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,690
of atomic design so surprised and also

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,770
scary Maji this is my first ever public

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,750
talk so you know press yourself and you

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,850
know thank you and you know if at some

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,890
point like I panic and I run away it's

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,050
not your fault it's me so thank you in

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,390
advance and yeah there's a little

00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,850
presentation so let's start and let's

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,250
talk about atomic design as the diode

00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,770
said I was talking about atomic design

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,959
consider like the five W's of atomic

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,670
design the fact that be something like

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,250
usually get used like in Germany so my

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,650
investigation so how to like analyze a

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:11,130
topic and stuff like that so the first

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,320
it's the who so who invented atomic

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,190
design and as I said was invented by

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,650
this guy

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:20,100
Brett Frost who also as a lovely dog

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:22,169
this dog and so breath Frost is a

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,210
front-end developer is an American guy

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,009
and

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,479
very good developer is a very nice guy I

00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:28,850
never met him but I know someone who met

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:35,000
him told me a nice guy so I guess it's a

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:37,460
nice guy and so he came like few years

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,349
ago about out with these like concept of

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,479
atomic design and this like methodology

00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:43,660
about atomic design he even like

00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:46,160
developed a tool that can be used for

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,650
using the methodology of atomic design

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,569
called patent lab but we're not going to

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:56,720
talk about that tonight and yeah also he

00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:58,070
he wrote a book about about odami

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,979
designed that probably you should all

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,479
read it's digital and also it's physical

00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,860
copy if you want a physical copy comes

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,770
with a nice sticker if you want a

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:10,160
physical copy so this is the guide is

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:12,710
dog so the what so what is it is atomic

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,330
design so we can have like a very simple

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,110
illustration that can explain everything

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,789
and it's this one but obviously doesn't

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,009
make any sense for you probably right

00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:25,400
now because I have to explain what it is

00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:28,280
so I will go back to this once explained

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,380
a bit more about the what and I'm pretty

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,949
sure this will be more clear full of you

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:38,199
so let's start from the first one so the

00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:41,690
atoms so what is an atom so an atom it's

00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,820
small and independent component and what

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,380
I mean with that is that we you know

00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,479
where the design of a page or the

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:51,409
product of an app and we break down the

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:53,419
design into components and so what we

00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:55,849
end up doing is not like we design pages

00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:59,810
or with design screens we just design

00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:01,940
and build like components and if we do

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,979
that instead of like doing pages or

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,259
other kind of like big monolithic stuff

00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:10,039
but we do it's like we are able to avoid

00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,630
a repetition and confusion and you know

00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:14,330
what this brings us at the end it just

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,219
like we can easily build less stuff and

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,110
quicker because you know it's less

00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:21,380
confusing it's more clear it's like

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:24,139
smaller pieces and you know what you get

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,229
it is kind of like very nice gift some

00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,530
chief give and you know let's watch this

00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,120
again

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:33,409
like you know it's looping so we can

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,419
have a look why it is so this is like

00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:36,460
all atoms they combine all together in

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:38,290
magic

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,920
and then a component like then a

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:44,980
template and then a page so let's go

00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:48,220
back to this one again so we have atoms

00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:51,910
molecules organism templates and pages

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,380
so if we go back to this again sonar

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,840
tones for example here we can see like

00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,450
three atoms you know like the label like

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,660
you know that the data form and the

00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:04,600
bottom and then that form altogether you

00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,010
know it's a molecule this because it's

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,330
like an independent component lis by

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,010
itself and then it's part with other

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,200
molecules that can be in this case like

00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,140
the other and then of and there would be

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,800
like the full like I guess top bar we

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,960
can call it and then the top bar it's

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,510
the organism and then we combine

00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,580
organism together and with that we build

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,130
templates and then once we have

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,440
templates we can add like VL data to

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,540
those templates and we build pages and

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,640
if you think about that like it's a

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,890
quite simple concept in a way it just

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,150
requires I guess breaking down at the

00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,040
beginning like what you have and

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,800
thinking about like breaking down in

00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,000
this concept so this is what the what so

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,050
what we're doing and what is atomic

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,060
design so let's go next so the why why

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,890
we're doing this like we know what we

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,230
have to do and explain it quickly what

00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:56,050
is design about why we're doing like

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:58,750
what we're gaining with this so we're

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,210
doing this because we should design and

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,360
build components and not pages as I said

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,970
before and the reason why we should do

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,100
that it's because today and not just

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,990
today as in 2018 today I guess in the

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,660
last I don't know 10 years probably on

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,840
the web like we design and build a lot

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,730
of everything we design a build for a

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,040
lot of devices and with this under built

00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:24,690
for low scenarios you know devices your

00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,470
phone your tablet your computer your

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,240
fridge because

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,860
fridge they can browse the internet or

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,450
know why your cards if you're reaching a

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,610
fever with Tesla I don't know good for

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:37,090
you and you know different scenarios

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,849
different web sites because we you might

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,080
be a brand product you have different

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,610
website for your different like branding

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,810
the different products different apps

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,670
because can be you know different

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:48,880
devices different oils and stuff like

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,720
that so we have situation like that's

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,269
all these things

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,029
we consider where these like millions of

00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:56,319
devices and this picture is very old I'm

00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:57,850
pretty sure now it's like 10 times more

00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:01,420
than this I seen like the amount of

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:04,180
devices that every one of us like use so

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,399
then we design and build a lot of pages

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,930
because sometimes fish is different from

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,069
different devices in different use and

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:15,430
then we want to avoid like confusion

00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:18,069
mistakes messy situation like we want to

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,550
avoid something like these as in like

00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:24,040
these are buttons from same website and

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,810
you know this doesn't make any sense

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,029
like what all different there's no like

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,310
consistency there's no like same color

00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:32,889
like I don't know padding spacing font

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,870
like everything is different this is not

00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:36,310
branding probably they'll code it in a

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,870
different way so it's very confusing

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,240
we're like blowing the code we're

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:44,829
rewriting things again this is no idea

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,139
for sure so then the next the next step

00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:48,850
is like the where so where we should

00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:51,790
implement these atomic design

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,250
methodology and we should apply this

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,860
methodology in our design as you like

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,930
you know you have your Photoshop

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,970
Illustrator sketch figma I don't know

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,939
what the use for designing Dreamweaver I

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,230
don't know adopt XP whatever in the

00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:08,050
browser maybe it isn't in the browser

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,639
you f to apply these methodologies like

00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,459
you know just design a small component

00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,860
just like design items and then design

00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:17,470
molecules like don't design pages like

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,879
design like this move things and when

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,490
you have all these more components like

00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,170
build pages out of these designs these

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,430
more components that you have if you

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,439
know if someone comes to you and asking

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,540
oh can I see a full page of this design

00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:29,920
you just like combine all the all these

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,480
components that you take you design and

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,879
you can bend them together and the page

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,100
is there it's quick and it's better like

00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:39,129
to kind of like manage and maintain and

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,389
these goes also like for you know apply

00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,459
this methodology also in your

00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:45,309
development so when you like developing

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:47,740
something like don't build like by hand

00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:50,410
your index dot HTML page or your index

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,500
dot JSP CH like build all the different

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,879
components individually and each of them

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,189
they will have their own style and their

00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,019
own function ID and then combine them

00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,730
together

00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,899
like the pages that you need and you

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,509
know you can do that on the fly I don't

00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,369
know depends about your solution or you

00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:07,319
can build them like you know just needed

00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:08,910
but it would be so much easy think about

00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:10,589
like I don't know Lego like you have

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,629
small bricks and then you build full

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,129
thing together so you just have to in a

00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:17,309
way like build the small bricks first

00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:19,319
and it's so much easier and it's kind of

00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,699
like I don't know as I said like you

00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:22,559
avoid a lot of mistakes in the process

00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:24,959
and it's way more like tiring and

00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:28,799
tedious and stuff like that so the last

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,739
of the five W's maybe the last it's the

00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,749
the when so when we should think and

00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:35,730
kind of like apply this methodology of

00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:37,889
atomic design and I would say

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,739
immediately like as soon as possible all

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,389
the time like thinking atomic design

00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:44,249
like every time think that like you

00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:46,739
should break down things in small pieces

00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:48,989
and you should always think like oh this

00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:51,179
mold let's say small atom that would be

00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:53,100
like on a simple button like this thing

00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,600
should be like consistent in throat

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,549
you'll design like if I don't know this

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,019
error comes to you design was not

00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,239
designing thinking about this concept of

00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,299
dummy design comes to you and shows you

00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:05,309
like a page with two buttons that do the

00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:07,980
same thing but they look different then

00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,509
question that say like why this is

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,939
different like this should be the same

00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:13,709
atom why this is not the same and if

00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,569
it's different doesn't it to be

00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:18,420
different instead like a variation of

00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:20,490
the same button the same atom or not so

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,249
like try to simplify and unify your

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,499
pieces of your designs in a very like

00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:27,980
small bits in atoms and just go there

00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:32,339
and like from there just like build up

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:34,019
so what's next next is actually the last

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:37,769
thing this time for real before I was

00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,269
not being honest so it's the house so as

00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,829
I said before you know the five W's it's

00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:43,410
what's being using journalism and

00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:46,470
investigation sometimes if the five W's

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,720
and the H so the the H is how so we know

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,899
the who the what the why the when aware

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,319
about how we implement like this

00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:57,239
methodology of atomic design and we

00:12:55,319 --> 00:13:01,290
implemented like building style guides

00:12:57,239 --> 00:13:03,449
pattern library design systems whatever

00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,459
where you go like I'm pretty sure like

00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,720
the the other folks too like that we'll

00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,759
talk after me they will talk about this

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,080
like in more in more details and you

00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,090
know

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,920
can use whatever technology you want

00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,830
like building and react in view in

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,960
angular personally I like just to build

00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,810
in simple like HTML and CSS and

00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,330
JavaScript just because in my experience

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,520
I've been working in companies like

00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,200
agencies but also like product companies

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,750
where an agency there would be multiple

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,220
projects and in public companies there

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:35,420
will be multiple products they are not

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:38,390
using kind of like the same coding like

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:41,600
the same like programming languages not

00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:44,150
using the same frameworks so I find like

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,090
for me it was easier and kind of like

00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,920
more time-saving to build like kind of a

00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,960
just simple HTML CSS and JavaScript and

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,540
then with that didn't just apply that

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,060
code in ever kind in any kind of like

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,260
already built like framework or

00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,830
application and stuff like that

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,030
obviously that's my preference and so

00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:06,440
that's why I'm talking about just like

00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:08,000
this generic concept and personally if I

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,950
want to use a tool I use something

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,110
called fractal it's very similar to

00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:15,230
pattern lapatinib as I said before was

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,550
the tool invented by best Frost fractal

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,190
is being invented by a guy from

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:22,340
clear:left he left is a digital agency

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,410
basing here in Ukraine Brighton and at

00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:27,620
the moment fractal is not being actively

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,930
maintained is on version one by still

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,000
like very functional and very flexible

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:34,250
and I love it it's very simple to use

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,260
and you can use whatever you want and

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,660
again like for me is that before like

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,040
just doing like simple HTML Javascript

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,050
for me is like the console of like an

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,450
MVP I start with the simple stuff and

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,490
then if after that you want to build in

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,290
react yeah I just go on top on that like

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,610
implements and react it after that you

00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,590
want to do something even more cool

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,780
there's some people experimenting with

00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,250
building like lifestyle guides as in

00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,470
like when you design a nomadic that when

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,380
you say something's capturing figma goes

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,000
into your like like style guide and

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,430
that's what's amazing button that's like

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,870
the next step and it's up to you one

00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,550
thing that I like is one last thing that

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,290
I know this white building likes Tigers

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,150
and butter libraries and implementing

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,730
the atomic design methodology is like

00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,470
that sometimes you have as I said a you

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,590
know the smallest component is like an

00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,720
atom an atom could be

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,070
button could be a label suffered that

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,410
will be header and sometimes you have

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,360
like something that's below the level is

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:28,800
I don't know your phone's your color

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:31,830
palette your I don't know your your

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,990
spacing like the stuff like that so how

00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,900
we should we should have this kind of

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,790
like bits in our in our components and

00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,950
how do we call them because they're not

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,870
items as you like they don't like your

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:47,310
phone's it's not a component that lives

00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:49,680
in a page so and I call that particles

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,570
I'm not sure if I invented that probably

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,330
not but having it's cool because it's
