good evening everyone so the previous

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,270
talk was led by two experts and right

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,130
now we're having a talk led by a junior

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,889
so you can see how cool inclusive and

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,870
diverse this conference is my name is

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,320
Amanda Cavallaro I'm a community

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,779
organizer at women techmakers and the

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,619
Google developers group London but for

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,949
cloud and I also get paid at my work

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:29,310
they work is that the resolver Dakota UK

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,529
which is an online platform that you can

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,570
complain for free so you don't have to

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,040
be on the phone for three hours or not

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,540
knowing the emails when you want to

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,320
complain to people you can just use our

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,420
free platform and today I'm going to

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,579
talk about this project that I had one

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,039
week to make I actually had a bit of

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,510
more time than that but I was wasting a

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,329
lot of time trying to come up with the

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,120
best idea so the context was I was

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,879
invited to speak at this conference for

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,680
girls and women in stem and since like I

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,680
work with with tech I thought it made

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,149
sense to just like because just having a

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,769
stand and having people come and give

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,960
them swag didn't make much sense to me

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,150
so I just wanted to have people play

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,299
this game I built and it was very very

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,070
cool and so this was the picture of the

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,780
day or the event this was before and

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,780
then I put I did give people the swag

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:24,150
and there were girls and it was just

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,700
amazing so first thing I did was just

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,090
modeling everything so I just got my

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,579
tablet and I wrote like I actually drew

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,829
I do how I envisioned envision it so I

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,990
just thought okay I'm going to do a logo

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,240
and the game is going to be people just

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,310
write something in HTML and then it's

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,170
going to be rendered and you can see the

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,020
page rendered on the same page just to

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,180
text boxes and then you could add the

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,220
photo from from my webkinz since they

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,990
were going to use my my computer on the

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,899
day and then you could just add some

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,759
styles to that but again it was just one

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,619
week and I has been working with react

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,509
for just a couple months so I just

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,549
thought maybe I can do it then but

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,200
before I chose react I was just thinking

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,929
what should i what should I use should I

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,000
use angular should I use react what

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,630
should i do then

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,880
I thought I'm wasting too much time just

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,140
choosing the framework or library or

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,930
whatever I'm just going to start

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,400
sketching things so I just know it's

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,460
better than that drawing I made before

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,990
so I just put the text boxes the images

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,459
and the button then everything was just

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,390
written with an h1 it wasn't even

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:37,050
buttons or anything just wire framing

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:39,480
and then I just added some jQuery it was

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,940
magical but again so I'm just trying to

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,709
show you how like me as a junior how I

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,060
think so many of you are thinking she's

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,170
doing everything wrong but I just wanted

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,970
to share maybe there are some other

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,250
juniors here they think in a different

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,440
or maybe a similar way they get the same

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,940
fright as I did and it's very hard to

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,160
talk about things that are not good at

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:01,170
in front of I don't know 160 people but

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,000
okay I'm doing this then at this point I

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,680
really just want because it was really

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,390
bad to look at that I just wanted to

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,830
stop and add CSS and make everything

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,930
pretty but I'm like let's stick to the

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,020
plan let's just you have these to do

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,060
let's add continue as a jQuery try to

00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,060
make just one animation so I added

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,920
jQuery and may just put one animation

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,500
and think those things were working fine

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,239
then I thought it's time to choose what

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,980
I'm going to use so I went for react

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,080
because as I told you I was studying for

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,549
a couple months and I was just like you

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,570
know when you're following tutorials and

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,400
then things just seem to make sense

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,110
they're like I'm so good at it

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,510
but then when you actually have to do

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,030
things on your own it gets a bit harder

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,950
so I chose to use create react up

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,760
because it was simpler it was easier and

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:50,190
I just had one week and then I hosted

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,220
the page on that Lefroy which is awesome

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,100
very easy to do as well and then okay

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,170
things were actually you know so that's

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,320
how everything was looking when I just

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:04,170
added react and then I spent some time

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,630
just playing with things and it's very

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,459
hard for me to get just the HTML and

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,160
pass it to JSX so I went to those

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,320
websites HTML to JSX and they just put

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,299
things in there and then it helped me a

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,160
lot because then after I pasted this

00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,829
first time I could just repeat and

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,049
reproduce the the first steps and then I

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,490
had my two tags that were really badly

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,350
aligned and things were looking bad but

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:29,430
they were working in react it was

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:32,280
really exciting then so before since I

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,070
did everything with tags I had one

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:39,390
so one tag for jQuery so what I had to

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,860
do was just use NPM that the expert said

00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,640
it was very good so I'm doing it right

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,250
so I just had a jQuery in the right way

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,670
and then it was time to use the webcam

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,290
thing me then I went on that webpage I

00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,240
think and p.m. where you can see all the

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,160
packages and everything and then I just

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,040
saw this awesome thing that had

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,560
everything that I wanted and then I

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,500
could just capture a photo and then you

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,240
could you use jQuery to just add the so

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,580
I could just use those few ters or I

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,410
could just change using animations which

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,020
is awesome for the beginners there to

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,180
play with it but again it was just one

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,970
week and I was dreaming hi and I was not

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:24,180
and I was doing this alone so okay so

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:26,580
things were working it was not very

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,380
inviting but okay but then I actually

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,370
used some boots fried and just use the

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,380
colors and I was feeling so good sorry

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,240
but then I had a problem I thought I was

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,370
the expert of bootstrap and I I just

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,290
started to add things with like row and

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,300
then add the twelve column grid and then

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,680
add the row and then I noticed I was

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,110
doing things wrong because you don't

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,480
have to repeat the row all the time but

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,340
the time that took me to realize that I

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,170
was doing wrong cause know most telling

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,980
me so it took me a long time and the

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:58,020
things were just overlapping them then I

00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,940
figured how to do it yeah so now they're

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,720
not overlapping anymore but then they're

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:07,500
not really well aligned okay so I

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,300
managed I aligned it but now the image

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,180
so remember the person was supposed to

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,130
type here choose it and the thing was

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,050
going to output there but it's outside

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,680
of the text but was it so hard to the

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,630
textbox things then I had three days to

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,440
finish I was panicking like it was

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,290
almost there

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,930
so I decided to just change the project

00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:30,330
project it was really disappointing but

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,550
it just needed something that worked so

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,640
instead of using the collab cam thing I

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,740
decided to just use images and then I

00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,550
just got like some static images of a

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:47,039
cat

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:48,690
and of a dog and where's the hamster I

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,370
also I did I'm sorry I also got very

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,229
offended from the previous talk that he

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:56,610
didn't mention who is a hamster person I

00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:58,800
am anyone Thank You Jesus Christ okay so

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,870
from the previous slide I had the

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,940
filters then I worked on the future and

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,680
edit some sappy I was looking cool who

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,849
who needed those webcam filters come on

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,069
this was just excellent then it was the

00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:13,919
day before and things were not working

00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:17,130
and I don't know if you ever worked with

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,770
default value and value here but so

00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:22,080
basically let me just get back to the

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,810
thing here so whatever I was typing here

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,750
was outputting there but then when I was

00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,419
I was using default value whatever I

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,969
typed it was showing there but the image

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:35,280
when I chose it wouldn't change and if I

00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:37,500
use used value the images would change

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,909
but the text wouldn't so at this point I

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,550
was like what am I going to do it's

00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:43,110
tomorrow so I was just very proud and I

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,940
didn't want to ask for help because it

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,280
was my first project but I just had to

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,169
so I asked my friend Tomas who was just

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,599
an expert and everything and then he

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:54,719
actually changed things so what he told

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,360
me to do was instead that was a code of

00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:59,969
that he gave me so instead of using the

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,169
just value or default value I have to

00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:06,180
use value with in managing the state and

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:08,099
then things worked and it was okay to

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,069
ask for help after all even if you have

00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:12,719
your baby project it's okay to ask for

00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:14,190
help with people you trust and just

00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:19,440
right channels going and Stack Overflow

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:21,449
and stuff so that on the day things were

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,699
looking good with the hamster not many

00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:26,340
people chose the hamster though and one

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,219
thing and another thing that I did wrong

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,529
is like I waited until everything was

00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:33,779
finished I had like enormous code and I

00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:35,880
didn't divide things in the in the

00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,310
components which was very hard to

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,959
separate things after it so if only I

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,089
had started in the beginning with my

00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:44,700
four components I think I'd be a lot

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:47,250
less lost so that's also a piece of

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,770
advice for people and I'm going to show

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:58,450
you the sorry the

00:08:50,770 --> 00:09:04,510
Oh or is it not this one so basically

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:05,920
whatever I wrote here and then my

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,200
favorite color

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,420
I changed my favorite color so my cute

00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,790
pet and then I choose the hamster and

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,800
then I you I would ask the girls like

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:18,760
just choose your favorite style click on

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,200
the on the filter you like and then you

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,810
have to come here and you wear it so

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,670
it's a it's a style for the image where

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,860
where is the image tag just go there and

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,540
change it there and then people like oh

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,540
my god I'm such a hacker I can just can

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:34,029
do stuff and things like bad and then

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,980
yeah it was very nice even even if it

00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:37,750
was just a simple thing people were like

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,029
they had no idea what coding law so some

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,100
of them just did some like simple HTML

00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:43,839
classes in school so they were feeling

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,430
like oh my god I really got this don't

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,230
worry so what I would have done

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,330
differently I would have spent more time

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,709
modeling the project because maybe then

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,600
I would have realized I wouldn't have

00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:56,589
time to do the webcam webcam thingy

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,990
before I'd also have so I started to get

00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:00,820
repost the repository only when I I

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,620
realized I was going to use react but

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,690
why didn't I start before so start from

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,029
the beginning to use any version control

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,220
you want and I would have as I said

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,560
separated things in the react component

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,270
letter right now and you know when you

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,130
run the audit thing in the white house

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,750
thing that's how the the thing is

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,730
working right now so I would have spent

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,790
more time in those things that people

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:24,370
who are smarter than me say is important

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:26,050
and some on some of the comments I heard

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,520
in the day as I told you so it was very

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,010
nice to just see the girls doing

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:34,990
something and some of the nice things I

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:36,940
I saw there and just some tips I give to

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,770
everyone as a person who is learning and

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,899
talking to people about this too very

00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,399
hard so just try to build projects from

00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:44,410
scratch because many times that work

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,930
like people have already started like

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,550
that project exists for years and then

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,050
you're just like fixing things and then

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,839
sometimes you go on Stack Overflow you

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,640
find the dancer quickly you don't you

00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,230
don't get the time anytime so just start

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,690
things on your own so if you have any

00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,890
time in your free time try to build

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,630
things from scratch because you're going

00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,920
to realize so many things you don't know

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,290
that you think you know and it's

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,810
okay to fail it's it's okay when things

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,610
are you put deadlines and you can't meet

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,290
them I mean for your projects not the

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,540
ones that work because if you're

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,920
learning from them so if from each thing

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,750
you're learning just one thing sometimes

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,279
we're just like but I need I need to do

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,230
many many things no it's okay if you

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,959
just learn one little little little

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,240
thing by day it's it's alright and ask

00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:29,899
for help it's okay don't bungle it too

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,079
proud like I walk ask for help and the

00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:35,240
last one is really important and if I

00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,190
wrote everything as I was doing I was

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,870
just I being and complaining and saying

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,339
things were difficult and yeah it worked

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,500
so if you want to read everything out

00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:44,449
share the slides and if you have any

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,370
questions that's where you can find me

00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:52,100
