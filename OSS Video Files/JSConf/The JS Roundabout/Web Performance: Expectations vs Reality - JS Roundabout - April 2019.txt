Title: Web Performance: Expectations vs Reality - JS Roundabout - April 2019
Publication date: 2019-04-05
Playlist: The JS Roundabout
Description: 
	Presented by Jorge Ferreiro.

“Why is my website slow?”, “How can I improve the loading time?”, “How does the browser render a website?”, “What techniques can I apply to boost the speed of my website?”.

You will not only learn about the most common performance mistakes in a webpage but also, what the best solutions are and the main trade-offs when it comes to web performance.

We will see in details the three parts that affect your web performance (network requests, browser parsing, and browser rendering), and we will cover everything from loading non-blocking Javascript, reducing bundle sizes, cache content and more techniques.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,240
so do you guys know that basically most

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,309
of your users 53% of your users will

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,000
leave your website if it takes more than

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,519
three seconds to download last year I

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,119
didn't know this number but I literally

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:23,460
face it in front of my face so basically

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:25,410
I release my new blog post and basically

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,140
I was getting to some like readers like

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,359
in one day it was around 1000 people and

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,050
then some other blog post go like 2,000

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,610
or 3,000 people thanks to Reddit so

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,920
basically most of the complaints of the

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,730
people we're kind of like hey your

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,879
website is really slow and for me um I

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,390
didn't know what to do so those those

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,129
are numbers from last year basically on

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:58,770
how much fast where my website loading

00:00:52,129 --> 00:01:01,070
so I was kind of like what can I do so

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,329
basically I started to research and

00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,220
understanding all right so what is the

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,229
best way to do X or Y or how can i

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,420
optimize things and this is what I'm

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,729
gonna share with you today I'm gonna

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,110
share my findings and all the process

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,990
that I learn to improve my website so

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:23,790
I'm Jorge Farid oh oh by the way where's

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,710
mine all right so I'm Corcovado right

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,780
now I'm sober engineer Ari BAM right so

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,470
most of you will know because you booked

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,090
the tickets there so I'm basically right

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,250
now specializing more in front end

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,810
before that I was doing an internship at

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,400
Amazon as a backing engineer and

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:43,829
basically my role has been full-stack

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,250
I'm hosting a new YouTube show that is

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:50,100
gonna come up like next month and

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,720
basically am write blog post and I'm a

00:01:50,100 --> 00:02:00,060
really Hamilton fan

00:01:51,720 --> 00:02:01,920
the musical doesn't work yeah

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,159
so I'm from Madrid I was born and raised

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,590
there and I'm here with you for you guys

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,119
sorry I don't live in London I live in

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,860
Madrid so I came just for the

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,650
presentation so I'm really excited about

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,930
it so I remember I basically all

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,939
stack is react so for me was really cool

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,250
because before journey been bright I

00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:23,250
didn't know anything about react so it

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,519
was a really real interesting process to

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,829
to learn your staff on the go as I

00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,379
mentioned before I'm hosting this new TV

00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:33,239
show which is well TV show YouTube show

00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:36,720
which is developers in the F and the

00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:40,200
3:16 the idea is basically interviewing

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,750
top leaders in the industry CTOs VP's

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,909
director of engineering principal staff

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,560
engineer and brought their stories

00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:48,540
they're finding the list on learning all

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,519
those years in the career to the people

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,010
especially people that are starting

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,139
their careers as a computer engineers or

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,849
they're more like juniors but at the

00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,159
another day honestly I think like those

00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:02,209
kind of way of thinking and ideas is

00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:05,970
really interesting for for many people

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:08,189
so what are you going to learn today so

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,889
first of all my expectations when I

00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:13,139
started to research about web

00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,819
performance then some tools that you can

00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,819
use to start you know like measuring

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,940
your website and then how does the

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:23,160
browser work say my lessons learned and

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,250
a gift so I'm going to give you guys one

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:47,220
gif at the end so what is that gift

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:48,510
so is this t-shirt yeah so it's it's so

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,849
it's really cool and really proud of a

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,650
t-shirt it cost money so it's not like

00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:55,440
it's something that I I'm putting effort

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,750
on that so how are you gonna get that so

00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,940
basically there is this hashtag that is

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,150
gonna appear in all these lights at the

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,879
bottom so just feel free to tell how

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,260
don't you like my talk how how did you

00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,540
dislike the talk how do you like the

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,030
talk but can improve what not any quotes

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,889
any pictures and then at the end I'm

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:19,229
gonna basically like do a contest a quiz

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:21,120
I'm gonna survey that so the more you

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:24,150
tweet the more options you will get to

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,850
earn so let's get it started so my

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,590
expectations versus their reality

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,240
basically I was at home and I was

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,130
thinking yeah so I'm gonna go to Google

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,050
I'm gonna just search seven tips to

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,320
improve my website and boom everything

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:41,160
is gonna be great

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,590
that's a myth so what I discover is that

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,990
there's no a single way of doing things

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:49,410
and most of the time there's no like do

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,690
X and you are gonna get why for your use

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,850
case so I started to research different

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,800
companies basically going to their

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,080
website understand how do they handle

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:04,170
these web performance things and I learn

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:06,840
interesting things so Twitter there is a

00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:12,030
video so this is the first thing you see

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:14,550
at Twitter so it's loading this part and

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,810
then it loads the who to follow and the

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,550
transfer you so basically why do ya and

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,020
then this is the notifications part so

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,930
if you go to the notifications is the

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,960
same story the first thing that user

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,240
sees is your notifications area the

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,310
other part is like complimentary so what

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,530
I learned from that is basically it's

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,110
not about making all your website fast

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,120
it's all about making the part of your

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,860
website that creates value for the

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,620
business so in the case of the Twitter

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,990
when I want from the user sees Boone see

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,450
my timeline Boone follow people retweets

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,790
I don't want them to waste time for

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:54,360
transfer you it's not that important

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,920
than who to follow then I went so that's

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,930
what I call the critical path and many

00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,460
people call it which is what is the most

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,700
important part of your application that

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,280
usually display first to the user then I

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,650
went to YouTube and I searched for my

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,450
favorite YouTube show Peppa Pig how many

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:14,250
of you do you know Peppa Pig yeah so

00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:22,230
this is what happens this is the first

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:24,960
loading of the website again the first

00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,360
thing that we see is the video people go

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,930
to youtube for watching video and then

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,240
oh this is crazy and then basically you

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,430
know they show this ad they show the

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,460
what's next but that's what create value

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,900
and that's why people go to YouTube so

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,680
that was kind of that was real

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,009
interesting for

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,130
for me so at the another day my takeaway

00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:48,870
was kind of like hey it's all about

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,050
measuring web performance about

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:54,570
measuring comparing and also

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,460
understanding your business needs it's

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,440
not about like just making something

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,919
fast just because of that at a good

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,680
example of this is Twitter Facebook so

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,120
imagine that you say well people will go

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,100
to the frequently asked questions in my

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,370
website and it takes five seconds okay

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,349
it sucks but doesn't matter you will not

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,110
bring money just because of that you

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:18,990
will bring money showing the home doing

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,030
any other stuff so for me that I'm a big

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:25,080
fan of electronic music so it's all

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:27,419
about think first measure compare repeat

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:32,099
think measure compare repeat think

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:36,479
measure compare repealed Fat Boy slim

00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:40,380
I think he's from Britain I don't know

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:43,050
but anyway so now let's move forward and

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,599
let's see all right so now we understand

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,570
what performin is important I should get

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,250
about web performance are doing that so

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,770
what are the tools that we can use to

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:58,440
understand what's going on on our house

00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:02,010
all right so this is kind of the popular

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:05,490
ones so page insights it's as easy as

00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:07,590
you go you type your website and boom it

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,169
runs like a test on mobile and desktop

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:13,080
and you see the results and also is

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:16,020
really interesting because it shows like

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,940
different suggestions like all right you

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,759
are doing really bad on optimizing your

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,639
pictures what you can do and they link

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,830
to to their online documentation so it's

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,930
a really good learning opportunity I

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,020
learned a lot from that then the second

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,669
one is similar but in your browser so if

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,709
you use for example Chrome Canary and I

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,990
get like in the normal Chrome if you go

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:40,860
to the feature flex you may find that is

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:44,720
the audits so is same idea you just run

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:49,529
it and locally it runs like different

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,020
different tests and there is a the last

00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,950
one but I mean it's crazy there are many

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:58,260
many of them but this one is from

00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,090
so it's it's a node module so you just

00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,830
require its performance and basically

00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,840
have like different methods in their API

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,760
so in this case for example you just

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,370
simple as saying I want to create a mark

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,230
so this is the starting of my

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,120
performance measurement then here you

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,520
ran like different operations and here

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,980
you say end and now you call the measure

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,860
and it will shows alright so how long

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:23,610
did it take it cetera and here there are

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,990
some like commands if you download the

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,810
presentation and you want to play around

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,300
with that this is also available in in

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:34,560
Chrome in the browser so you don't only

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,960
need note to run it alright so how many

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,050
of you knows exactly what happens when

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,180
you heat google.com until you see

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,840
everything in your screen how many of

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,520
you know that honestly you just like

00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,930
because you don't want to raise your

00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,410
hands or it's because you don't know

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:55,260
okay now I didn't know as well so that's

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,330
that's cool so for me to be honest it

00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,490
was kind of like a black box it was kind

00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,650
of like magic like I didn't care

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,200
honestly it's like alright I go to

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,750
twitter.com and I see beautiful things

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,300
in my in my screen but I didn't know

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,370
what was behind the scenes right so then

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,340
I started to research so the first thing

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,550
was all right let's get the HTML from

00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:20,160
the server

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:23,220
the second part is let's I'm by the way

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,930
this is what the browser does so the

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,960
second part was basically an HTML

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:30,390
transformation so at the end of the day

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,190
the goal of the browser is you pass me

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,930
this kind of bytes that I don't

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,510
understand that I don't know you tell me

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,280
that the encoding is HTML so I want to

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,680
create a high-level representation of

00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,890
that code so this is what it what is

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,770
doing here so you have this tree which

00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,660
is like the Dom document object model so

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,510
you see like the different parts the

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,830
different parts of the HTML commit it

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:58,470
into a tree the second part is all about

00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,600
the CSS one by the way this is exactly

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,330
like the flow so you start with bytes

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,840
which is like what computer shares

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:08,550
characters talking notes done all right

00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,190
now

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,440
you go to CSS transformation so the

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:17,130
browser does the same thing but for the

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,780
CSS so again the goal of the browser is

00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,750
saying I want to create this high level

00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:27,060
representation this tree out of these

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:29,340
CSS that you provide me and finally the

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,620
goal of the browser is to create this

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,390
render tree this is what the browser is

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,720
going to use in order to print and put

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,970
beautiful things in your screen so that

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,770
ran the tree at the end of the days the

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:47,460
combination of the DOM and the CSS done

00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:48,750
so a good example of that so maybe like

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,170
the people that are like just on the

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,330
back will not see these but for example

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,160
this is finding is displaying known so

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,870
at the another way the browser don't

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,560
doesn't want to display that to the user

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:03,890
so you you will see here that that this

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:09,110
span doesn't appear in the render tree

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:15,150
and the last part is all about painting

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:17,510
that's it so for me they're like three

00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,860
concept when it comes to web performance

00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:23,100
the the first one is net will request

00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:26,100
how long does it take to get that HTML

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,500
from the server the second one is

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,230
parsing so I don't know anything about

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,970
this HTML that you're giving me but I

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,740
will create that beautiful tree and I

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,750
will understand what's going on behind

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,670
the scenes and if for example if it's

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,950
JavaScript there will be some

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,170
optimizations along the way and then the

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,670
third part is all about painting is all

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:49,560
about rendering and displaying to the

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:52,440
user so one thing that I learned that

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:56,790
surprised me a lot is that basically the

00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:00,750
part is most consuming time consuming is

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:02,780
the parsing time so it's basically that

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,510
creation of the tree that's why

00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,550
basically the size of your HTML or the

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,610
size of your JavaScript has a direct

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:15,180
impact on the parsing time and on the

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:17,550
performance is its itself so kind of my

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,550
takeaway from that we're something like

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,320
shipping less code reduces the time for

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,570
parsing compiling

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,650
basically executing the code I'm not

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,480
saying right--let's

00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:29,460
less code so you your colleagues will

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,190
hate you because nobody understand what

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,750
you're doing what I'm saying is like if

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,320
you have two alternatives and you can

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:39,240
reduce the number the number of lines of

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,640
the code it's perfectly fine so just

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,230
like think about it for me this was an

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,850
eye-opening because when I was writing

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:50,360
CSS I I mean I care but I I wasn't aware

00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,170
of the impact of alright I'm writing CSS

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,630
boo-boo-boo-boo-boo n-- but at the end

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,810
of the day it has a direct impact on the

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,810
performance

00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,210
so now let's let's change to six lessons

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,730
that I learned that I would like to

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,740
share with you there are more so this is

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,520
just like six because we don't have much

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,690
time so let's get it started

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,480
all right so let's start with a

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:18,240
disclaimer as I said before and it's

00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,730
like kind of like pointed out the same

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,480
thing one over and over is there's no

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:29,340
silver bullet solution for web

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:32,940
performance and another thing was for me

00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:35,370
don't do a premature optimization find

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,930
your real business needs because we are

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,610
programmers we are suffering ten years

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,320
where people like are starting their

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,570
careers people up with more gears in

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,760
their careers and we always tend to say

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,740
ya wanna create the most performance

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,840
thing or I want to make like everything

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,030
super amazing something I'm learning

00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,980
right now working at IBM Bret and kind

00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,420
of my business units this incubation is

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,160
research and development but we are

00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,550
building a startup from scratch is

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:03,480
basically how to find a balance between

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:06,930
shipping software but not like via super

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,490
perfectionist out of it so it's hard but

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,310
I'm learning that and I think like

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,020
finding a valent and strive for high

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,820
quality of your soap well by delivering

00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:19,200
fast it's important okay so for me

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,850
something that is really awesome and I

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,370
couldn't expect for that technical talk

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,340
is basically saying empathy with your

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,860
users for me it's all about empathy

00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:31,890
honestly before starting to research all

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,170
these stuff I was kind of like well I

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,740
don't know even that people is using

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,170
Internet

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,950
but something that I realized is that

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,840
not like we're engineers or business

00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:47,440
people business that are in tech in a

00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:51,070
way but there are many people out there

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,810
that don't have the latest iPhone there

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:56,590
are people out there that has a really

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:59,140
crappy Windows computer that is really

00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:01,330
low on even worse there are people out

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,610
there that doesn't have a high-speed

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,500
internet connection and that's a reality

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,530
especially in the developing countries

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,320
and that's something that to be honest I

00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:15,550
didn't think before but now for me it

00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,200
makes total sense so this is more kind

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,780
of the reality that you will find out

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,080
there so for example is low access to

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:27,700
Internet expensive internet fairs that's

00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:32,290
why the size of your bundle matters also

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:34,390
cheap phones computer etc so my takeaway

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,940
or kind of like my mental thought out of

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,520
out of it is basically code for

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,140
everybody and half a team culture we're

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,510
basically testing in multiple devices

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:46,390
and taking care of making sure that your

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:50,130
code shapes in multiple places is really

00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:55,290
important for example when when I joined

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:58,720
Eventbrite I didn't necessarily have a

00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:00,970
lot of background testing on Internet

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,620
Explorer or I didn't have a lot of

00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,140
background testing in multiple browsers

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,150
I was like oh yeah I have chrome I'm

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:10,030
gonna just run my code and if everything

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:13,180
looks fine that's fine but then I have a

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:15,250
KD which is our product manager and also

00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,520
she cares about QA and all that stuff

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,320
and say hey Jorge these that this is not

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,690
working this is not working an intern

00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,740
exporter or hey Jorge this is not

00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:29,800
working in Firefox yeah so surfer Muse

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,540
kind of like all right and honestly it

00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,490
can be very frustrating but once you

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,040
take that into can you started to even

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,540
learn more about the CSS and the basics

00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,790
because you will encounter province

00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,560
about the way you write your code the

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,200
way you write your Styles the way you

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,450
write they the layouts so it's a really

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,250
good learning opportunity and that's

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,330
something that I always try to do in my

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:54,129
day-to-day life

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:56,230
so the second one don't overwork and I

00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:58,779
know this is not something like don't

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,519
ever work in your real lives I mean when

00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:03,070
we are coding and we are when we are

00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,869
doing websites solo when you really need

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,820
so this is a good example of my website

00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:09,100
so this first screen has a lot of

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,139
pictures even though I optimized and

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,539
after knowing that yeah it has an impact

00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:16,169
so it has like in the first screen you

00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:18,639
have at least three six nine pictures

00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:20,830
bigger ones and then you have three more

00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,210
which is kind of like the Avatar so

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,779
that's a lot of pictures at the

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,389
beginning and the problem before is that

00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:31,389
when you're on in a mobile phone and for

00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:34,029
example you write an image tag it will

00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:36,100
literally go and scan all your HTML and

00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:39,309
download every single picture that do

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,200
you have there so I started to research

00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:42,759
and say alright so how can I fix that

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,450
because honestly if you are in a mobile

00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:49,450
phone this will shrink and you you will

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,700
only see until this so basically you are

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:54,759
loading these pictures these pictures

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,830
these pictures the ones below for

00:18:54,759 --> 00:19:00,909
nothing because the user is not even

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:03,039
there so so I research on that and yeah

00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:05,379
I mean lazy loading that turned that

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,320
everybody says so this is this was the

00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:12,369
improvement I got a 99 on desktop and I

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:15,669
got a 1991 on mobile phone and here you

00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:18,460
can see here basically the screen is in

00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:21,009
which point of the of the website you

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,989
are and whatever resource is behind the

00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:28,659
scenes that are downloading that are

00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:30,789
being downloaded but as I said before

00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:33,759
with the examples with Twitter it's not

00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:36,340
only about images it can be more things

00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,129
so for example in the case of Twitter as

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,659
I mentioned before they don't download

00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:43,659
first this part they don't download

00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:47,340
first that part they are from in one

00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:50,739
site they are saving never requests and

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,929
in the other side they are basically

00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:55,299
liberating resources so the browser is

00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:58,049
not busy painting other parts that are

00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:58,049
not needed at that time

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,110
third something that I recently

00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:05,210
discovered

00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:09,140
it's all about the modern images for

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:12,740
months so traditionally we have PNG we

00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:17,210
had jpg sometimes it's hard for me to

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:22,070
pronounce like words in English so I

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:24,049
discovered that basically it's really

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,460
impressive but most of the times that

00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,580
I've discovered that the website was

00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:31,520
taking longer it's because I got like 1

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,340
megabyte 2 megabyte pictures especially

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,919
with PNG pictures and for me that blows

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,750
my mind because I was I wasn't care like

00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,880
yeah I export this picture everything

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,500
looks great I access to this website I'm

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,210
with my high internet speed connection

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,549
everything looks fine but then I

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,470
discovered that by reducing that the

00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:51,020
first time that the users see like the

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,000
first render time like the first

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,950
rendering part that the user will be

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,900
able to interact with the website was

00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:04,160
faster by reducing the image size so

00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:05,570
yeah some formats like GPE j2000 web p

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,870
GP EGA

00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:11,830
ex-air but there is a problem guys

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,970
everything is not that cool so as always

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:17,000
there is the problem with the cross

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:21,290
browser compatibility so in this case

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,210
for example I found a way the link it

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,429
doesn't show up but basically once you

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,380
download the slides you will see and you

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:29,929
will access and it's more in detail but

00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,690
basically they they they put a bunch of

00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:34,970
fold air fall backs so first it's

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:37,520
alright I wanna load this web P picture

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,110
then gpj and then this other one so it's

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,370
kind of like the way they specify they

00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:44,260
alright so if the browser doesn't

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,260
support this or that we will fall back

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:55,220
all right who loves infinite infinite

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:59,809
list probably me okay thank you guys

00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:02,240
so until last year I wasn't aware of the

00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:06,830
issues with infinite lists I thought

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,780
well I mean if I'm scrolling and if I

00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,390
get more resources from the back end I

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,460
will put it and I will just display then

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,710
and everything will be fine that's

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,999
that's what an infinite scroller does so

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,129
there is a point where you go

00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:21,169
and say all right so this is kind of my

00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:23,299
tres hole I fetch more resources from

00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:25,939
the back end I put it there and then

00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:28,369
like once the user is more to that area

00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:32,419
will see the resources we will see the

00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:36,259
the content but I started to work on

00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:39,409
like my first react project which was

00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,219
the messages the messages application it

00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:42,619
was very simple

00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:45,559
nothing like super cool so you can just

00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:49,309
swipe right to this current message you

00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:52,029
can put favorite if you go here you will

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:54,469
see all the list of favorites messages

00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:57,499
something that I really love is the dark

00:22:54,469 --> 00:22:59,659
mode a dark mode so now everything

00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:03,079
change and everything looks blue and I

00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:05,059
love dark mode and then you can search

00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,329
and all that stuff so cool so far so

00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,549
good

00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:10,939
the thing with this project is that I

00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:14,419
made myself a requirement like I put the

00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:17,989
business guide hat and I said I want

00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:22,189
this to be able to scroll all the way

00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:23,989
down all the way down and nothing will

00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:26,299
be broken because before of that

00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:28,549
basically when I implemented that first

00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:33,139
solution like the naive infinite

00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:35,149
scroller oh my god like everything ever

00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:38,179
everything explodes because basically

00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:39,979
when you have like a lot of notes like

00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:42,589
one that will not burn thousand ten

00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:44,809
thousand nodes or filled a fifty

00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:47,209
thousand notes everything is is

00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:48,799
requiring resources from the CPU are

00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:51,529
requiring resources from the computer

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,599
and everything is a started to be really

00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:56,719
really slow and there was some tile were

00:23:53,599 --> 00:24:00,229
basically Mike my my browser breaks and

00:23:56,719 --> 00:24:04,119
I was like so so basically I come up

00:24:00,229 --> 00:24:07,479
with this solution which is I I abstract

00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:10,819
the idea of this infinite card list and

00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:12,979
at the another day what I rely was in in

00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:15,709
in react beautiful eyes which is a

00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:17,329
really nice library really popular

00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:20,839
supports it with many companies like

00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:25,039
Airbnb another folks for doing like all

00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:27,139
this optimization when you are scrolling

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,699
and kind of idea is basically making

00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:30,269
sure that even you are scrolling all the

00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:31,950
way down and they

00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:34,559
get some notes so it's kind of like a

00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,839
game so this is what the user sees they

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:46,049
put some notes by no timing like

00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:49,499
messages like let's go back okay so the

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:52,229
idea is very simple they say okay so I'm

00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:54,690
now displaying three three messages for

00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:56,459
the to a user but what they're doing

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,159
what they are doing behind the scene is

00:24:56,459 --> 00:25:01,709
reserving some notes on top of that and

00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,559
some notes just below that so basically

00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:07,589
when the user goes up it will get it

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,759
will reuse those free notes on top of

00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,649
that and will display the right

00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,479
information and when it goes down it

00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:14,190
will do exactly the same and that's a

00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:16,200
way basically anytime that you're

00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,450
getting or displaying one new message

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,989
it will not create a new note because

00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:23,879
creating new notes is has a price in

00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:25,709
terms of like resources from the CPU and

00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:28,679
resources of the browser so that's what

00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:30,450
they do they put a set amount of notes

00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:34,289
and they are starting to reuse that is

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:37,409
is really interesting and I also suggest

00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:38,909
you guys to take a look to them to the

00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:47,129
library and the way they implement

00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:49,589
things let's go alright so kind of my my

00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:53,249
takeaway from that is that infinitely

00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:56,879
infinitely are greedy so be careful with

00:25:53,249 --> 00:26:00,570
them so five simplify your code write

00:25:56,879 --> 00:26:02,099
less that may sound like simpler or kind

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,839
of like arrive whatever yeah I would

00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:05,549
write less code but it's true

00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,399
so basically kind of my takeaway from

00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:10,799
that lesson was the less you write the

00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:13,829
less code you write the faster will be

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:16,979
the parsing and the rendering so they

00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:20,909
the faster is gonna finish the parse the

00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:22,379
faster is gonna finish the parser and

00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:24,419
also it's real important to remove

00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:26,369
unnecessary dependencies and code so

00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,719
there are some tools out there like you

00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:29,429
can random basically understand all

00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,829
right so I'm not using this part of this

00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:34,109
other part but like honestly when I was

00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:36,479
like preparing this talk and I reviewed

00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:38,669
like what I did with with my website I

00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:40,529
found like why I'm importing this

00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:42,690
library or why I'm doing this or that

00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:43,980
and I realized alright I'm not using

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,470
those resources anymore

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,299
make sense to keep having like to be

00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,540
part of the bundle to occupy the space

00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:53,730
and with these like you can do that

00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,620
exercise and you will be surprised and

00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,020
also something that I learned that I

00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:02,370
wasn't aware before and is basically

00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,290
when writing CSS the more kind of

00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,179
nesting and different selectors that you

00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:09,000
write here and and this is of course

00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:12,380
kind of like a crazy example I just do

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,840
for this um the worst because basically

00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,640
what I told before about the way the

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,230
browser creates the the tree with the

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,750
CSS it will go

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,760
bbbbb and you know go ahead like it's

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:29,309
easier to find these but then these

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:32,360
indeed that it takes more time so take

00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:35,760
away the shorter your CSS selectors are

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,799
the faster the browser will apply their

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,650
styles

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,600
alright this point also weird for a

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:46,710
technical talk take a coffee with

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:48,450
packing fox so I like this memory

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,570
because it's kind of like yeah scalene

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:53,940
and just add Freddie's so something that

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:56,400
I daring a person operate that IDs that

00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:59,400
I did so the idea of daily focus was

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,650
this was like my email eyes a mass in my

00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,230
last year of the university I did this

00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:06,840
project so the idea was basically

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,700
integrating third-party services like

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,600
social networks like Facebook Twitter

00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,760
Gmail also creating new services on the

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,070
go for example the Bitcoin service to

00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:20,820
read Bitcoin news I need to grade those

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:22,860
in the same place and help people to be

00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,559
productive when dealing with information

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,210
when dealing with projects and and that

00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:30,240
was the idea and it was really cool

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:32,160
because for example I found a way to

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,919
create new functionalities on top of

00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,010
Gmail for example so it's not in this

00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,500
screen but all the email conversations

00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:43,230
that you have was where compare it in to

00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,179
chat with idea of like seemed faster the

00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,809
content and and have more like a look

00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,080
and feel like

00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:51,360
let's reply quick so the bank challenge

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,630
with daily focus is that creating this

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,909
field which is first row is acquiring to

00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,539
multiple third-party services is

00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:59,789
acquiring

00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:02,519
Gmail is a word into Facebook is up

00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:05,580
wearing to debate canoes takes time and

00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,009
it's costly so I couldn't basically say

00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:12,059
anytime that the user hits my websites I

00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:13,769
will really read recreate the feet this

00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,659
is something it's like this is exactly

00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:18,690
what Twitter does like datin RiRi

00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:20,639
creates all the time with timelines they

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,350
basically cache and create the timelines

00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:24,749
for a certain hours or for certain days

00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:29,759
and that's what how do they get that

00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:31,950
fast first reply so I did I did the same

00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,950
for my project and it was really cool so

00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:38,039
they take away from this is when it

00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:40,440
comes to web performance sometimes it's

00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:43,619
not only something that you should do in

00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,539
the front end sometimes takes you need

00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:46,889
to talk with back-end people sometimes

00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:49,019
it's a problem that you need to solve

00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:50,820
with other folks so it's just not only

00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:52,830
hey we are front-end engineers we are

00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,840
here we don't talk with anybody else and

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,279
we don't care no it's all about

00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,649
collaboration it's all about teamwork

00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:02,099
and it's all about knowing exactly how

00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:02,929
to tackle problems no matter what they

00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:07,049
are

00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:08,879
ok so let's like we recap for me those

00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:12,809
are like kind of my main takeaways from

00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:16,470
this talk from what I said so first one

00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:19,950
is measure compared to a take action the

00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:21,359
second one is don't do prematurely I

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:25,590
don't know how to pronounce that but

00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:27,419
don't don't optimize just because it's

00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,499
cool optimize because it makes sense for

00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:31,529
you and for your business

00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:34,139
the third is less code is equals so

00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:37,499
better if the code is readable and is

00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:39,989
okay anyway and then for is be empathic

00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:41,519
with your customers and for me that's

00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:43,379
really really really important to

00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,799
understand okay so this is some kind of

00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:48,779
resources so for example like the 18

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,029
point web performance eglee's by arias

00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:52,619
mary this is this guy talks a lot about

00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:55,349
that so it's a really cool guy to follow

00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:57,029
on twitter and then like other resources

00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:58,259
by the way this one is called from

00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:01,169
front-end masters I don't know if you

00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:03,450
know that that website but is really

00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:06,599
cool really high quality shows and they

00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:08,970
are not paying me for saying this okay

00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:10,730
then in my website if you go to Ferrara

00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,910
let me go performance

00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:15,730
I wrote a blog post about these so there

00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:19,490
are more stuff that I didn't cover today

00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:21,530
so you can go there and uncheck that I'm

00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:24,950
talking yeah like immature sprite use

00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:28,250
SVG I had to load like a synchronously

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:30,200
CSS and JavaScript so if you want to

00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,700
take a look just go there and if you

00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,010
have some questions later on you can

00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,620
write me on Twitter or or by email

00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:40,550
whatever so the last kind of code for DS

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:42,620
is of course like think measure compare

00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:45,350
repeat and always think about the

00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:49,690
business so thank you very much

00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:49,690
