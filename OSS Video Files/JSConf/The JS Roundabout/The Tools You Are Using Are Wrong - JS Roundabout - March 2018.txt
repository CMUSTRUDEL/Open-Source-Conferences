hello hi everyone we are here to tell

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,200
you why you are wrong yeah because I

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,210
think Jules and JavaScript are just like

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,469
driving a car when you know how to drive

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,870
a car no one else around you knows how

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,639
to drive a car just us you are the only

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,780
one person in the whole world that knows

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,180
how to drive a car

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,680
Enzo we know how to write JavaScript and

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,300
you don't and we also know there's right

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,650
cars do you have a license I do the

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,300
license she has a license I used to have

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,519
a car - oh cool

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,160
anyway this is us I'm Ellie I work

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,349
downstairs at train line I'm a front-end

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,690
developer which makes me an expert so

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,170
everything I say is right and everything

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,180
you think is wrong also we're on a state

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,690
let's pretend this is a stage so

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,370
obviously we know enough Ellie come on

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,070
I'm like one six Oh

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,950
so I'm Sarah I work in yld which is like

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,989
five minutes away so pretty huge right

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,329
as well and I am also a front-end

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,129
developer there and I'm an expert

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,340
front-end developer so as you can see my

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,100
photos are conference so pretty

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,399
expert guys I know what the I'm

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,630
doing

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,729
all's same yeah okay so no we can start

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,170
yeah good so our first thing is package

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,369
managers let's talk about package

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,049
manager yeah I guess twitter hasn't

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,430
talked about it enough right if you work

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,880
with JavaScript you need to manage your

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,650
packages you do you need to manage your

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,090
packages in real life like I didn't lose

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,040
manage your packages we don't want you

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,960
to do it wrong so let's talk about NPM

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,579
and yarn I mean does anyone wanna talk

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,540
about Bower cuz we're super into that as

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,700
well don't they have the parrot stickers

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,540
is that them not against you oh no

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,840
that's Bower that's power

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,920
yeah that's not pretty anyway let me

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,430
tell you about MPM NPM is amazing NPM is

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,110
a classic NPM is the og package manager

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,470
didn't know gee killed his wife or

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:56,490
something

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:59,490
Shh he was innocent you should be using

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:03,869
NPM for all of your projects you're not

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,119
using NPM you are wrong um here is an

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,069
amazing tweet screenshot from one of the

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,250
people that work on NPM who is very

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,349
smart much smarter than all of you not

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,400
us though and there explain

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:19,739
and you can see they explain that MPM is

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,709
slightly slower but it's much more

00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:25,049
dependable like a you know like an old

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:28,739
friend like an old car as well yeah

00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:31,079
exactly exactly it still says um if you

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,930
want your app to be stable you should

00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:35,549
use NPM okay but what if I'm just what

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,590
if I have other things to do in life so

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:40,829
I'm defending yarn cuz yarn is dope it's

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,389
much fast it's so fast you can't even

00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:45,269
see like you go yarn install and I

00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:47,609
should just like whoa it's dope ok and

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,169
so also NPM does that really up

00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:51,599
thing we're like if you have your yarn

00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,799
stuff and then you run npm install lo -

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,349
for example cuz you wanna install the

00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:57,269
entire internet so npm install or add it

00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:59,189
deletes all of your yarn stuff and it

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,019
just installed slow - and nothing works

00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,030
on your website and that's not it that's

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:07,319
that's not cool well II know so clearly

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,939
don't use yarn yeah obviously yeah you

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,189
use NPM alone it won't break your stuff

00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:16,949
actually brawler will anyway but that's

00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:20,819
not its reliable am i crying from a joke

00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:23,489
or the pizza it's okay my pizza was

00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,739
really spicy so also like it works

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:28,349
offline like if you're in a plane in

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,909
words I think I've never tried it but I

00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,419
think it works I'm pretty sure your

00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,530
words and like there's a second time

00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:36,689
when you're still offline it doesn't

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,819
matter like okay ever like how much you

00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:40,409
code on a plane really versus how much

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,669
you want your app to be reliable I'm

00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,930
just saying I'm just saying you know I

00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:44,970
think it's way more important for your

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,379
app to be like go get on a plane also

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,780
does this really cool thing which ate

00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,310
yarn upgrade interactive it's fine yeah

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,560
it's it's dope shut up

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,970
so basically you run yarder interactive

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,889
and there's this things that tell you

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,469
like this is a patch update this is a

00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,939
minor and I didn't have a major update

00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,790
but it tells you all the things and you

00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,709
just like dab your way through it and

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,180
just press the space key and you select

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,349
all the things and you click enter so

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:14,129
obviously if you're using NPN like dude

00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:16,769
dude it's 2018 right whatever right okay

00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,209
cool let's talk about semicolons because

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,250
I

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,080
semicolons are a very contentious issue

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,570
in the JavaScript world engines even

00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,210
meeting though but it's highly debated I

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:31,130
guess I think right now that neither was

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:33,340
her native English um you you have to

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:38,240
use semicolons semicolons are amazing

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:40,640
semicolons sick mmm tc39 if the

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,750
JavaScript overlords recommend you to

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,710
use semicolons

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:47,330
therefore you should use semicolons you

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,220
can avoid errors you can avoid

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,550
unexpected behavior it's a nice little

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,890
end to your you know line life um it's

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,270
safer you won't get these weird bugs

00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,610
that you don't know where they came from

00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,180
it never happens that happens all the

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,180
time

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,340
we never happens tc39 they are

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,350
JavaScript you know leaders thought

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,670
leaders and they say you should use

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,100
semicolons if you're not using

00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,390
semicolons you're wrong I just want to

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,590
point out the react felt leaders that's

00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,960
following me on Twitter so technically

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,170
I'm a thought leader as well same

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,240
okay so first of all like JavaScript as

00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,910
a CI which means like semicolons are not

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,590
necessary this is like you have been

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,360
lied to like the only reason I don't use

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,590
semicolons is because when I do learn

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,540
JavaScript everyone told me that I

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,650
needed to use semicolons and then I saw

00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,660
this tutorial and the guy was like oh

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,400
semicolons I'm not necessarily just

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,010
reminded me of all the lies my mom told

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,830
me when I was a kid and I just felt

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,580
betrayed I did were you laughing I'm not

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,070
happening I'm crying

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,840
oh that's cool and I don't know I just

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,310
felt betrayed and I was like no I don't

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,630
need semi code they're so pretty it's

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,400
like when you move out of your

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,380
grandparents house and you live in this

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,570
really cool hipster house and like

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,460
everything is just so pretty it's just

00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,320
it's so much better like there are three

00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,510
occasions where you're like it up

00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,640
but you'll never find them actual

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,040
because you have the absolute atomic yes

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,840
lint

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:10,700
yes lint so basically if you're using

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,470
semi cannot using semicolons dude 2018

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,909
let's talk about frameworks let's talk

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,379
about frameworks

00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:19,110
the tenant no I'm kidding we just picked

00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,150
four okay so we have react

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,879
who's up for reais put your hands up

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,159
team react to react yay

00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,020
we have pre-act we have view and we have

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,490
angular since none of us has actually

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,650
worked with anything after angular 1

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,650
this will be related to only angular 1

00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:38,099
only angular 1 because we didn't want to

00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,960
show you on something don't ever use

00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,440
talk about what you know okay yeah

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,270
exactly

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,129
we're experts but not in that yeah yeah

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,690
we just it's the one thing yeah we don't

00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:49,919
know angler so react

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:53,400
it's very nice yes it's so nice yes go

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,870
it's declarative it's easy to use it's

00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,199
the hot new thing on the block

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,879
everyone's using it it's a very easy to

00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,889
create apps with react react has

00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,169
honestly been like a super huge

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:07,860
game-changer for to the JavaScript

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:10,080
industry also all the jobs are in react

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,030
now so you can get money real money

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,979
which you can exchange for goods and

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,819
services so obviously if you're not

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,560
using react

00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:23,190
you're not only wrong but you're poor

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,380
and sad and sad yeah you're everything

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,659
so I'm a pre X advocate I think I can

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,669
say this so first of all it's much

00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:31,349
dining no I think there's only one more

00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,479
slide we don't don't worry about it's

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:35,219
much tiny like the syntax is very cool

00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,319
it's very familiar to react so you get

00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,639
like the best of both worlds like you

00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,250
can use all the cool things that we I

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,990
TAS in a much tiny thing yep oh

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,099
that's other selection I mean smaller is

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:49,050
not always better but you know it's fine

00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:51,479
what are you talking about um bundles

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,669
Oman the sizes okay oh so you're not

00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,940
some really cool things to do do it do

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:59,069
react like why would you not use it like

00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,740
it's smaller a bumble sized it's smaller

00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:04,319
AIT's a sometime what you never used it

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,819
I've used it one you guys never want to

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,969
react up and I try to change and it

00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:13,409
broke and I was upset that's fine I'm

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:16,469
sorry okay so view view it's must fast

00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:19,800
view is so fast view super fast

00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:21,419
also I feel like view is like the kitten

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,029
of frameworks is like the Harry Potter

00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:25,740
of web frameworks everyone loves it no

00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:27,300
one like you either

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,460
I've never met anyone that hates Harry

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,370
Potter I have never does anyone okay

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,320
cool dude get out dude come on you

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,690
either know it and love it or you just

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,250
haven't read it haven't heard of it like

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,270
those are the two states there is no

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,800
hate with you

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,660
there's no hate it's like a little kid

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,560
in a web development also I just want to

00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,990
say that they're Docs

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,820
I like awesome if they put Google

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,190
AdWords on that that that would be

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,490
doop you either love them or you haven't

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,990
read them true true true true also I

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,150
think if you're not using viewer I think

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,950
you're slightly wrong it's probably

00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,630
wrong probably wrong she'd ever used to

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:05,630
you yeah so angular one

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:08,779
[Laughter]

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:11,060
oh my god and go 2-1 does anyone

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,339
remember route scope and set timeouts

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,470
and yeah that was though about that

00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:19,880
let's talk about state management oh my

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:21,709
gosh thank you um I know this this

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,740
theory is actually from the talk now I'm

00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:26,899
sorry um alright so there's like two big

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,519
players we want to talk about and tell

00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:32,630
you why you're wrong

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:35,449
Redux and mob X lots of X's there you

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:38,899
know what I'm saying um Redux is amazing

00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:42,800
Redux is the thing right it's immutable

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:46,550
it has amazing dev tools Dan Abramov is

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:51,649
on Twitter like it's really suspenseful

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:54,949
is a delight she is a delight everyone

00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:57,319
is using it so again jobs money not

00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:59,930
being poor all of those amazing things a

00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:02,120
house having a house it's a great

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,560
solution actually technically it's a

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,380
great solution and I know because I'm an

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,389
expert so really you should be using

00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,899
Redux for your state management please

00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,639
don't

00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,689
you're wrong if you're not ok so first

00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,310
of all I just wanna say that I hate

00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:14,689
Redux because you have to change four

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,970
files to change an object and that hurts

00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:25,699
my feelings so much because that's not

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:28,220
the way life works and also my leg is

00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:29,540
like oh my god it's so nice like it's so

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,160
nice it's just so pretty

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,420
it's so pretty like the code is just

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,459
nice it's just you know you don't have

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,779
to change one file you get to go home

00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:38,269
early because you don't have to change

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:40,069
the other files the other three files so

00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:42,529
you only do like 25% of the work it's

00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:45,439
dope you should see it like also I get

00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,850
paid by the month not by the hour so it

00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:49,430
doesn't it's not really good for me to

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,959
use redox I'll get paid the same so if I

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:55,939
got paid by the hour if you get paid by

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,500
the hour use Redux swear you swear to

00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:00,019
you that app is gonna fill in your

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,149
pockets like crazy wait can I how many

00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:06,560
of your contractors how many of you get

00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:09,019
paid by DL use redox radix is dope it's

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,550
super reactive like you change one thing

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,410
in one file and you're like updates in

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,350
the in the other one we're just two

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,870
files because the stories and objects

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,240
and not some weird thing and why isn't

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,580
it more popular you know what I'm

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,330
it is it is it's more popular than you

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:27,459
know if you're not using marvex you work

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:30,700
by the hour basically so let's talk

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:33,190
about types who whose a type person was

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,520
a Thai person are you have like three

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,620
friends le gonna convince the rest types

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,230
are amazing what are you doing having a

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,540
life look I'm not gonna get into the

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,920
whole typescript verses flow thing I

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,680
think both are great

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,330
I think typed JavaScript is the future

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:55,000
and the way to go you stitch

00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:57,839
so basically types find all your

00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,850
fuck-ups before the internet does soul I

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,670
mean I don't have any I'm an expert but

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,490
if I did like Sarah I would get

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:09,790
real-time feedback on what went wrong

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,440
before I even run my ass you know what

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,420
things are it's great for big teams for

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,580
communication it's great for

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:19,600
understanding what your code is doing to

00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:21,880
what when and I think if for any app

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,570
bigger than like us you know listening

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:28,950
box yeah you need types and if you're

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:32,170
not using types you're definitely wrong

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,850
definitely please know your size okay so

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,170
first of all no one wants to learn two

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,540
different languages are basically the

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:43,959
same language that's why reason is not

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:46,329
picking up it's not that's not okay so

00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:48,220
like the thing about types is that like

00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,320
it's imagine that you install lodash and

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,720
he doesn't have like it's not a site not

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,610
a nice typing's but it does okay imagine

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,440
that it doesn't fine okay so imagine

00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,880
that you write a frame a librarian

00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,709
someone is like oh dude this doesn't

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,140
work which I you had a right to types I

00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:04,209
had to do that for flow that was not fun

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,860
that was not fun at all that was way

00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:08,440
worse than Google Analytics and I hate

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,700
Google Analytics trust me I'm not fun I

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,470
hate it oh my god it's so glad I know

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,720
it's so much faster to develop things

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,190
when you don't have any types they're

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,589
not fast if it breaks though you know

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,089
what I'm saying defense defense depends

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:24,160
on I mean we're experts are things don't

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,709
break but you guys will promote break

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,390
stuff so come on don't lie to us there

00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:30,279
is actually like no proof that is

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,529
actually better to develop with types I

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:34,359
develop with types and I can tell you

00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:36,189
better from experience and I know

00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:39,339
everything so there you go

00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:42,009
science fact okay what's our capital

00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:46,839
Bulgaria anyway this is a picture of

00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:49,269
nothing it's a black square of nothing

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,189
yeah just new JavaScript Elliot you

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,199
would not look any ties yeah okay I'm

00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:54,939
just I'm just gonna lay this out here

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,099
I'm just sayin cyan all their real

00:13:54,939 --> 00:14:01,209
languages use x so I don't know like

00:13:57,099 --> 00:14:03,549
what not in front of company

00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:05,439
darling okay so let's talk about editors

00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:09,729
editors we actually both like the same

00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:11,229
editor like America great oh my god is V

00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:13,569
s oh my god it's so cool

00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:16,659
it is amazing oh my god PS code people

00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:20,159
in the house yes yeah the

00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:20,159
rest of you using Adams

00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:23,499
that's cool

00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:27,119
Adams cool as well I'm fine without Adam

00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:34,139
Adam sublime Oh yours is webstorm dude

00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:41,199
IntelliJ Oh notepad plus plus yeah

00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:43,629
Microsoft Word the dev tools and pro um

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,369
Gnaeus code is great it's free I mean it

00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:47,470
has amazing type support it has like

00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:49,089
intellisense so you can get previews and

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,879
it previews your imports and you can

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,499
click through to things oh it's so good

00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:55,509
I know it's also like Microsoft is an

00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:56,859
evil anymore it doesn't break all the

00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:58,809
time like some of the other ones yeah

00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:00,849
they're getting better every other evil

00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:02,919
anymore no no it's what Apple is evil

00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:05,529
who's evil No I can't just read like if

00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:07,089
you touched my laptop the new ones yeah

00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,639
that's not cool so far he is the new ie

00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:12,189
so far it shows on you IE oh my god dude

00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:15,279
yeah you're a girl sorry I'm heart emoji

00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:17,319
times 2 because we both love it

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,029
I know right and we count each one of us

00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:21,399
counts us to emoji we strongly feel that

00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:22,779
if you are not using this code you are

00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,489
wrong yeah two experts saying the same

00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:27,999
thing double run alright so let's talk

00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:30,669
about vim who loves vim though ok cool

00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,949
cool ok everyone loves vim but who uses

00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:35,729
on a daily basis like to code who knows

00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,729
how to quit vim

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,330
five people five people know how to put

00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,520
them okay no I don't believe this

00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:44,340
how do you quit them yeah somebody

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,520
anybody nobody says how you give him any

00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,130
okay good okay I would quit and save on

00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,540
him

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:54,270
murmurs everyone looks at their nails

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,890
like mmm no boy okay so the thing about

00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,720
them is that it takes you an entire

00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:02,370
Court is that that is like Amazon

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,590
de velas like loud Amazon wife services

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:07,920
hey don't the West yes I want for

00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:09,480
joining you know usual earning curve do

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,220
nothing things like a dictionary of

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,660
stuff and I swear to God that how to

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,820
quit vim is like one of the most such

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,100
things on Stack Overflow I think is like

00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,080
most views and then the entire country

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,150

any

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,860
if you spend time formatting you're not

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,900
doing your job and again back to the

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,500
money jobs thing you know real money not

everyone loves CSS right oh my god we

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,140
have one hand actually like CSS it's

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:15,010
fine don't worry you're not alone in the

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:16,720
world so CSS vs. CSS nsj yeah I don't

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,840
know okay I think it's pick this one

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,030
okay I love CSS it's amazing it's much

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,610
faster to render it's much easier to

00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:28,660
pick up if you learn CSS before the

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:30,070
whole react you know world yeah um you

00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,800
already know it you don't have a

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:35,340
literally with jQuery that's Asus I know

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:40,390
right yeah MySpace what do you query

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:42,820
myspace yes there's less tooling I was

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:46,750
friends with Tom on myspace oh my god

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:48,340
who - I'm special you can use the

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:51,130
correct casing for the properties that

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,290
you see on the browser oh my god like do

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,570
that with good snake case what snake

00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,550
case case the bad case instead of like

00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,290
the big little thing you don't have to

00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,360
put quotes around values you can just

00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:09,670
tell it what the value is you know like

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:11,980
every use cell components it's the real

00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,590
CSS like you don't want any of those

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,560
poster libraries that the maintainer is

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:21,790
gonna get bored and quit and left pad

00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:24,430
all over the place okay so first of all

00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:26,050
what CSS and Jas is amazing okay so

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,790
first of all you get like if statements

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:30,220
in CSS which I come on it's a dream

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,650
that's true that it's I gotta give it to

00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,090
you I do like if statements if statement

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,960
I like it more than most other

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:46,780
statements what are the other statements

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:48,430
while loops only try catch okay so you

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,840
can actually server-side render with CSI

00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,730
CJ yes most of the libraries lay you

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,720
server-side rendered that thing word is

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,800
like oh my god but it doesn't

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,970
server-side rendering dude you're not

00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,290
checking the internet you gotta check

00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,640
the internet rule number one of life

00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,650
always check the Internet rule number

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,660
two always believe the internet the

00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,620
Internet is always right yeah you are

00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,590
always wrong

00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,059
rule number three CSS nsj is awesome

00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,440
some of them some of the tools are

00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,690
actually smarter than us like this is

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,420
tool called fella was like if you use

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,950
but it's the same thing like margin top

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,690
10 pixels all over the thing it actually

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,220
creates like helper classes for you so

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,559
you don't have to do it and download

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,450
tachyons attackers is the best by the

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,960
way interesting yeah I know I'll look

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,680
into it

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,700
what tachyons yeah yeah Auto prefixes

00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,680
all your things so you don't have to

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,910
auto prefix all the things when I join

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,950
my old company they didn't have how to

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,510
prefix all my field on a on Safari

00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,030
I mean obviously use all of it

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:38,679
developing for Chrome only exactly like

00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,780
it's Firefox if it works on the first

00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,760
try the new Firefox the new fire for ya

00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,540
the quantum one yeah the black one the

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,250
quantum quantum quantum its component

00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,360
base like it's good probably like you

00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,470
make your component and then you make

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,450
the size of your component and then you

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,429
have a component it's dope I think it's

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:59,110
like if you're using CSS like it doesn't

00:20:54,429 --> 00:21:00,790
make an if statements if F in statements

00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,470
who doesn't want have statements in CSS

00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,700
what does it more happiness in CSS by

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:08,080
the way so let's talk about animals now

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,600
you want to feel very strongly about

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,820

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:31,450
cats so no listen

00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:33,000
dogs are these amazing fluff balls and

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,350
they love you back

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,240
unconditionally and when you get home

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,550
you are the best thing that has ever

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,950
happened to them in the universe

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,240
they love cuddles and they will cuddle

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,830
with you when you want to cuddle with

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,870
them not when they want to cuddle with

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,400
you you know what I mean like that's

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,670
what people are for if you want to be

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,440
angry anyway cats are mean they throw

00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,120
 on the ground and they're like

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,640
Ebola they're like watching your every

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,929
move and when you slip they strike you

00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:04,179

and walk you then you better love me

00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:07,900
unconditionally I'm just saying so we

00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,670
just realized that she hates humans in

00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,440
general because cats are basically

00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,010
humans I guess our personalities except

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,240
for you directly if you're punching

00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,770
in the face don't please don't punch a

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,970
guy in the face like that's not cool we

00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,140
do not recommend it we do not worry

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,210
around anywhere punching a kind of face

00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,190
well if you accidentally step on it or

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,230
something's gonna be pissed like a you

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,850
one yeah then you spend all this time

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,550

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:47,630
I don't know okay so first of all cats

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,310

can't find anything else to do with them

00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,980
it's like you can't love them and they

00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,690
won't love you back so might as well

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:03,590

lot but it's friendly fighting what what

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,420
I've never been told about this part the

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,790
if you're on the Twitter or on Stack

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:47,180
Overflow or on the Internet in general

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,590
you will see a lot of these points and

00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,490
you will be told that you're wrong and

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:55,640
you probably are but in all seriousness

00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:58,130
now and I'm using my serious voice it

00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,770
doesn't matter what you use you can use

00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,610
whatever you want whatever you choose

00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,260
it's fine

00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,420
do not let the internet tell you

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,850
otherwise do not let some random yelling

00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,770
girls tell you otherwise there's a lot

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,110
of hate in JavaScript these days and in

00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,580
Twitter and everyone's like oh Redux is

00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:17,300
