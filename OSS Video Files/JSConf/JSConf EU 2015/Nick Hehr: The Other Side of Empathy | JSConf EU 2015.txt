Title: Nick Hehr: The Other Side of Empathy | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-07
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	In an industry that is so focused frameworks & tooling, we tend to lose sight of the people behind the products and how we work with them. I’ve found empathy to be a powerful resource while collaborating with teams inside companies and across the open source community. By breaking down The Other Side of Empathy, I will demonstrate how applying its principles to your development process will benefit the community and the products they create.

Hello. So, yes, who am I? As Alex said, I am Nick Hehr. I am first and foremost and

00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:46,030
empathetic community member and next I am a Front‑End developer at a company called

00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,440
namely, I'm also a Disney fan, that's topical, if you want to talk to me later about

00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:57,579
something, huge fan of the parks and movies, I'm also a bouldering enthusiast, pretty big

00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:04,830
here in Berlin and Germany in general, and New York as well, where I'm from. And if you

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:17,009
haven't noticed yet, I have petty wicked mustache. Oh, no, is the animation not working

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,030
(Wicked). But important thing about this, it's not to

00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,350
be touched, you wouldn't believe how many times I've had to tell people that. (Laughing)

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:33,300
Jan knows what I'm talking about. So, why do I care about what I'm speaking about today,

00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:41,509
why do I care about empathy in general? And I care because my badge ground is actually

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:47,840
in psychology, and degree in leadership as well, so a lot around people and how people

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:56,209
work together it's very important to Maine as part of my job professionally, I'm in constant

00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:02,170
collaboration with designers to make sure that their visual ideas get Translated to

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:08,220
the pages very efficiently and well. And also working with back‑end developers to make

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,230
sure the data thaw create on the API side comes to the Front‑End and is communicated

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:21,330
back and forth efficiently at the same time. And then, I also love the community. This

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,980
is one of the reasons I chose to keep working and as soon as I started learning about web

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,409
development and continued working in that community because it's just so nice. And I

00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:37,790
love every part of the community, it's just so much fun for me. And then there's this

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,340
very specific group of people that should care about this, about empathy in general

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:56,430
and that's everybody. Siriusly (Laughing). But that is empathy? Empathy is the ability

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:03,379
to understand and share the feelings of another. If anyone saw Myles talk had gentlemen correctJS

00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:11,180
it's feeling with someone else, not for someone else. And it's a very widely talked about

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:17,170
tool or resource for designers, and we'll talk about it a lot just being empathetic

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,959
for your users and feeling how they would feel, and seeing the world through the eyes

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,870
of someone else in order to create the best user experience for them. But, how can we

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,749
take this and apply it to how we work with other people? And how can we make our products

00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:43,450
so much better by doing this? Because we're so focused on tools these days that, and there's

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:49,819
just wonderful, how can we also focus on the people behind those tools. That's kind of

00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:55,040
around where empathy ‑‑ the other side of empathy comes from and this concept. And

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,010
first it came from using Twitter. I love Twitter, it's such a great resource and medium for

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:07,129
connecting with people and learning more about the community, but, there's a lot of people

00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:14,569
out there, and it's sometimes leads to some snap judgements because it's so easy to put

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:20,810
your thoughts out there and just fire off a quick tweet into the Ether that someone

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:28,310
will read. And eventually those someones create some kind of mob mentality that really just

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,970
starts to bumble me out, I think it bumbles a lot of people out, toking on‑line and

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:40,060
going on Twitter, I think we need to be more careful and take more care in order to make

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,570
this a better experience for everyone. And so, I kind of broke down the other side of

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:56,050
empathy into four main tenants. And that comes down to context, constructive feedback, communication,

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:03,030
and caring. And so I tell you all of this to give you some context about why I'm up

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,540
here and what I'm speaking about. And why you all should care about what I'm speaking

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:15,810
about. And so context is all these internal and external things that influence how we

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:23,880
make decisions and how we take actions, and how we affect others around us. And it relates

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,670
to the other side of empathy mostly because you gnaw have heard un‑opinionuated frameworks

00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:35,500
or libraries or things like that. But no one is un‑opinionuated, the fact they chose

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,910
to use small module or framework is an opinion, or to structure something one way or another

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:46,970
is an opinion. Is no un‑opinionuated opinions (Laughs)

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,110
and we all have biases from either the conscious or unconscious, they come from somewhere,

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:59,830
it's important to recognize that, where they come from, when they happen. And listening,

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:05,660
that's super key to get context from anyone, if you want to get it, you have to listen,

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:12,460
and in order to get, that sometimes you have to ask why. Why do we do all these things?

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,440
Why does this happen? Why did you chose that structure over this structure, this framework

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,750
over that framework. And by doing this, we can set the example for others. And set the

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,950
example for gaining context, encouraging it from others. And we ‑‑ I do this at work,

00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:37,770
and we we do this together using user stories, when cryuating features or work flows, has

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:44,270
anyone herd of Gherkin before? Yes, raise your hands? Awesome. Gherkin is pretty saw

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,050
some, not just for testing but for gaining context from the people you're working with.

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:56,330
It captures the who, what and why of a requirement in such a simple way. And it's not only trying

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,210
to think of the users, but we also are ‑‑ our own biases influences the kind of Gherkin

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:10,990
statements that we make to recognize what a user or yourself would want. And we're all

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,460
at this conference today, we all have opinions, biases, it's important to remember context

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,900
when we go around today at breaks or at the parties or throughout the entire what the

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:27,720
FEST and when doing that, when you hear something that may differ from your own opinion, it's

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,610
important to take a deep breath and then clear your mind of any of those biases, recognize

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:40,520
that they're there, but just try to push them aside for a second. Ask why, remember just

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,900
be sincere, you want to know why they did this. And then listen. And through that, you

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:53,260
might start gaining some constructive feedback. And now, constructive feedback is very important,

00:07:53,260 --> 00:08:02,050
that word "constructive" it's not criticism, it's not negative feedback, and being constructive

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,460
is getting information that should help you move forward or improve. It's not meant to

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:14,750
just say, this is what's wrong, it's supposed to say this could be changed this way I'll

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:21,840
go further into that. But first how many of you all remember the golden rule? If you don't

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:29,050
have anything nice to say, don't say it at all. Yeah. Well, somewhere between when we

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:35,820
learn that and maybe primary school, kindergarten, and somewhere along the way through maybe

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:44,589
middle school or secondary school we tend to forget that. We don't really remember that

00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:49,170
rule or interacting with others as we get older and go into the workforce or interacting

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,459
with other people in the community. And it's nays to remember not to say if you don't have

00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:59,329
anything nice to say ‑‑ but in the context of empathy, I want to change it a little and

00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:04,199
say if you tonight have anything constructive to say, then don't say anything at all. Not

00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:09,889
saying something nice isn't good, but in the terms of getting good constructive feedback,

00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:15,170
we want to get constructive feedback saying that's awesome! Doesn't move it forward, that's

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,279
the important part about this tenant. It's moving something forward for the better to

00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:27,470
improve upon. And some say negative feedback can do that too, I mean, I go to Twitter sometimes

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:33,160
and I see people who have a snap judgments where it's just like this is awful, and it's

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,999
like, can you tell me why it's awful? Can you tell me more? And they say, it's ‑‑

00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:46,839
the negative tweets will help influence the designers or developers behind such a product,

00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,889
but good feedback, good constructive feedback takes more than 140 characters, even less

00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:58,959
than that when you mention the company or the developers or the designers. And sometimes

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:09,129
they agree, but, they don't necessarily follow through. Or we don't. And constructive feedback

00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:17,050
is importantly a mutually agreed upon event. It is set up with the expectations that you

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:23,360
are getting feedback, that we're getting feedback. It's in an open space, not necessarily physically,

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,220
but somewhere that someone can feel like they can remove themselves pretty simply and it's

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,050
also shared with context. We give our context behind our constructive feedback in order

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,829
to make ‑‑ to help the others understand why we're giving it this way or what we're

00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:43,439
talking about. And a perfect situation for this, especially when working with others

00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:49,420
is code reviews. Either if you do this at work or part of an Open Source project, code

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,889
reviews are the perfect situation because they follow every part of that constructive

00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:02,529
feedback rules. It's intended to find mistakes and fix them and hope to improve, to push

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:11,569
forward, not just the quality of the software, but the developer skills as well. And it's,

00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:17,350
you have that dedicated meeting or dedicated time to come together and go over someone

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,059
else's project feature or code and it's coming from everyone in the project, not just developers,

00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:28,610
designers and manager's in hopes to give them an understanding of what's going on and hopefully

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:34,009
the questions they ask will help you understand your understanding of what you actually did.

00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:39,319
Many times we go through something it works maybe we're not sure why, they help us push

00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:44,540
forward and improve on that that's all about encouraging constructive feedback, we can

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:53,670
do it in the open in the community, and first and foremost with a contributing.md. If anyone

00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:59,980
knows what that is, it's a pretty awesome little trick with GitHub that if you add this

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:08,459
file to any Repo, it's automagically link opening an issue or pull request with that

00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:14,550
contributing MD file what it takes and what they're looking for when opening issue, opening

00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:21,550
a pull request, submitting code, and some of my favorites have been Atom, the Atom project

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:29,490
from GitHub. It's very thorough. It talks all about what they're lacking for from issues,

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,910
what they're looking for from code, style guides and things like that. It really helps

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,319
delay the shallow constructive feedback that comes from pull requests and issues and helps

00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:45,720
push forward to actual improvements that we want. Of course, I'm also a little biased

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,600
for Hoodie, it's such a great project and such a great contributing.md to help others

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,970
understand, even the READMEs are great contributing files, just in case people can't get to this

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:07,559
up front. And, this type of linking and medium is all about communication. And how to communicate

00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:14,550
with people. And it's important to remember that communication is sharing information

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:19,569
and ideas and feelings, especially in terms of empathy. If you're talking to someone,

00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:23,649
you're not necessarily communicating with them. You're just spitting ideas at them,

00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:27,899
and they're not taking them or sharing them if you have to remember how to receive ideas

00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:34,300
in order to communicate. And it's how we interact with each other in general. And it's what

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:40,410
we say, how we say it, and where we say it, like I said before, with the constructive

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:46,889
feedback, it's in a dedicated space or area that people feel comfortable in. How we saw

00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:53,999
it comes in the way we phrase things sometimes. "I" statements. That're great for giving constructive

00:13:53,999 --> 00:14:01,579
feedback, part of that context that we're giving. I noticed or I found before that this

00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:08,339
plug‑in tends to be a little inaccessible. But for getting context, it's not fantastic.

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:16,860
Oh, I don't do it that way or, I don't see how you could possibly do that ... but it's

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:23,660
great for "you" statements like why did you make that decision, why did you chose this

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,410
thing, for giving constructive feedback it's not. You picked the wrong plug‑in, you should

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:36,559
change it. Or you should chose the completely wrong coding style, you need to go fix it.

00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:44,220
That's not pushing people forward into improving. And the mediums which we communicate are very

00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:50,809
important to ‑‑ and at work we have several different platforms for communicating. In

00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:56,980
general we have slack, and I feigned slack to be one of the best tools out there, for

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,420
communicating just in general and keeping in touch with people. Stand ups, either on

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:09,759
some kind of video chat or in person is very nays for getting that face‑to‑face time,

00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,369
quick interactions and finding out what's going on with someone. Regarded discussions

00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:19,679
that you can reference later, GitHub issues or trouble card or issue tracker are great

00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:25,269
and some kind of long tomorrow or acinous communications that doesn't have to be triggers

00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:32,619
right I way or answered right away (Asynchronous) remembering these made yums helps us get the

00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:37,720
right communication methods and helps us get the right return of information that we're

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:44,110
expecting at the right time. We can create communication too, one of the words that I

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:53,139
hear a lot from people that is another bummer for me is "it sucks" I really don't like this

00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:59,850
because it eliminates any hope of improving upon anything. It's very negative. It doesn't

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,980
push people forward, and improving, and unless you're talking about something like DJ Roomba,

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:12,329
I don't want to hear about something sucks, it doesn't help me or others. And when we're

00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:18,489
using these open channels when communicating with a community, Slack is great, Gitter,

00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:25,819
which is kind of a Slack alternative on top of GitHub IRC has been around over and even

00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:31,649
GitHub issues are very important. Slack I really like because you can customize things

00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:39,290
to encourage better feedback and communication from your community. Recently we added a little

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:46,540
Slackbot that recognizes things like "sucks" and encouraging more description and feedback

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:52,129
in relation to that. And anyone can do that. It's very easy to do. You can add multiple

00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:58,529
integration that fit with how you want the community to act and communicate with you.

00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:03,269
And taking the time to do that is all about caring, taking the time to do any of this

00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:10,100
is all about caring. And caring is providing the needs of something, and generally showing

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,809
an interest in it. If we care about something, we're interested in it, we want to do something

00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:24,400
about it. And caring over all is sharing. It's listening again, always listening and

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,750
understanding. Like I said before, empathy is feeling and understanding with people,

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:41,200
not for people. And as such a minute detail that one word, but a super important. And

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,960
showing how much you care. Do you care enough to write a Blog post? To file an issue? How

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,750
much time do you have? Can you send an e‑mail. Is there an e‑mail available? Can you record

00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,830
screen cast, that's great. There's such great tools out there to quickly record even a Gif

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:06,279
or full screen cast that you can post to an issue or a pull request for what you're doing

00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:09,850
or when submitting a pull request. If you have time to fix 2 code if you know how to

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,419
do it. If you think their code is unstructured or using the wrong module, to you care enough

00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,340
to take the time, change that, submit a pull request and communicate with them to make

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,640
sure that if you're using it then you want it to be better and show it, show them how

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,370
you can make it better. And then very important to remember also, don't give in to the hate.

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:39,690
It leads 20 Dark Side. Yoda, he knew what he was talking about. It's such an important

00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:45,970
thing to remember, stay positive, encourage positivity in the community, and part of that,

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,710
and part of caring, putting time into something comes into documentation. At least for me

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:57,990
at work, I find it so important to remember this. Wikis, code comments, style guides,

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:05,169
pattern libraries, READMEs. Any of these things can help either new developers or veteran

00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:11,529
developers, reference old code, new code, and go through code reviews and get context

00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:17,990
from that right away and speed up the process maybe. Any little thing that we can add to

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:24,610
our project will helm tremendously and then remember to make issues for documentation

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:34,149
and keeping it up. And such a way of doing this helps exsimplify caring. And another

00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:40,220
way to do that even not just at work and but in the community is mentoring. Mentoring is

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,110
really interesting, you can have a mentor and men tee at the same time, we're all at

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:52,299
different stages in our skill set, and our skills (Mentee) in general, but do we remember

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:57,980
starting out and how much we wanted a mentor to learn from, we can be that for a junior

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:04,610
developer and a senior developer ahead of us be our mentor D you have a mentor when

00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:11,860
you started out? And how much did you want one? And did you want to learn? You can learn

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:19,390
from having a mentor, you can learn from having a Mentee. We saw earlier that teaching someone

00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:27,720
helps improve our understanding of a concept. It really helps push forward our understanding.

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,799
And in order to start contributing these ideas, these tenants to our companies, we can start

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,570
just by listening for a difficult start small. Start listening, maybe not always having to

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:45,970
voice an opinion, to voice a bias. And start applying these small examples that I talked

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:53,960
about before. Code reviews. Using the right channels, using the right statements. Starting

00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,139
off small and then remaining open to sharing, remaining open to listening and asking why.

00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:04,980
And for some people, it sounds like too much work, to keep remembering this, to keep remembering

00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,519
that oh, I have to remember to think about people, to care. Yes, that's Oooh, that's

00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:20,950
so much work. And to them I say, well, deal with it. Because by starting to apply empathy

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:26,389
to connect with others professionally at first, it leads us down this path to connecting with

00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:32,570
others personally. This is a small space and a small area to start out with. We all have

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,580
something in common when we start out with working on the web, working with products,

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,529
working with JavaScripts. That's that small connection that can lead to bigger connections

00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:47,289
and understanding others. And for following up, and following a resources, one of my favorites

00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:53,730
and probably the first place I go to is suggest for others is a book called practical empathy.

00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:01,029
This leads to more general examples and more general like research around working with

00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:06,919
others, and using empathy that way. While my example is more specific to our industry

00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:13,120
and development and design. And I also like to collect resources as well and recently,

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,690
used to be on my own web site,now I've decided to dedicate something else to that. So this

00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:24,299
went live yesterday, it's called the other side of empathy.com, just try to gather empathy

00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:30,600
on the web and share it with others and give people a place to find new resources, keep

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:37,460
up to date, with any medium, pod casts, Blog posts, research papers, videos. But it's also

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:45,460
available while I was lacking up this domain at more‑empathy.online. So I really like

00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:52,000
that, and I think you can access it anywhere and it describes what I'm trying to do, and

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,679
who I hope otherrings can try to do. I love hearing more about it. It's open, it's on

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,889
my GitHub, you can also suggest resources that way, improvements to make this more accessible

00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:07,330
