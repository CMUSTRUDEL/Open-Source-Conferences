Title: Etiene da Cruz Dalcol: What I learned teaching programming to 150 beginners | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-08
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	A few months ago I was invited to give a workshop at Women’s International Leadership Conference on Introduction to Programming. That was an amazing experience that taught me incredible things and motivated me to open source all the steps. Some of the topics I’ll cover on this talk are:

- Why Javascript is an appropriate introductory language to programming, versus popular teaching choices such as Python

- What is feasible in a short length workshop

- How programming workshops empower and inspire learners

- How this experience contributed to my own learning, as well as personal and professional growth

- The materials to reproduce this workshop

Hello. So, um, I'm Etiene Dalcol I'm a software engineering student from Brazil, I'm currently studying

00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:39,340
in France. And I also develop sailor, which is a LUA MVC framework. Some months

00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:46,250
ago I was invited to present add MLH at a conference women's international leadership

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:53,950
at Bremen, besides presenting MLH and inviting people to hack ton, I was supposed to five

00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,440
a two hour workshop on programming. There are a lot of things I would like to share

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,140
with you. Some of the topics I'll cover during the talk is why using JavaScript instead of

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,250
some other language, that is visible in such a short time, why inspiring people is important

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:20,509
and my personal growth from all of this. So let's begin with the choice of JavaScript,

00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:27,740
well, a language was not imposed on me, I was just told to give an introduction workshop,

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,240
so I was free to chose what I wanted. The story tis not again with JavaScript, it begins

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:42,530
with Lua, one week before the conference, I participate in the a Hacathon where I built

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:50,960
a card game using Lua and a game development framework called love 2 D, I was really improved

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,049
how fast and fun it was. You can see the look on my face, seem to be having a lot of fun.

00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:03,509
And I never did lots of game development, but it actually remained me of my first programming

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:10,590
experience. There was this on‑line became called Rag or rock on‑line, we could run

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,680
local servers, we could modify the game, I remember exactly the first day where I got

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,260
my own character working and I could click on it and it would do exactly what I thought

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:30,170
it should do. And it was magical, it was powerful? AAnd I thought if I could relate to that,

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:37,200
maybe some other people would. So I said, okay, I'll go with them through this game,

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,340
I had just made in Lua, but then there was some problems, well, not really problems but

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,849
things that could get improved. I started considering some other options. So, I had

00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:56,590
two hours and I really just wanted to cover some basics, variables, array, etc., and we

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,220
need to be really careful when picking a language to teach a beginner, sometimes it's as if

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,709
we forget the basic structure of a language. For example, I could go for a language just

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:15,410
because it has lots of libraries, lots of tools, loathes of tutorials, specific for

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:24,959
beginners, for example Python, but I remember my first Python, and I remember taking over

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,360
30 minutes to find out what was wrong with my code when it looked exactly like the tutorial

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,989
I was following. I it looked equal but it just didn't work. It was because, somewhere,

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:42,480
somewhere in the code there were four spaces where there was supposed to be a tab, and

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,099
I started having home sigh deal thoughts. So I said, um ... yeah, maybe, let's consider

00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:57,340
some other options. So what about JavaScript? I said, um ... maybe it's complex, right you

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,940
can do incredible stuff with script, I thought we don't need the whole thing, we just need

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,519
a subset of the language, and the subset is not scary at all to beginners, I said, okay,

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,239
JavaScript seems like a good choice. And another point was I wouldn't be giving the workshop

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,909
alone, well 150 is a lot of people, so the conference organizer, wound herbful team of

00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:24,870
volunteers, they walk around ‑‑ a wonderful team of volunteers, they walk around and assist

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:33,030
and everything. They said it would be better if we use a language that we all have in common.

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:42,870
Lua is great, but somewhat obscure, JavaScript was the language we all knew. And there's

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:51,310
also the question about the tools needed. So, setting up a development environment quickest

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:57,310
and nicest and most pleasant activities we take before we starting to programming something.

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,620
And while Lua and the love 2D framework is really super easy to get going, I'm saying

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,250
that from my perspective as a software engineering student, I'm dealing with an audience that

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:17,500
consists of non‑tech participants. So the thing to cowas to reduce the time to zero.

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,680
Everyone already has what it takes to code JavaScript on their compute computer, everybody

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:31,030
has a browser. Not even just a browser, someone on the team suggest wed use Mozilla Thimble,

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:41,900
we can see the code, use side by side (Mozilla) it's really easy to use. So, to sum up, about

00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,210
JavaScript has zero effort, it doesn't need additional libraries or frameworks to make

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:54,139
graphics, which makes everything very easy to remember in case they want to try it out

00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:01,389
later. And it's also pretty useful in a beginners context. mean, I'm sure the first program

00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:08,889
will not be a TCP/IP protocol. And I know they tonight want to know what Monads are.

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:16,960
So, JavaScript enables people to write games and web sites, which is exactly the same kind

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,569
of software they have direct contact with on a daily basis. So, okay, the plan said

00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:31,699
I was going to port my game from Lua to JavaScript and starting to plan the workshop. So let's

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:39,740
talk about the feasibility in two hours. This is a part, very detailed oriented, every tiny

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:46,169
thing we can do to save time counts, so I have some tips and tricks to share with you.

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:53,340
So, first, I recommend having everything ready. Even if you're teaching something very simple,

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,990
I wouldn't suggest impro vising. Not because you could make a mistake and make a fool of

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,300
yourself in front of everyone, if we're giving a workshop, chances are you know more than

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,410
the audience, so you really tonight have to worry about that but the thing is, if you

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,889
make a mistake you lose time, and if you has time, you take away from the audience the

00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:18,960
opportunity to learn something else that could have been learning during that time. So having

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:27,080
that in mind, Skeleton code is very useful. Whale it would be much more ‑‑ while

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:34,759
you could teach much more by developing everything from scratch, it is simply not feasible. So

00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,569
what I did exactly was that I prepared the whole game, then I removed some parts so I

00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:46,639
could have them fill and modify. For example, when I first explained what a variable is,

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,349
I would say, oh, hey hear's a variable called scale, it's being used to multiply the width

00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:58,470
and height of all um imagines in a game. If you nodfy it, you can see the whole game shrink

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:04,280
or enlarge, when I first talk about functions I could say, hey, let's make the function

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,120
that makes the duck move and so on. So every tiny bit of the game was something I wanted

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:17,199
to teach. Now this is something that looks really simple, but it's really useful compared

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:25,860
to the foreign text to get going. Having a short easy pronounceable URL can save a whole

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:32,260
five ten mens of the participants being clueless and asking each other what's going on, I really

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:44,640
suggest that if you have anything to download or any materials to share. Also, give them

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,760
time to write their code, but be prepared to say times up, give out the answer and move

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:56,040
on to the next topic. Because it's normal if the participants get stuck in some aspect,

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,050
but you don't have to stop the workshop there and wait until everyone's done, because some

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,100
students they might not come up with a good answer by themselves, but they will understand

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:12,300
once you explain it. also suggest not moving to the next topic without first giving the

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,560
answer to the last one, because you might lose someone there, participants may get stuck

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,160
and trying to solve that little thing until the end of the workshop and get out of there

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,830
really frustrated. And believe me, you don't want people to get out of your workshop frustrated.

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:35,399
It can also happen that you don't have time to show them everything you planned. So, I

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,339
really recommend leaving the extra things for the end, so in my case, for example, I

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:47,130
was planning to teach them operators by making the wings of the duck flap, and some flux

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:54,810
control by hitting the duck and killing it. So, we need to think what is more important

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:01,500
in terms of programming and what makes more sense in the whole context. So in the case

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,209
of my workshop I wanted the participants to have a complete and playable became by the

00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:13,209
end so that the ‑‑ should die. I moved the flapping to the end, because in the end

00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:19,350
we rain out of time and it did have to be cut off, so it was a good idea. And last thing,

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,459
before I move on to the next topic is typography. I'm giving special attention to this pause

00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:40,010
this is something I messed up. I was reaching between the ‑‑ switching between the slide and the code and

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:46,420
when I was explaining something using the slides, like I said, I was presenting HML,

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:52,370
and they have a branded style for using the style in the company, so I didn't give much

00:10:52,370 --> 00:11:00,670
thought to it. So, this is for example, it worked just fine. But when I said, hey, let's

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:06,040
make the function that makes the duck move, then it didn't work at all. Can you guess

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:18,459
why? It was horrible for them to know what exactly what paren that sis or brackets or

00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:26,620
could recallly on my crappy slide and it confused the hell out of them when I switched the code.

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,399
And the funny thing is that I did show the slides to friends two are programmers, to

00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:38,820
people on the team, to people from MLH, and nobody has a flag there, because this is obvious

00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:46,120
to us, we already know those are parenthesis When it's not obvious to us, then it's really

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,980
irritating (parenthesis) and I got particularly mad at myself because I'm often complaining

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:59,209
when professors do this, and then I went and did the very same thing, so, yeah ... I'll

00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:04,560
definitely take this as a lesson for the next time, typography is really important. Okay,

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:12,290
so, we got to the end, we're able to do the whole game during the workshop with moving

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:19,459
ducks that could be shot and killed. And to me this is hugh. This is a hugh progress for

00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:26,320
two hours, and we should be making this more often. But given that teaching a practical

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:35,910
skill alone is not enough. Inspiring is important. So I wanted to give them reasons to feel encouraged

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:41,320
so they could enjoy the technicality a bit more and also get curious once the workshop

00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:49,730
is over, so they can experiment with it later, maybe start programming more. But how? How

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:58,260
do they go from one stage to the other? Well, one way is to show them examples of things

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,680
they can build with technology. You can also show them people having fun with things they

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:12,639
can build. Well, a particular aspect of my workshop was that directed at young women

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,779
and I really wanted to show them that computer science and programming is indeed a place

00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:25,660
where women can be, which is something I am constantly not convinced myself, so, we all

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,420
in this universe can with be a little challenging to women. Please forgive my crappy drawing

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:39,110
abilities. That one is me, I'm really happy to see such a diverse conference here, more

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:46,800
often than not, I am the only woman in the room when I'm dealing with technology. And

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,570
I really wanted to show them that this is not the case, that this does not represent

00:13:52,570 --> 00:14:00,550
the reality as a whole. So, I really wanted to show them role models, because it can be

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:08,089
really de‑motivating when we see only images of successful males in our field. Because

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:14,310
if we don't see people like us doing these things, we believe we can do these things

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:20,920
as well ‑‑ we we believe we can't do these things as well. As I was searching pictures

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,860
and stories to show them, I ‑‑ that was the first time I felt it was really important,

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,630
we had been discussing this often in our community, and I'm really happy about it, but this is

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:42,510
when I felt it for real because when I was looking for the source the show ‑‑ itches

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:54,190
really excited to show these womens to other women, I am teaching programming and I'm not

00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:02,050
going anywhere. This was a moment that I absolutely needed to go through this list of amazing

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:22,800
women. And I'm not sure and I'm not sure when I'll ever stop needing that. So and I hope that this was as important

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:30,699
to the audience as it was for me. I hope some of them were positively surprised to hear

00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:36,459
some of those names for the first time, just like I was when I first heard over them as

00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:45,209
well. When I saw the room filled with women programming, so excited about the ducks moving

00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:52,600
for the first time, I did learn something else. I mean lack at her, she's actually enjoying

00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:01,889
it. And, I can't really express in words how it was by the end of the workshop. There was

00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:11,180
this woman that came to me and said, computers hate me. Everything I touch crashes. I'm just

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:17,980
horrible with computers. But she managed to get everything working and she was so happy,

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:25,019
and she was asking me for materials. So I just gave her like code academy, and it was

00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:35,430
amazing, other people were asking how to modify the game into doing this or that. And it got

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:43,540
me like this ear to ear smile that I just can't get off my face. And I learned that

00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:51,779
teaching is so rewarding, this is the moment I said, I must do this for life. This is amazing.

00:16:51,779 --> 00:17:01,889
So if you forget like everything I've been saying in this talk, please remember this:

00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:10,669
Teach people. If you have any time to spare, reserve some time to teach people. Especially

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:16,240
if it relates to something you care about. Because it gathers this feeling we can do

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:25,589
this, we can totally do this. In two hours we can do amazing things. And while people

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:36,480
are coming to thank me for the workshop I was thanking them. So, ‑‑ I was thanking

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:45,600
them, it was such an amazing feeling that I want everyone else to feel the same thing.

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:54,330
I'm very happy to share all the materials of my talk, of my workshop. If you go on my

00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:00,360
GitHub Repository you'll find everything. You'll find the full code, you'll find the

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:07,370
Skeleton code, you'll find the slides. I have made a different version of the slides with

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:15,010
different typography. And so you can download everything. I also have the old version for

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:24,049
people that work with MLH by any chance. So, I'm finishing this really early. And I'm really

00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:30,730
bad. This is the end of my talk, if you have any questions, I'll be around, you can also

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,700
