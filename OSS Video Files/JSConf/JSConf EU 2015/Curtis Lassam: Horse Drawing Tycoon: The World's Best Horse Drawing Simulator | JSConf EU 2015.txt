Title: Curtis Lassam: Horse Drawing Tycoon: The World's Best Horse Drawing Simulator | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-22
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	After a local VanJS meetup, my friends and I were tossing around project ideas. Someone referenced a website that would procedurally generate terrible ideas for video games. “A tycoon game where you draw horses indefinitely”.

What a wonderful, terrible, awful idea for a game.

In this presentation, we go through the 1000 lines of Javascript and two weeks of drunken after-work coding required to produce the world’s only horse drawing tycoon simulator, with Canvas, Twitter integration, the legendary HorseHash™ algorithm, HorseCurrency™, and HorseStamps®!

You’ll pay for the whole seat but you’ll only need the edge.
