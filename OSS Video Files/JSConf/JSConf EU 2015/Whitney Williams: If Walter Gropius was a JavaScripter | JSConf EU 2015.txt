Title: Whitney Williams: If Walter Gropius was a JavaScripter | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-21
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	The Bauhaus school’s emphasis on the importance of simplicity, the belief that form follows function, and the reconciliation of the fine and applied arts mirrors the development community’s struggles to reconcile code with design. We’ll examine how the ideas of Walter Gropius and other leading minds at the Bauhaus remain relevant nearly a century later, and focus on how these fundamental tenets can guide the way we structure our JavaScript.

I am super excited to be following another history talk it's really relevant to hear

00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,210
where we came from so we know where we're going. Like Lindsay said my name is Whitney

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,640
I am a front-end developer from Greenville South Carolina. Two of my favourite things

00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:48,440
are JavaScript and Germany, speaking on stage here is like the best thing ever. {applause}

00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,170
If you have any questions, you can tweet at me on Twitter I am also in German if you have

00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:01,129
questions you can ask me in the hallway or on Twitter in German. Fortunately this talk

00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:13,280
is in English. So, this talk is about ideas and not aesthetics. For many people it was

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,200
associated with a particular style and has a particular look. While it's true the Bauhaus

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,060
left behind a distinct visual legacy the school and its makers left behind something that’s

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,659
way more important than the visual style. That's a way of thinking. So for this talk

00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:34,680
we'll focus a lot more on the visual or a lot less on the visual, a lot more on the

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,590
methodology and the reason behind it. In other words we're going to focus a lot more on the

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:46,140
what, and a lot more on the why less on the what. So because the visual legacy is also

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,119
important I have tried to include a lot of that stuff the pictures in my talk, but hopefully

00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,850
you will get a picture of the idea that it's more than just this sort of look.

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,009
So the industrialisation of the 19th century end of World War I and the dissolution of

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,159
the German monarchy brought about social political changes without with the Bauhaus would have

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,430
been pretty much inconceivable. It came about at a time when everything was changing, and

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,890
Germany was really undergoing a revolution not just in design but in the entire country.

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,690
It's something I think is really, really interesting.

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:27,500
At this time factories for the first time were really starting to mass distribute stuff

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,310
inexpensively in the mid-1880s but most of the stuff that was designed and produced was

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,079
of incredibly awful quality. It was that sort of throwaway produce where it was good for

00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:43,060
a little while then all of a sudden once it broke there was no fixing it, you threw it

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:50,239
out. Arts & Craft movement came along said we want to switch and make something that’s

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,470
beautiful, amazing, something the complete opposite of mass produced. So in the 1860s

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,660
they started to try to reconcile decoration with design so this idea that stuff had a

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:09,139
lot of detail, and a lot of really beautiful surface sort of stuff on top of it. This was

00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:16,729
something that factory made goods beforehand just plain old didn't have, and could not

00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,410
reproduce.

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:26,930
So the Bauhaus was formed from a merger of Saxony's Kunstschule and the Kunstgewerbeschule.

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,940
I say those in German there are no words for them in English. It basically means arts school,

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:40,269
the technical title was Staatliches Bauhaus Weimar, they sought to work within the limitation

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:45,699
of less expensive materials and really produce something that was of really, really nice

00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:49,919
quality and it was also well designed so they hoped to bring these two ideas together and

00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,530
say we can make something that is beautiful and it's functional but it's also affordable

00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,229
to the everyday person.

00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:01,299
The other thing that Gropius really tried to do was that he tried to build and shape

00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:06,519
a new kind of designer in a human being, he thought could change the world really.

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,320
A big question I am going to ask today is how did the Bauhaus ideas and approaches stand

00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:20,000
the test of time, how are they still relevant today, almost 80 years later. So this school’s

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,110
founder Walter Gropius like I said he hoped to create this new designer, this new human

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,389
being that could change the world. Less than four years after its founding his school was

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:37,120
internationally known and had become a meeting place for the European avant-garde in an industry

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,449
that’s changing and seeking the next big thing. I want to look at how almost hundred

00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:49,520
years later the Bauhaus in this style and idea of how we design and how we write our

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,479
JavaScript, has sort of experience of resurgence in popularity. So to shape the new designer

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,669
envisioned by Walter Gropius, education at the Bauhaus was not just limited to academic

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:08,259
knowledge but they really encouraged experimentation, collaborative learning in the idea of friendly

00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:12,270
interaction between the masters an students, so you had a lot of good stuff like Bauhaus

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,419
parties that were legendary. They had the white party, the yellow party, the red party

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:24,080
and I went and visited Bauhaus and you see the architecture if you see the sort of atmosphere

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,139
that they believed it's incredible how everything that came into not just a school and learning

00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:35,520
and ok sitting in a classroom but really a lifestyle. It was incredibly interesting how

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,080
they did it, and did it very differently.

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,979
Unfortunately, I think a hundred years later our industry has lost its way, unlike the

00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:51,889
Bauhaus where they try to create this collaborative movement and lifestyle, we have really gone

00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,289
off the rails and far from cultivating friendly interaction we really are struggling as a

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:01,379
community to build a welcoming, cohesive community. Instead a lot of the time we're building up

00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,409
barriers that are not just senseless but they stand in the way of real progress. We tend

00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:09,979
to sort of surround ourselves with people who think like us, they look like us, they

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:15,469
talk like us, we end up seeking out inspiration within our tiny circle - that's a huge mistake.

00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:23,680
One of the most, I guess important for me, personal sort of struggles in the JavaScript

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,759
community is this which is the ridiculous split between designers and developers. It's

00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:36,770
really, really harmful, thinking we can do stuff together so rather than collaborate

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:45,189
{applause} so rather than collaborating to achieve common goals, designers and developers

00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:50,379
I think a lot of times really feel like hey we're on competing teams, we're fighting against

00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,870
each other and we can't come together and say hey, you know what at end of the day all

00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:01,370
we want to do is ship a product, and that goes together, we're all in this together.

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,699
This uneasiness, it stands in the way of successful

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:09,840
collaboration. In reality the principles of good design often mirror those of good development.

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,539
So while it can be said that the school and its masters issued this harmonious atmosphere

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:24,599
that Gropius set forth in his Bauhaus manifesto back in 1919, instead the Bauhaus was incredibly

00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:31,680
progressive for its time and Gropius believed that through the process of modernisation

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,240
he could master that via design and that the arts and crafts would form the foundation

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,050
of all activity, and so he really wanted to bring everything together sort of under one

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,479
umbrella. Unlike the European arts schools of the time he actually - which typically

00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,949
taught art and design as 2 totally separate subjects never together the Bauhaus decided

00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,939
to bring those 2 together and reverse the split between art and production which up

00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:02,419
until that point really had not been done, it was either you were a fine artist or a

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:07,259
designer, and never both that's something that's really, really interesting the idea

00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:16,409
that hey we do have roots in fine arts and craft it's something that’s very important.

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:21,849
So the struggle to reconcile the fine arts that was happening back then in the early

00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:26,979
20th century that really for me mirrors our development community struggle to reconcile

00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:32,729
code with design. A lot of times we sort of we blame the complexity of modern websites

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:39,610
or apps, we say we really need an increasing amount of specialisation from today's designers

00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:45,860
and developers and we forget that even back then, there was this huge challenge of physical

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:53,210
architecture and building and similarly we still face the same kinds of challenges. It's

00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,400
still difficult.

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,160
I think that the way that we fix this, is to move away from tiny circles, we move away

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,640
from picking sides, we move away and we shape and create a community that we can be proud

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,350
of and that's going to be a community where developers and designers they really work

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:17,320
with each other, instead of against each other. I think that is the first step for me.

00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:24,890
So in the Bauhaus in order to prepare students that introduced a foundation called Liberate

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,030
the People individually from the dead weight of convention, he really wanted to get away

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:37,180
from all the Old Masters stuff and so the course, the foundation course the The Vorkurs

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:44,920
was originally taught by Johannes Itten, it uses eccentric Swiss painter guy his aim was

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,770
to form the creative individual so for the first time instead of looking at the Old Masters

00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:55,030
works then just copying them it was like hey ok let's look at these works and tell a sort

00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:01,040
of what is happening here, let's learn form, let's learn colour, composition, let's learn

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,890
all of these things that the masters are teaching us but instead of copying that work let's

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,810
just go ahead an say I am going to take my inspiration from this but I am going to make

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:17,690
something myself. So I am going to learn by creating and not by copying.

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:27,410
So, by 1923 Gropius had started to shift his ideas a little bit. Itten, said he was a bit

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,780
of a weird guy, his increasing focus on individual artistic expression as well as his involvement

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:42,950
in this religious group/cult called the Mazdaznan religious group, started to irritate Gropius,

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,700
went a little bit off the

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:51,000
rails. Gropius desired a more intense collaboration with technology, he really wanted to make

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,870
that the focus, and so it was dismissed and instead they transferred the leadership of

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:06,710
the Vorkurs to 2 new people, Josef Albers and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, integration of designed

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:13,070
technology and industrial production, this course in the The Vorkurs become one of the

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:21,440
Bauhaus most defining pedagogical features, it still exists in many design schools today,

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,220
it's something that really changed the way we think about design the way that we teach

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:32,570
design and it's still incredibly relevant. The other thing that they came up with was

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,780
this idea that form follows function, the quote itself ‘form follows function’ was

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,650
actually from an American it's not from the Bauhaus, which is why I didn't put it in the

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:47,380
slides, but yeah, so this idea that everything has a purpose.

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:54,960
So after this increasing political and economic pressure from the conservative parties forced

00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,940
the Bauhaus out of Weimer, they needed to find a new location. So in 1925 the school

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,970
relocated to Dessau, they have an incredible museum I would really recommend you all go

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:11,060
to if you are all interested. The one here in Berlin is unfortunately a) not friendly

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:20,190
and b) not interesting. {laughter}, so it's here in Dessau that Gropius founded the new

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:27,700
building so he also built houses for the Bauhaus teachers essentially to live in, these are

00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:35,990
called Meisterhauser. They all interact with these building significant interest from inside

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:43,370
Germany itself but also from abroad. As industrial output grows the German population become

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:52,600
a lot more urbanised, they starting living more cities. They focused on industrial mass

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,810
production and technology, for him technology was incredibly important, he had an almost

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:05,660
singular focus on this. A lot of the time contemporaries are like we really think this

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:12,050
is a mistake, looking back in retrospective is this stubborn quality that made the Bauhaus

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:19,720
this revolutionary, this embracing of technology, this embracing of change saying we know this

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,910
is different we don't care, we're going to do it anyway, we think it’s the right thing

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,490
to do.

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,970
Similarly the modern web is evolving at a super, super incredibly fast rate. We either

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,060
face this challenge of we're going to adapt or we're going to be left behind

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,810
Listening to a lot of the other talks, that talk about yes, 2015, it's pretty obvious

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:47,070
if you don't talk about this stuff now you don't have a career as a JavaScripter, two

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,440
years from now, certainly not ten years from now, that's something we really need to take

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,790
into consideration.

00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:59,970
So JavaScript developers are seeking to push the boundaries of the web, developing new

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:06,910
experiences that weren't possible a few years ago, not even popular or possible a couple

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:13,720
of months back we complain a lot about oh my God we really have to learn the new frameworks,

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,790
learn to build the new features and tools, we have to look at applications, there is

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:26,420
so much stuff to get through and we complain a lot. Whoops...

00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:32,010
One thing I think that we kind of forget is that being revolutionary means taking risks,

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:38,160
it means challenging ourselves and saying, hey, we are ready for this. It's easy to forget

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,540
that the challenges we face today are not

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:46,160
linked to us and our culture and our time, they're actually - they are very different

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,480
to the challenges that Gropius faced, but at the same time they are also incredibly

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,660
similar, we are facing the pressure to go forward, to reinvent ourselves to keep making,

00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:04,630
to keep doing, to always sort of churning out new work, it's exhausting, it was exhausting

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:11,010
back then and it's exhausting now, but it's something that we just can't get around.

00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:18,180
So, the real question then is how do we sort of avoid burn out, what can we do that's meaningful

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,810
and worthwhile? These are problems that are really hard to solve, because for everyone

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,400
it's incredibly different, there is no one solution that we can fix for everybody, but

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,570
what we need to remember is that progress and not perfection is our goal. You just need

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:41,050
to, we need to try it, we need to keep moving forward. It's not an end game thing. There

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,140
is always going to be something new to learn.

00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:50,290
So, Gropius actually, he really failed to realise the idealistic dreams that he had

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,610
in his opening manifesto, but his influence is still really incredibly strong today, almost

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:02,290
100 years later and the way of thinking that he left behind is enormously influential not

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:08,650
just in the fields of education and architecture but also in design and development.

00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:17,550
So, umm... like I said, there were three leaders of the Bauhaus, each of the Bauhaus directors

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:23,740
worked to change and change the world of design in its section in the world in its own way,

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,230
Gropius seeked to close the gap between the artist and the citizen to bring art to every

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:37,920
burn he wanted to make well designed products available to the masses. The was Hannes Meyer,

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,530
you won't find out about him in the history books, it's starting to change more, he was

00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:49,660
politically unsavoury at the time, eventually thrown out, interesting his time as Director

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:56,000
of the Bauhaus he tried to bring to the forefront the social aspect of designs and provide goods

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,010
for the people rather than the luxury. The final Director of the Bauhaus, refers to a

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:12,780
lot of what Meyer said, he was politically not savoury at the time, umm... so Ludwig

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,470
Mies van der Rohe, so he reversed a lot of the decisions and refocused the school back

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:27,339
to architecture, in particular the connection between building technology and aesthetics,

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,570
the students stood that forefront of the industry and they believed they could use technology

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:38,360
to make the world better. For them the idea of acceptability enjoyed a much broader context,

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:47,120
back then it meant just something was accessible period, available period. Now we sort of have

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,240
this period of acceptability being with a screen or being with a particular device,

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,309
that's true now in the modern context, but really at its core we assume that people have

00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:05,149
these devices and these screens, but at the same time it's really, really important that

00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:10,700
we remember that we're not supporting devices, we're not supporting screens, we're not supporting

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,080
things, we are supporting people. I think that's, that's very different from this idea

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,700
of - I'm going to do something that works on every product, what you really want to

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:27,350
do is build something that is accessible by every individual person.

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,999
So, for Gropius leading the Bauhaus was an incredibly exhausting and he leaned a lot

00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:39,480
on the Masters of form, the teachers at the Bauhaus, initially this sort of struggle of

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,620
keeping the Bauhaus alive especially in

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:47,289
Germany at a time when things were falling apart all over the place, was incredibly just

00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:55,190
awful and it brought them together, originally, but conflict sort of, it... it builds on itself,

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:01,070
it gets worse. Unfortunately the sort of collaborative spirit that Gropius tried to build in the

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:08,210
beginning started to fall apart, so it was exacerbated by the constant shift on teachers,

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:13,409
the politically scene was very radical in Germany and also very owe pre-sieve, it led

00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:21,110
to an erosion of passion and collaborativeness, people stopped wanting to work together, instead

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:28,490
things fell apart around Gropius and eventually he left. During his time leading the Bauhaus,

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:35,539
he wanted to create this, you know, hey we're all in this together. It was probably really

00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:43,669
influenced by his time in the organisation called the Deutsche Werkbund, for the rest

00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:49,909
of his career, looking back at the Bauhaus, thing, "Wow, I tried hard", things really

00:19:49,909 --> 00:20:00,720
fell apart, he started to value the I'd of partnership over individual so he said this

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,019
was something that really affected him for the rest of his career.

00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:10,129
So, almost 90 years since the closing of the Bauhaus we are still confronting the same

00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:15,999
exhaustion, the same idea of, we're not as enthusiastic sometimes as we used to be when

00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,679
we are building things. Like the Masters, we struggle to balance our desire for praise,

00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:27,320
the idea that we personally built the whole thing, that we personally tried some new technology,

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,679
we struggle to work together to accomplish something as a team, this frenetic pace of

00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,529
JavaScript development today makes the situation worse, we have to master new technology and

00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:44,320
support an ever expanding array of devices, a lot of times it's just exhausting, we feel

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:51,269
overwhelmed, exhausted sometimes both, sometimes we are faced with the decision to become specialists

00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:58,610
or generalists, we can't possibly learn everything, it's really frustrating. So I think what we

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:03,799
should do is look back at what Gropius did and say, hey, what we really need to do is

00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:10,960
establish a set of guiding principles that will guide our community. When we look back

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,360
and we look at what Gropius achieved, you know, he really didn't achieve his initial

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,639
vision what he set out to do, what he set out to do isn't in the history books. Even

00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:25,429
after the Bauhaus closed the students and teachers emigrated all around the world and

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:27,409
took the ideas with them.

00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:34,809
So where does it leave us, what does this walk through history show us? Gropius developed

00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:40,539
this new technology of mass produce with beauty and functionality, he said the final goals

00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:48,350
of artistic activity is architecture, what I want to say is that for him buildings, they

00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:53,999
represented the coming together of knowledge, inspiration and he referred to this by a German

00:21:53,999 --> 00:22:03,419
word Gesamtkunstwerk, so, what I think is really cool, is to think that the web is Gesamtkunstwerk,

00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:08,289
it's this coming together of all of the things, it's our product, it's are culture, it's our

00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:14,860
industry. We're not likely to leave behind physical sort of remnant, the architecture

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:20,679
of the buildings like the Bauhaus was, but 80 years from now, 100 years from now, when

00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:28,049
they look at us and they say, "What did the JavaScript developers of 2015 leave behind?"

00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:34,749
It's actually our culture, the way we build things, the way we work with people and not

00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:40,019
the actual things that we leave behind, I want our legacy to be something we are truly

00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:44,090
proud of.

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,129
