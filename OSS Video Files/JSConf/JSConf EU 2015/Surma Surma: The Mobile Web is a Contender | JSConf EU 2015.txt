Title: Surma Surma: The Mobile Web is a Contender | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-20
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	This talk will focus on the new generation of APIs which make the web a more capable platform for applications. Push Notifications, Offline Storage with Service Workers, and responsive UIs built in Web Components. These are the building blocks of the future. We will also look at the kinds of sites which excel as mobile web apps (backed with actual data!), and make the case for why you should be investing more in your mobile web experience.
