Title: Brenna O'Brien: JavaScript Community: The Good Parts | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-09
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	As front-end dev educator, my heart broke every time a student proclaimed “I hate JavaScript.”

I’ve found the JavaScript community to be extremely positive and welcoming, but we can do better, especially if our newest colleagues aren’t feeling the love. Let’s talk about barriers to entry for new JS devs, both technical and non-technical, and let’s talk about how we can help alleviate them. Learn how to be supportive and inspiring in your daily work, how to teach and explain JS concepts effectively, and how you, esteemed JS community member, can help end the laments of “I hate JavaScript.”

Hello, everyone, so my name is Brenna, I'm from Toronto in Canada and I'm a front-end engineer

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,360
at tent. But before that I actually taught at a Front‑End development boot camp for

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,670
a year. I want to tell you a little story about something that happened there that came

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,830
to be known as the "oprah circle" so the very first time we ran this boot camp everything

00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:57,850
was sort of experiment, we were feeling it out as we went along and we kind of followed

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,110
the normal course you would started out with a couple weeks over HTML and CSS followed

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,390
by a few weeks of JavaScript and then something happened in the weeks immediately following

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,830
JavaScript, there was a weird tension hanging over the entire classroom. We got this feeling

00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,500
that we had like defeated people. And so we decided that we needed to do something, we

00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,430
staged an intervention of sorts. We gathered all of our 27 or so students in a circle,

00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,179
and we asked them all to share a highlight of the course so far, followed by a low light

00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:36,830
and then another highlight. So the low lights ranged from things you would expect like:

00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:42,229
I don't get to see my friends and family as much, I have a long commute. Halve of my students

00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:49,759
gave me a one word answer "javaScript" JavaScript was a low light for them, this broke my heart

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,950
the JavaScript community is personally where I have felt like the most inspired, the most

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,009
supported, the most welcome in my own journey as a Front‑End developers and I wanted to

00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,619
know why aren't these people new to the is industry feeling the love, why haven't they

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,679
seen the good parts of the community. If you think about it, this isn't that surprising,

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,220
learning to code is a hard challenging thing to do, there are barriers involved. Today

00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,900
I want to talk about those barriers, some of them are technical, some of them are cultural,

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,190
and I want to talk about the solutions to help overcome them for the newest members

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:32,080
of our community. One thing that I think is really critical to remember is that many newcomers

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,159
to JavaScript are new to the world of programming in a lot of ways. This happens really frequently

00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,040
and increasingly because the demand for JavaScript developers is so high and we have a hugh influx

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,480
of people that are coming in from non‑traditional backgrounds and looking maybe formal computer

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,180
science training. I think many of us sort of build up our JavaScript knowledge like

00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,430
this. We're able to get the job done and like ship something out, but in essence we're looking

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,769
a solid foundation beneath that. One great strategy for dealing with this is just to

00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,969
read a book that covers these fundamental topics, there are a ton of them available

00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:15,730
on‑line for free. So whether this be for yourself our to recommend to somebody who's

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,140
kind of struggling building those foundations this is a good resource, eloquent JavaScript

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,530
in particular, a lot of people said they've had good success with that. And when you're

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,450
looking these foundations it fundamentally comes down to communication problem. How often

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,180
do we tell people oh, you have a problem in your code? Just Google it. And while it's

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,019
true that most of the answers are out there somewhere in the internet, how can somebody

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:47,719
formulate an intelligent question and find their way there if they don't use the correct

00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:53,969
terminology, if they don't speak the language. So, this I found was happening with a lot

00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,810
of my students, we just weren't seeing eye to eye as far as talking about the concepts

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:06,010
that we were trying to debug, I used a little technique I call hooked on syntax. So, something

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:12,469
like this, pretty simple line of code. Maybe if you are, you know, reasonably profish innocent

00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:16,209
JavaScript, you can read that and sort of parse out what it does immediately in your

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:22,990
head. But for a beginner, you have to interpret all this. That's a lot that you're doing implicitly.

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,930
I literally would sit with students and say let's sound this out word by word. Var, what

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,260
is that, that's a key word that exists in JavaScript and it says hey, I'm going to go

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,340
create a variable. Max number, what is that? And you know, I know that that's something

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,520
that I made up, I got to name that, but that's not something that's always clear to a beginner,

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,120
so you really have to be patient with people as they're going through things like this.

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,720
And this is actually like a tough thing for me to do as a teacher, like I struggle to

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,650
be patient. It's so tempting when the someone has a problem, hear's the answer I'll give

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,650
it to you, but they're never going to learn like that. One thing that infuriates me the

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,900
most when I see a more experience developer (infuriates) come over to someone's computer

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,729
and literally take over and type on it. You need to let that person, as painstaking as

00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,919
it might be, type things out really slowly for themselves and actually learn and internalize

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:29,360
and make their own mistakes. And returning to this idea of keeping track of a lot of

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,900
language and syntax and terminology, we really need to remember that this is not a test.

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,800
We're brought up with this culture of memorization, all throughout like most of our traditional

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,990
schooling, we learn something and then we're tested on it and usually we just have to memorize

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,800
the thing that we're being tested on this is not in any way like a typical programmers

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,889
work flow. Personally, I have the syntax for something like a four memorized because I've

00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:04,660
written it thousands of times, but I never Satoshi there with flash cards and memorized

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,759
for a 404 loop is, for some reason people that are entering don't get that, they feel

00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,580
a pressure that they have to memorize it. I want you to tell people it's okay to look

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,490
it up. There's no shame in looking something up that you don't know (Memorize it) let's

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,990
provide them with resources to do this. This is just like a quick cheat sheet I through

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,229
together for some of my students. I could tell that they were just overwhelmed with

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:36,800
all of this and it really helped to have that security blanket there, so share these resources

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:46,060
with people or create them yourself. Another challenge for a lot of beginners is specially,

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,520
especially for people coming in from HTML and CSS, that has a lot of immediate feedback

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:59,229
and visual output. So JavaScript can be really dry and abstract and boring. One thing, I

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:03,550
think we need to to do is stop using Foo and bar, extremely achieving tract things in our

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:11,520
example, use something with context that actually means something to someone. You know, if I

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,220
see black and Orange, I understand that those are both colors and they're related and helps

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,270
me grasp the con sect that an array is a collection of related items. The thing with this too

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:32,370
is it's also memorable. So, who recognizes this? It's a closing brace. Closing parenthesis

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,550
and a semi colon. It's a familiar pattern that we see at the end of a lot of call back

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:44,039
functions and if you're experienced you recognize this. To a beginner you miss one piece of

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:51,259
punctuation and everything stops. And you see syntax error on‑line 24, and which one

00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:59,349
of these is missing. Who knows. How do you get someone to build the memory for that signature,

00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:04,530
recognize this and know that this is the correct way to to it. You give it a silly nickname.

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,169
If you ask any one of the hundred or so people that taught JavaScript to last year, they

00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:21,500
will all immediately tell you this is the frownny winky neck beard. (Laughing) (Frownywinkyneckbeard)

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:30,949
similarly, dollar signs parens came to be know Q query activate! Because when you have

00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:35,010
something and you want to be able to use J query methods on it, you need to activate

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:41,630
the J query by swadelling it in dollar signs and parens. The moral is to have fun with

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,310
it. I think you're an incredibly fun bunch of people when I meet you in person, why not

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:52,120
bring that liveliness in our on‑line examples and make ourselves more memorable to beginners

00:08:52,120 --> 00:09:01,690
(Liveliness) so, time for another problem. If you've got your fundamentals down you know

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,920
the mechanics of how things work. A ton of people really struggle with tackling a larger

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,340
problem. They say where do I start? It's sort of libelerring to use a saw and a hammer and

00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,590
a tape measure individually. And then all of a sudden someone says build me a bookcase.

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:24,030
Where do I start with that? And I think this is actually where a lot of online tutorials

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,750
miss the mark they teach you the mechanics, they don't teach you the art of problem solving.

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,480
That's a skill, once you're an experienced developer you gain. So, I think we need to

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,770
teach people to think like a computer. Try and get them to break town a complex problem

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,510
into dis ‑‑ break down a complex problem into discreet steps you want to get them writing

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:51,080
pseudo code. You're giving them little baby portions to chew off one piece at a time that

00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,880
they can match up with their Toolkit a little easier. And I think we can do stuff in our

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,020
community to facilitate that and give people an environment where they can take on those

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,900
bigger problems and have support through working through the stages. This is a picture from

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,790
note school Toronto T school is a ‑‑ note school is a fantastic organization in

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:17,880
tons over cities easy to start a chapter if there isn't one where you live. Anyone is

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,120
welcome to come and work through a tutorial or hack on their own projects and it's completely

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,090
casual and informal but there's support there. There's experienced developers, there's peers

00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,810
to help them through that and sort of learn, you know, that more difficult art of actually

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,750
working through real world problems that you're solving with JavaScript. What this comes down

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,820
to in essence even though a lot of these are more technical strategies, is this is about

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,070
being welcoming to newcomers, just really taking them under your wing and helping them

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,440
get oriented in what is kind of a strange new world if you've never seen JavaScript

00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,670
before. So, let's assume our foundation is built, we know how to use all our tools and

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:12,230
when to use them. You're eventually going to come up against this. it's so great that

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,580
a lot of us have passion about JavaScript and how to write it, but with all these strong

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:22,410
opinions flying around this is what it feels like. People get totally concerned about what's

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:28,250
the right way to do it? I've seen it so bad 20 the point (People get totally) people are

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:34,840
scared to write town any code because they're afraid to do it the wrong way. Now part of

00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:42,870
this is JavaScript itself. Our lovely little language has so many instances where there

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,650
are literally multiple ways to accomplish the same task. This happens on a macro scale

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:53,830
as well. I think it's incredibly healthy that we have a rich ecosystem of frameworks and

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,820
tooling this can get extremely overwhelming when you're faced with all the choices and

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:06,270
you're not sure which one you should be using. Beyond this it's really not helpful when we're

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:17,520
constanthly critiquing penal for using last year's model. We need to let go the idea of

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,130
there being one true way to do something. Encourage beginners to pick a method, pick

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:28,920
a framework and give it a try. If you don't like it or if it doesn't work for you, then

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,300
try something new. You know. If it gets the job done, in my opinion, that's the right

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,860
choice. Let people learn for themselves what the maybe the pitfalls of using something

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:48,990
is on their own let them learn their lessons, we think we have done a good job with this

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:54,100
paradox of choice is through things like code style guides and best practices, people are

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,930
really looking for guidance here. I heard this answer over and over and over again that

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:05,200
I just don't know which thing to do. So, give them guidance. These are great tools to use

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,840
either if you're learning on your own, someone comes at you with an opinion, no, I did it

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:17,270
with this way because the AirBnB Java guide said so, shut that down. Also if you're leading

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:22,070
a team where you're managing a bunch of junior developers, implement something like this

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:27,020
so you can stop people arguing on your team and get people to writing JavaScript together

00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:35,910
as a team. If you're outside of these formal places where it's allowed to set the one true

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:43,940
way, we all need to bite our damn tongues. This probably happened to a lot of other people

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:51,650
in audience, you post a piece of code on‑line, all of a sudden, you have like opinions flying

00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:59,310
at you about oh, you should do it this way instead, have be you considered that in imstead,

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,450
why not say something like can I give you a suggestion instead of just flying at someone

00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:09,180
with the way that you think it's supposed to be done. If you start a conversation like

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,850
this, you're going to just like open up a dialogue where you can talk constructively

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:20,880
about maybe the benefits and draw backs of different options without it being so hostile.

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,870
And when you are giving help to someone, b writing a Blog post, GitHub issues stockover

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,290
flow answer, I think we need to chose our words really wisely. There's a great Blog

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,510
post by Chris Coyier about words to avoid in Eckcational writing. Educational writing

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:46,790
is anything Blog post stackover flow. If you use words like obviously, just, simply, you're

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:52,580
implying that the task is easy. But the audience are beginners, it's nota city for them, by

00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:58,060
using these words you've completely trivialize their struggle. And if you take the words

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:05,740
out of the sentence, it reads exactly the same way any way. Just don't do it. What this

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:13,300
is empathy really. You need to try and remember what it was like when you were learning, and

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,110
there's psychology there that the further you get from your beginner stage the more

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,010
expert you become it's actually just harder to remember what it was like when you were

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,500
a beginner, but I urge you all to just try before you answer someone who's in a more

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,910
junior position, take a second and try to see their perspective of where they're coming

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:39,630
from. This also applies with documentation. As a rather famous quote from Kathy Sierra,

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:47,750
if you want them to RTFM, make a better FM. I literally do not think I've ever heard someone

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:54,750
complain about documentation being too easy to understand so why not just make it accessible

00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:00,040
to everybody. I know it's not everybody's favorite task, but it is so, so critical there's

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,140
resources to help you write the docks that can help you with this. All of this is the

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,930
idea of being supportive instead of just critiquing. We quantity to be offering up resources and

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:20,280
encouragement. And so I also think we knead to just like to out of our way to be encouraging

00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:31,420
to other people. (Laughing) (Need) want to take that in a couple more times. You know,

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,140
I think in general humans are faster to offer up' negative opinion than a positive one.

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:41,080
We tend to hold that back. So just be encouraging whether that's in the form of like a high

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,580
five when someone's debugging something and they get it to work, celebrate the is small

00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,880
wins, tell somebody if you think they did something great. I'm sure they would love

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:56,300
to hear it. And sometimes that also means just giving somebody a gentle nudge. Pushing

00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:03,630
them outside of their comfort zone. There are so many people that have done this to

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,089
me when I thought, no, I can't talk at a conference, I don't have anything to say, I don't have

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,809
anything anyone wants to hear, I think Brian summed this up really well this morning. But,

00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:19,750
yeah, try and push people out of their comfort zone and encourage them to take leaps. Okay,

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:30,250
so, one more big thing I think I need to address. A lot of people feel like this. As they continue

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,009
in their journey they've learned a lot of foundations, they've maybe like been able

00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:39,830
to deal with the negative opinions coming in, but the more you see the industry, I think

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:46,389
for a lot of people they start to feel leek they don't quite fit in here. So, sometimes

00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:51,539
it's literally I don't look like you. I don't look like a developer, but even regardless

00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:57,279
of that, I think all of us have been fed this false narrative that in order to be successful

00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:05,419
as a developer, as a JavaScripter. You need to devote your entire life to code. You're

00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:09,330
not allowed to have outside hobbies, you'll never get ahead if you're not coding every

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:18,620
single night. I think this is entirely false. One of my students went through the boot camp,

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:26,789
I became friends with her, she got a job with a well known agency. On the books she was

00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:34,690
successful as a web developer. Personally she confided in me she was thinking of quitting.

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,269
She said I'd like to make something with my hands, I want to maybe just go into woodworking

00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:46,909
and do that instead. Instead. To her it was a binary option. She couldn't be a JavaScript

00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:53,629
developer and do something like this on the side. And I said, no, no, no, wait it's okay.

00:18:53,629 --> 00:19:01,149
I know developers who are carpenters. Anyone know will more key, he still does it ton side,

00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:06,009
he's done great talks about how that influences his JavaScript work. There are developers

00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:13,440
who are in to perfectly clear ice. (Laughing) and how do I know this? I know this because

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,950
they freely volunteer that information on Twitter publically (Laughing) but I think

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,830
that's great. I think ‑‑ we should all just not be shy about who we rein our lives

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:30,110
outside of JavaScript and share your lovely unique selves, because I fundamentally believe

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:45,090
teach and every one of you is totally awesome. Yeah. Clap for yourselves. (Applause) by having

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:51,110
unique interests, and knowledge from outside JavaScript or computer science we all bring

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,090
something incredibly unique to the table. And I think we're better off as an industry

00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:00,210
for it. Diverse people are going to look at things in different ways and solve diverse

00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:06,389
problems. And where I think the magic really happens is when we take our interests and

00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:11,970
hobbies and combine them with JavaScript to make truly inspiring things that appeal to

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:19,570
a much wider audience. General for example loves art, loves pixel art, so she does that

00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:27,200
on‑line, she makes a lot of art with JavaScript. I'm also incredibly inspired by our determination

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,870
to use JavaScript outside the browser. Node happened not to long ago we decided hey, we're

00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,919
stuck with JavaScript, I think it's sort of started where all of us were stuck with JavaScript

00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,919
because it's the only thing that runs in the browser and then this school thing happened

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,659
where we're like we're just going to put it elsewhere and run with it. So we got node

00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:53,700
with JavaScript on the server. And then we got Nodebots with JavaScript running on our

00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:00,509
Arduino boards and people like Sandra mesh always been into suing since a kid now she

00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:08,159
makes wearables that are controlled by JavaScript. And this idea of JavaScript all the things

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,730
just keeps growing and growing. I never imagined that I'd see JavaScript on a nitting machine,

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:26,350
but Mariko did this. Hopefully you all saw her talk reject JS. All of these people I

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,710
just showed you and so, so many others that I don't have time to mention have inspired

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:38,299
me to stick with JavaScript rather than any other language. They've inspired me to continue

00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:43,360
learning when I felt like I knew nothing to work on interesting side projects in my spare

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,149
time when I didn't have the motivation. That's why I'm standing here talking to you today.

00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:54,990
Me, and I think so many other people in this room just really finally felt I have a place

00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:03,480
where I belong. So to me, those are the good parts. We're welcoming in terms of helping

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,370
people build a solid foundation and building communities. We're supportive when we reserve

00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:16,970
judgement and offerer encouragement instead. And we're inspiring by just being cool awesome

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:23,100
people and making really interesting things with JavaScript all over. But not everybody

00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,789
knows this yet. Not everyone has had a chance to come to a conference like this and see

00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:34,159
the good parts. So my call, to all of you, is to take whatever you see as the good parts

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,260
