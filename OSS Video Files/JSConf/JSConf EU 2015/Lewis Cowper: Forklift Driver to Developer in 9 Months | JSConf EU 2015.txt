Title: Lewis Cowper: Forklift Driver to Developer in 9 Months | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-26
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	Moving up the ladder from forklift driver and general labourer, to front end developer, with a stint in manual testing, was a big challenge. However it’s exactly what I did, and I couldn’t have done it without following a few core principles.

Getting up the nerve to go to local usergroups, and conferences, and discovering a new found love of public speaking, was a huge leap from labouring. Similarly, I discovered contributing to open source wasn’t that big a deal, and some things certain projects did made it really easy! Also, learning about things like source control was super integral to being where I am today.

{Applause}. Cool. Can everybody hear me? Ok, cool I can hear me, awesome. So, just before

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,090
we gene I'm quite a connoisseur of the animated gif and just in an attempt to be inclusive

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:44,980
- you see that on the slide it means the next slide contains a gif, if you suffer from vestibular

00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,410
disorder or something that would make a uncomfortable, look away, listen to my voice, it's lovely,

00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,220
interesting and ethnic {Laughter}.

00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:01,530
I hope that makes you feel better and doesn't spoil your enjoyment, the next slide is animated,

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,229
this is how I feel after four days! {Laughter} .

00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:13,360
So I like to relax before doing a conference talk, so I like to make you move, after four

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,100
days of sitting down, yeah, probably going to help. So, hello I'm Lewis Cowper, both

00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,680
in life and pretty much everywhere on the internet and I just want to chill out for

00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,350
a bit. .

00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,100
So, you have heard a lot of fantastic talks and I hope you have had a chance to meet fantastic

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,500
people and chat to the sponsors and speakers after the talks, but I would really love you

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:45,700
to stand up for me. Feel free, have a little dance, little shake off. Everybody take a

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:53,469
deep breath and just hold, it nice and slow. Now on 3, I want you to blow there {toward

00:01:53,469 --> 00:02:00,170
the screen}. 1, 2, 3, go!! {Laughter}.

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:09,619
Wasn't that nice, just relax, it's ok, don't worry. So, yeah, forklifts and all that. Feel

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:10,520
free to sit down.

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,060
Have a glass of water and just enjoy at the moment.

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:25,620
So, forklift driver to developer in nine months. I'm@Lewis Cowper, pink sparkly heart JSConf,

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,870
please feel free to comment after.

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,600
Picture the scene, you wake up, it's still dark, you fall into clothes, you open the

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:43,630
door to leave and would you look at that, it snowed. Your job doesn't allow remote working,

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:49,170
your job doesn't require a WiFi connection and you are not sitting in front of a

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,920
computer, you make the best of it, put a fleece on, gulp down some tea, we're in Britain and

00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,250
that's how you warm. This is your work, recovered steel pipe most probably from the oil rig

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:14,510
or field, the ones on the left 5 inch, the big ones 9 and 5 eighths, in Britain we deal

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:22,100
with Americans, all the sizes make me feel uncomfortable, your biggest asset is probably

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:28,090
one of these, that bundle right there will weigh around 3 to 4 tonnes, if you try and

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,740
pick them up it doesn't work! {Laughter} .

00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:37,710
So, oh and if you drop that, I've discovered as well, steel pipe beats ground, so add that

00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:48,540
into the rock, paper, scissors thing, steel win!! And you can break things really easily.

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,940
So your job is to move these to your working area, where you are going to cut the pipe

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,930
with something like this. This is, I desperately tried to find a picture of my actual machine,

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:07,250
but my machine was in a small hut and was not nearly that clean and yeah, just generally

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:16,229
a bit grimy, we basically built a iron shed around that with two massive holes in the

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:24,650
side for the roller beds, so it your job is manual and really repetitive, it's varied,

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,130
sometimes something breaks and then you have to fix it.

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:35,729
{Laughter}. Some correlation. It gives your brain a lot of free time when you can just

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:41,460
switch off mentally at your job, I spent a lot of time analysing my work. So if one cut

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,840
takes x amount of time, how long would 1384 cuts take, no one bias an even amount, they

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:59,330
by buying distance, it's 1.88m, if I can get out 7 out of a 12, it's better to drag out

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:07,340
the longer pipe, soon enough my note bats looked like this, my colleagues, who were

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:14,540
less maths minded than me, thought I was Russell Crow in a beautiful mind! {Laughter} .

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:24,660
I love computers, I played with them for number of years, I like to think it was my analytical

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:33,280
mind that led me to programming or kept it fresh. I did the basics at school and tried

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:42,510
to go to university for computer science I was from a very small time, so I spent a lot

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:49,790
of time doing what we have been doing for the last few days, staying out late and partying,

00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,330
I signed up for an OU degree, computer science and design, soon as I got into second year

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,430
and introduced to Java, I didn't find it particularly engaging, I felt like I was learning in a

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,180
bubble and without an atmosphere of a classroom, I didn't seem to be able to focus and understand

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:14,560
why I had to type public stack void main every time and I still don't. I just wanted to make

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,970
a lot of things happen with my computer, not learn a lot of key words to get around. My

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,490
luck started to change, in the next city over, ten miles away, they were programming meet

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:30,990
ups, people got together in their spare time, unpaid, talked about programmering and taught

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:36,750
people stuff and asked questions, so combine people with enthusiasm for teaching and people

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:42,610
who want to learn, the fen diagram is basically the same, everybody wanted to teach and everybody

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,430
wanted to learn, it was fantastic.

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:52,860
It was going to be a crowd and you have to say the right thing at these meet ups, you

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,230
have to know the lingo, so I said public stack main void before I ordered a drink and everybody

00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:07,860
laughed, it kind of worked. I persevered and learnt the lingo, people there were happy

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,430
to chat about the things being discussed or anything related to DEV environment, when

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,400
you feel you have to say the right thing to fit in and at any time someone will find

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,139
out you don't know all the things, you start sticking to the one thing that gets you through

00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:35,510
these meet ups and I liked games, playing games, I liked the idea of making games. One

00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:40,520
of the groups was putting on a Gamejam in a month or so and I thought oh wow, I can

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:48,830
do some actually programming here, I looked at code on slides before at meet ups it was

00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,570
easy, definitely wrong, what they don't show in the code slides is the other 100 that make

00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:02,870
those work, I went to Google game tutorials to learning programming and discovered Python,

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:15,080
one caught my eye, rogue like library, the 5 hour tutorial took 17, I had functioning

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:21,180
game, it was really cool, it was the first time I made something from scratch.

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,990
When I went to the Gamejam, somebody asked if anybody wanted to do Python, I was like,

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:36,860
yes, this is fantastic, I don't need to go a rogue like on my own, I latched on to the

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,899
people doing Python and didn't let go.

00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,779
Then there was a team, a team of people who knew that I had literally never done anything

00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,180
until the weekend before and were able to skeleton out the game and let me play with

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:56,029
random variables and see, you know, how to implement proper looking gravity and stuff

00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:00,740
like that. Like I even, I was quite proud, I implemented a Para. lacks scrolling library

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,759
for a platformer when my team mates set we don't have time for that, 20 minutes later

00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,790
it was done, I was King of the world.

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:17,220
It was there that I met somebody who did Java as work, I said hey I'm learning Java, I should

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:24,029
ask them what it's like to be a junior developer, he came in at that same kind of place and

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:31,720
gone through they're process, on job adverts, looking for a junior developer, three years

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:39,970
experience programming in eight different languages is like, what!! Like, seriously!?

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:46,850
Catch 22, junior developer, three years' experience, either they not junior or they are not training

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,699
the people in three years the right thing and you should just not be doing that. So

00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:57,980
the company you work for hired developer via QA, you would spend a couple of years in the

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:05,740
QA department, moving from manually to automated testing, then in DEV team testing, essentially

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,610
when you get familiar enough with integration tests, you write unit tests and then code

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,779
to go with them, it seemed like a better job than forklift driving, air conditioned office,

00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:25,809
free water, what could go wrong! {Laughter} So I sent a CV away, heard nothing. Got in

00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:30,819
touch with my friend who said they couldn't find my CV, I thought ok I'll try again, tried

00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:37,410
again, I took a note that an error assisted, at the same time as there was an error processing

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:46,589
your application, congratulations CV submitted successfully, I thought that might be weird.

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,550
My friend got in touch after a few weeks and said they still didn’t have any record of

00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:56,879
it, I sent an email with screen shots to reproduce the bug that I'd found, as it turns out that

00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:07,490
was a pretty good higher for QA, it did that for a while but soon got very, very bored

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:14,660
to make sure the flow works on a different build, but I lived in the town where all the

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,009
meet ups were, so I was able to leave work and go to the meet up without rushing, Python,

00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:28,379
bit of Ruby, video games, but I really, really liked one of them, the JavaScript group, I

00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,569
loved how the language looked {Applause}.

00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:42,350
Great. There is an excuse. I loved how the language looked and I saw Ashley's talk describing

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,410
iteration through an array. If you look at Ruby when you already know what iteration

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,910
is, it looks really nice, when you look at JavaScript it actually explains what it's

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,019
doing, it's great. There's still like semicolon and I would reference a function it wouldn't

00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:00,179
call I wouldn't know why because it was there was no brackets on the end. So yeah.

00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:10,579
At the time I got into JavaScript round February last year having been programming for 2 or

00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:16,970
3 months at various meet ups every month or so I would do anew thing. So this was well

00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,079
into node being a thing, IE 11 had been out for a few months I’m like a clean slate

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,819
for somebody presenting JavaScript as if for the first time. They have played JavaScript

00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:30,790
image in the past they tell you what do you like in programming you say JavaScript they

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:39,300
go oh I am sorry. Come on you're programming you can open the DevTools and do this. JavaScript

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,920
was power, power over something that I just loved which was the web, you could take any

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,100
website and ruin it in the DevTools, break everything because you completely didn't understand

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,889
what was happening but you knew 4 functions if you applied them in the right way you could

00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:56,220
break everything, it was fantastic.

00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,999
It felt like you could just type vaguely what you wanted to happen and it worked. I mean

00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:04,739
I was doing simple stuff but it was amazing how quickly you can go from hey there's this

00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:11,100
thing from JavaScript to enough power, enough knowledge to be dangerous. I really liked

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,259
the Jennifer quote from the intro on Friday which is JavaScript is pseudocode with semi-colones

00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:25,399
on the end. I get that. It was just under 9 months or about 8 months that after I started

00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,059
doing manual testing that we had. I had gone to ScotlandJS seen some fantastic, started

00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:36,410
giving talks at user groups about things I didn't know anything about, but an opening

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:42,819
in the UX team who were working on their first AngularJS application having being doing Java

00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:49,350
rendered pages for end tyre company's laugh, I think I said JavaScript often enough in

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,420
the interview they were like yeah we'll take you on. I got the job.

00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,610
So there's a team of hackers we're all doing JavaScript it's all so fun. I get the title

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,769
of the talk I may have mislead you I didn't want to come here just to tell you my story,

00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:09,249
because now I am a developer that's where the story ends but I want to tell you about

00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:13,799
some of things that helped me along some, I learned myself some that others taught and

00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:19,189
definitely some that I wish somebody had said sooner. This talk is for you if you no anybody

00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:23,999
starting on the path to becoming a developer whether that's you useful, yourself, a colleague,

00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,009
somebody who's interested they don't know how to deal with that. Or even if you are

00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:33,360
watching this thing that's me I want to move into development I came here to learn and

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,879
be interested.

00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:42,009
Firstly, I would just say that this is not the right way to teach people modern web development.

00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:47,399
I realise you can't see, oh no it's actually contrast quite well you cannot read it, it’s

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,290
entirely deliberately it's the stack from ThoughtWorks training course the JavaScript

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,389
toolkit which is great for experienced developers who want to know what tools they have available

00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:05,110
across everything, but when you're new, you feel like all the things? I have to

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,970
learn all of that before I can write a website? This is useless. I think it's important we

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,610
should make learning materials at whatever level as accessible as you possibly can so

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,299
we can take people from this to this and be excited about learning the things they need

00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:25,749
to learn. Let's go through some of things you could and should know about what I value

00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:28,119
as a new developer.

00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:34,100
First one, honesty. It always nice. Because when you start out you break something you

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,439
hit an error, you feel like you're the only one that's having this problem and having

00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:44,079
it because you're stupid and you don't know anything. You can't figure out the right key

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,799
word to search for, you can't ask somebody because that would be terrible they will fire

00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:53,399
you because oh my God you have caused an error it's broken something on your computer. That's

00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,209
terrible. You feel like failures, what they don't realise it's that everybody programming

00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:02,549
all the time breaks everything we just get better at fixing it. Right?

00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:06,549
So when you have got a junior developer that's having a tough time with some new syntax or

00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:12,149
trying to go into ES6 or something, support them but try and let them come across the

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:19,619
answer themselves. If you write the code for them, you're just writing abracadabra, we

00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:29,389
have an app. It doesn't work no-one learns anything, people just as lost as me with things

00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:37,559
that I had come across helped a lot. It felt less like I was coding in a bubble, the thing

00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,949
I did know started becoming relevant.

00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:50,249
So if open source this next GIF perfectly encapsulate what I felt I will just look at

00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:56,299
that repository that looks like an interesting project. It turns out that there's a lot of

00:16:56,299 --> 00:17:00,799
open source software at there, not all of them are great learning experience but there's

00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,480
a lot to learn from the community surrounding some of them are amazing I want to take a

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,880
moment to highlight Hoodie that was my introduction last February my first commit an open source

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,980
project if you do know anybody who's does want to get involved in the community tar

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,010
some other awesome initiatives out there to help newcomers the Rails Girls project, very

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:29,139
recently they finished their Summer of Code where they crowdfunded a large basically trying

00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:35,899
to pay people who wanted to get into development and take them under the wing of an open source

00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:39,600
project, who was happy to mentor them and answer any questions. It's fantastic. Their

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,549
statistics are incredible, I urge anybody who wants to help to look to them as a real

00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:48,870
shining example of how to run an initiative like that but back to my thoughts on things

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,380
and stuff.

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,610
Source control, I am not going to go too deep on what source control is if you're not using

00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:02,200
it my now you should be you know that's fine, we're here all good, but as far as a new developer,

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,669
they may have never used it. I remember my friend telling me during a team project at

00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:14,000
his masters university, that will remain nameless he asked his professor, what happens if 2

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,870
people edit the same file, how do we fix that, is there a nice way of doing it, and he was

00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:28,500
told that the project manager should make sure that doesn't happen. {laughter} which

00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:35,090
works, bit cheap though because you have the opportunity to take someone through source

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:42,549
control for the first time, we have been using it for decades now, as long is I have been

00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:43,559
alive. New people

00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,389
don't necessarily have the mental models of what happens when you do a Git ad they get

00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:57,590
push, they may any some help with what might seem like simple or chore Git tasks. I discovered

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,830
when you are doing an open source project you branch you do the Github thing you do

00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,840
branch commit, then open a pull request but because you can do a tremendous amount through

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,019
the Github UI you never get exposed to the commands going on. I have been quite taken

00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:18,909
for using a graphical client for when multiple people are working on it, if you know someone

00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,820
who's struggling with Git, explaining the principles rather than saying these are the

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,630
commands you need to run is probably well worth your time.

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,039
This is one of the things that people are all levels tell everyone, whether it's a firm

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,649
or object orientated programmer trying to get some programming or front end it always

00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:45,950
helps to see alternative ways of doing this. Innumerable talks suggesting you write a list

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:53,110
to get under the skin of a functional programming works. The limit on what you can learn by

00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:59,110
trying new things out doesn't exist, but I think it's important to remember when you

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,130
are new don't dive too deep. You will wind up with a load of breadth of knowledge in

00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:08,139
every which way of doing a single thing but because you have never taken the step forward

00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:15,480
and tried to do more you end up having a coloured few on what some languages can and can't do.

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,750
Keep in mind the next 2 points. They say even in my very young career I have heard a lot

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,820
premature optimisation is the root of all evil. I suggest that goes triply so for you

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,049
software development education. Don't worry about how quickly you are learning slow down

00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:35,850
the relax about, it I know coming to conferences trying to keep up with all the new technologies

00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:41,289
and webapps out there means you feel like you have got to go fast, but honestly learn

00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:45,950
apt your own pace it's super easy to get burned out on learning and not really enjoy what

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,110
you are doing because you are continuously thinking about all the things you don't know.

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,320
I say find your niche, because frankly the stack doesn't matter here we're at JSConf

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,220
we properly have JavaScript in our stack at some point that not necessarily the best fit

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:06,809
for everybody. So what you want to find out it's at what level you want to work. With

00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:10,509
you trying everything you might stumble across something that really clicks for you. For

00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:14,360
me it was the web for you it might be systems programming you might really, really love

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,970
concurrent thread port server, I don't know the words I know they exist I just shove them

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:25,480
into a sentence, sometimes people say oh yeah I get what you mean. I have also heard that

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,789
in systems programming everything has to be web scale. Is that a thing? I don't know,

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:36,190
but yeah. Find your niche and explore more the worse thing that will happen is that you

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:42,009
learn more about something and learn that you don't really care for it that much and

00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,399
that's fine.

00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:48,429
That's minimum viable product idea that goes round take the minimum shippable thing because

00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:54,100
shipping culture it has his own problems but that's for another talk. We should really

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,850
get into habit of teaching new developers they should get it working force, then focus

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,820
on making it better because if they apply the same principles and it doesn't work, they

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,100
have no idea why. Just for those of you in the back that is a pile of sand being held

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:12,850
down by a 3 inch or 4 inch wide strap which looks like it might work, probably

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,690
won't. I have lost count of how many times I have made a start trying to solve something,

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,960
then second guess myself because some inconsequential implementation detail was not perfect them

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,370
then I was completely sidetracked from my train of thought. If I could get offer this

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:35,210
my Github profile would get a lot busier, but the number one thing that led me here

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,210
to talk you all whether that's people in your local dev community, helpful people who answer

00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:45,990
questions on Twitter, people in open source communities people in slack RIRC, everyone

00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,399
and people were the number one thing that inspired me to join this web community. We

00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:55,909
need to start considering interpersonal skills as a major part of levelling up as a junior

00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:58,000
dev.

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,779
We need to remain accountable for our action's programming is not the preserve of the super

00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:06,429
educated anymore you have access to computers that fill entire rooms and can take a punch

00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:13,700
card and spit out some binary, but we have moved past that. Anybody with a computer of

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,649
any kind, anybody who picks up a Firefox OS phone or 30 bucks or whatever can try out

00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:23,590
web programming they can make an app in I think the current record upstairs was something

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,659
like of seconds. They have an app it's there, they can use it, they can interact with it

00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:36,389
they can learn from it immediately, that's fantastic, but the problem with people is

00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:41,149
that they are haters out there. If you go down stack overflow and say hey I am having

00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:45,880
a bit of trouble adding these 2 number again what should I do the first answer is, use

00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:52,250
a jQuery plug-in, no please don't do that. You need to be encouraging, giving them things

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:58,409
to do that are would help them understand because otherwise, certain websites look like

00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:03,000
this. You ask a question, and immediately everybody leaps down your throat oh my God

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,830
you are using angular 1.2 you terrible human being. I always like to think it's GIFs because

00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:16,080
I like animation, but do you know who deserves to learn from you and who you can learn from?

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,360
Literally everyone. Thanks Gary.

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:27,269
So, in short, one year and 26 days ago today, I began my new life as a software developer,

00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:33,179
about 7 weeks ago I moved to Berlin and changed job and I am now a junior front-end dev, I

00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:38,990
am very happy. Because I am standing up here hopefully I can help at least one more person

00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:48,860
gain the confidence to get involved too. So thank you very much I have been Louis Cowper.

00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,970
{applause}

00:24:49,970 --> 00:25:01,059
Actually, is that timer right? If I have got 5 minutes, I have got 3 minutes here. Just

00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:06,440
a quick thing I have got a few minutes, I want to just take a moment to talk about something

00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:15,580
that I have been working really hard on, oh that's not mirroring. That will work. Yeah

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:23,200
so let's look at Hoodie, and Hoodie CSSI have been working on a tool that takes a Markdown

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,990
trial and pretty prints it with chalk it's not really fully done and code blocks don't

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:35,750
look too good. What I have in package JSON is MPM run help I would thoroughly urge anybody

00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:44,600
using MPM as a build tool to try that when you run PMP run as normal you just get a list

00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,159
of the script that can be really be helpful if you already know what all the dependencies

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,059
do but I just want to promote, oh I am off the bottom, sorry.

00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:55,590
When you run MPM as normal you just get a list of the scripts, it can be really helpful

00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,429
if you already know what all the dependencies do, but I just want to promote I'm off the

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:05,720
bottom, ok, sorry, MPM run, help, input file which I hold ooh... what happened there? That

00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:13,389
was fantastic! Still working on it, great, hold on. Come on, stop, there we go, no! No!

00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:20,639
Don't ask me! ! Basically we have the marked down file we can keep in sync, it looks great

00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:29,059
in Github, take the input of run and add comments, tell people why you are doing what you are

00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:35,000
doing, it hopefully will take off and everybody will really like it, it will help you go from

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:44,880
