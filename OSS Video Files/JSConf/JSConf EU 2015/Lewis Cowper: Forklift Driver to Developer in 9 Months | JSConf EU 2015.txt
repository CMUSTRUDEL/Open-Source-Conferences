Title: Lewis Cowper: Forklift Driver to Developer in 9 Months | JSConf EU 2015

Description: 
	Moving up the ladder from forklift driver and general labourer, to front end developer, with a stint in manual testing, was a big challenge. However it’s exactly what I did, and I couldn’t have done it without following a few core principles.

Getting up the nerve to go to local usergroups, and conferences, and discovering a new found love of public speaking, was a huge leap from labouring. Similarly, I discovered contributing to open source wasn’t that big a deal, and some things certain projects did made it really easy! Also, learning about things like source control was super integral to being where I am today.
