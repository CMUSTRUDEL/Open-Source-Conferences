Description: 
	Do you know how JavaScript engines work and why they are so blazingly fast?

Learn about the fundamentals like abstract syntax tree, opcodes, and just-in-time compilation. JavaScript code can be almost as fast as native C++ code. How do engines accomplish this? Lets look into optimization techniques including hidden classes, ahead-of-time compilation, and single instruction multiple data computations, which, if applied correctly, will give your code a turbo boost.

Understand the inner workings of JavaScript engines and learn by examples how to write faster code.

*SpiderMonkey, SquirrelFish (Nitro), Nashorn, and V8 are JavaScript engines for Firefox, Safari, JVM, and Chrome.
