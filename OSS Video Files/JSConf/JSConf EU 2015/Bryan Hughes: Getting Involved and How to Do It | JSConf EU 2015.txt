Title: Bryan Hughes: Getting Involved and How to Do It | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-21
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	Does it seem like everyone else knows more than you? Do you see people on stage or organizing events and think, “I could never do what they do”? Have you felt marginalized by the tech industry? Getting involved can be a daunting prospect, especially if you’re from a marginalized group. But there are a few decent and kind communities out there, and getting involved can be highly rewarding. It’s also a lot easier than you think!

In this talk, I will discuss how I got involved as a not straight male, how you can do it too, and how we can make our communities better and more welcoming for everyone.

Right hi everyone, as Lindsay said my name is Bryan Hughes, I am a front-end

00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,060
developer at Rdio a music streaming company in San Francisco. I am also the lead organiser

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,650
for Meetup group in San Francisco, a member of 2 node.js working group, a somewhat regular

00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:41,510
speaker at conferences and a popular open source project. You could say I am pretty

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,780
involved these days. Today I am going to talk about how to get involved yourself.

00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,370
Most developers tend to go to work and come home each day, that’s the extent of their

00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,320
involvement in tech this is perfectly ok too, I was one of these developers for the first

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,930
3 years of my career. There's a lot more out there though, there are conferences such as

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,110
this one, there's meetups, open source projects, logging and more. As Cate Hutson talked about

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,840
on Friday, getting involved in the community outside of work can be highly rewarding and

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,250
sometimes even necessary but also entails risks especially for people from under-represented

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,740
groups. I want to tell my story of how I got involved in the node.js communities and the

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,500
lessons I learned along the way.

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,759
My journey started one summer at a resort in Florida in the US. I was at J conference

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,560
2013 at the recommendation of friend and I was forever changed. It was there that I first

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,259
learned about NodeBots and I was hooked immediately. Of course I was hooked, why not? It's JavaScript

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,030
and robots, what's not to love about that? But more importantly though, this where I

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:57,009
first met Raquel Valez, AKA a truly amazing person. I wouldn't be here today or be involved

00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:03,979
in robotics if it wasn't for her. I was first inspired to speak at a conference myself.

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,460
Soon after the conference one of the speakers there wrote a blog post titled ‘You Should

00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,720
Speak at JSConf.’ Still coming off the high of the conference I thought you know maybe

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,830
he's right, maybe I could do this too. So full of excitement and energy I submitted

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:24,870
a top proposal for JSConf2014 and it was rejected probably with a fiery burning passion because

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,950
my proposal was pretty terrible. That's ok. We always suck the first time we try to do

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,720
something new. No-one rides a bike perfectly the first time, why should public speaking

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,670
be any different. It takes time and practice but like riding a bike it's a lot of fun it

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,390
helps if you have someone teaching you how to ride though.

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,070
After JSConf I followed Raquel on Twitter I soon found out about NodeBots.sf a JavaScript

00:02:53,070 --> 00:03:01,850
meetup in San Fran. I attended my first meetup, it was incredible. I met many more awesome

00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:10,050
people there so by then my course was set. At a new favourite meetup I found my community.

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,550
I didn't let my first talk rejection get to me too much I realised my first proposal was

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,700
terrible I scrapped that entire idea and came up with a new one. I had been

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,580
working with raspberrypi, like I thought that a lot of people might want to hear about it

00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:30,450
too I wrote a new proposal for Cascadia.js 2014, it was also pretty bad. It was an improvement

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:36,680
over my previous one but certainly still wasn't good and so it was rejected too. Now in this

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,450
proposal which was public, I made a mention of Johnny-five, a JavaScript robotics library.

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,950
This attracted the attention of the project's creator as part of our back and forth online

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,280
he mentioned we should get raspberry pi support into Johnny-five I never worked on an open

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,330
source project that wasn't Java related before, the thought had not even crossed my mind but

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:05,010
now I was intrigued. I wrote a quick plug-in for Johnny-five and submitted a pull request,

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,760
this request was also, it was slow, missing support for pretty much everything, had no

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,979
unit test or any documentation. This is also ok. Because the first version of new software

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:23,090
are usually really incomplete, they get better over time. Since I have rewritten the entire

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:28,160
library I have given it a lot of love it's actually pretty good now. It implements all

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,550
the features it needs to be pretty optimised, has really good documentation to it, but there's

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,890
still a lot I want to do with it, a lot, the least of which is unit tests that are still

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,850
missing to this day. Getting involved is an ongoing process, its ok when you don't get

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,620
everything right the first time. There's plenty of time for that later. You know I am still

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,100
very glad I wrote this plug-in, knowing that other people are using my software to create

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,890
amazing art is immensely gratifying. I also learned that you never know where opportunities

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,570
is going to come from, so always be open to new experiences.

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,370
I still wasn't up to public speaking after my Cascadia.js rejection, I think I set my

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:15,280
sights a bit high. I decided to try something a bit smaller. In the middle of 2014 some

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,870
friends I knew started a new conference called forward.js, playing round with ECMAScript

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,010
6. I decided to submit a proposal for a short 15 minute talk on some odds this proposal

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,820
actually wasn't developed, in fact it was kind of decent, I submitted this proposal

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,610
and this time it was accepted. So it was the first time I had given a talk at a conference

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:43,600
and it went pretty well, it wasn't great, but pretty well. At the time I was really

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,280
worried that someone would ask me questions about ES6 that I didn't know the answer to,

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,550
but at the time there was actually quite bit about ES6 I didn't know. My fears were completely

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,139
unfounded, there was one question I couldn't answer, and even that wasn't a big deal. I

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,180
have since learned that you don't have to be an expert on a topic to speak about that

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:10,570
topic and conference organisers want you to talk and they want to help you be awesome.

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,389
When you see someone speaking at a conference or organising an event or leading a popular

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,580
open source project it's easy to think they are naturally gifted, they were somehow born

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:28,040
for it. We tend to put experts on a pedestal we think they are expert in everything, just

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,440
because they are pretty knowledgeable about this one thing. What you often don't see is

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,440
how much we actually don't know, how much we have failed along the way and all the other

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,650
people that helped get us on this stage. Those of us speaking here at JSConfEU, we have failed

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,180
a lot. We weren't born for it, we don't really know what we're doing, and you know we're

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,280
not experts at least not in the sense that most people assume we are. We're just regular

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,060
people who decide to take a risk one day.

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,090
Around the same time I submitted my forward.js proposal I was at an all day NodeBot access

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:10,680
hacka events. Raquel casually mentioned to me maybe I should organise the meeting. I

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,090
had not given organising a second thought at this point, surely organisers have tons

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,340
of experience being organising for forever, how could I possibly help organise, I am so

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:26,560
new I just screw it up they wouldn't want me anyway. Round and round my head went. Raquel

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,010
made me think otherwise. I reached out to her and Dan Shaw, the other lead organiser.

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,990
As it turned out the timing couldn't have been better, the current organisers were working

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,910
on some awesome new things and they didn't have as much time to devote to NodeBots.sf

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:46,680
as they once did. This is when I got to know Dan Shaw better, he's been so helpful I knew

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:55,690
nothing about organising going in. That's ok. We all start at nothing, but we don't

00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:00,190
have to do it alone. There are other people willing to help you if you are willing to

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:06,449
take the risk and try it. Dan Shaw along with a few others were ones that help me. We don't

00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:10,979
become speakers or organisers or project leaders because we’re innately more talented than

00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:16,370
other people, we're not. We get involved because other people came before us and they were

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,979
supportive enough, and generous enough and welcoming enough, to give us a chance and

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:23,229
help us succeed.

00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:29,460
It's our responsibility to pay it forward too. One day earlier this year I was hanging

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,339
out in the Johnny-five chap room someone dropped a link to a node.js that recommend we start

00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:40,000
node.js hardware working group. My other experience so far had taught me to jump on opportunities

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,420
presented to me even I don't think I am qualified I thought sure what the hell. Now I am the

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:55,339
de facto lead for the node.js hardware working group, not sure how that happened exactly

00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:01,730
definitely working out how to lead in online group but things are happening. Then no conference

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:08,170
US happened there were a number of discussions about diversity and the node.js collaborators

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,809
in particular. One of discussion was the node.js diversity working group I am also a member

00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:20,389
of it. This group is still very new we're still figuring our what our mission is exactly.

00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:24,420
There have been some very tough challenges for this group to solve as well, I am excited

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,389
but still nervous to see where it goes. I hope I am able to bring some value to this

00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:34,829
working group although I constantly question my abilities of being able to do so. One point

00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:40,490
I actually thought about quitting the group altogether because the challenges seemed insurmountable.

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,129
Then someone I have never met before, commented on a PR I had open someone whose affected

00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:49,879
by the lack of diversity in the node.js collaborators. Their comments and kind words gave me the

00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:56,220
determination that I lacked until then. I might have quit without them.

00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,009
People don't just help us get into a community, they are the reason that we stay. When I think

00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:05,160
of everything that important in my life in the end it's all about people. That's what

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:13,410
motivates me the people, and I think that's what motivates most everyone else too.

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:20,930
Looking back across the years I realise I suffer from imposter syndrome, I am simply

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,679
going to read this definition to you. “Imposter syndrome is a situation where someone feels

00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,709
like an imposter or fraud, they feel their accomplishments are nowhere near as good as

00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:31,449
those of the people

00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:36,149
round them. Usually their accomplishments are just as good and the person is applying

00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:41,619
a unfairly high standard to themselves and not to others.”

00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:46,589
You know, I think this is something we're all prone to, it's human nature, but it's

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,199
important that we recognise it for what it is though, a trick that our minds play on

00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:55,059
us, I sincerely believe that every single one of you in the audience is capable of speaking

00:10:55,059 --> 00:11:00,240
at an conference of contributing to an open source project of writing blog posts we're

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,499
not going to be great at all of these things, very few people are but everyone has talent

00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,119
at something.

00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:13,569
I realise that the title of this talk is the risks and rewards of getting involved in how

00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:19,009
to do, I have not talked about the risk or how to do it have I, let me address the how

00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,139
to do it first.

00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:26,670
If I have not made it obvious already, it's not as hard as people through it's not some

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,829
drama we put you through, nor do we only accept the best of the best of the best. If you are

00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:38,529
willing to put yourself out there we'll help you on your journey. If you feel motivated

00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:44,189
to do something, commit to that motivation, then reach out to others already doing it.

00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:51,069
Yep that's it, that's the secret to getting involved. Commit to doing, it then ask for

00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:52,879
help.

00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,459
When you feel motivated or the thing is though the process is easier for some people than

00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:02,779
it is for others. Exclusion, marginalisation and existing lack of diversity are very real

00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:06,589
problems conspire to keep under represented people out of our development communities.

00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:12,809
I am going to switch gears and we're going to talk about this. I am going to start as

00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:16,259
I have everything else with a story.

00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:23,889
So, I grew up in a conservative part of Texas in the United States I'm also a liberal, bisexual,

00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:31,179
atheist, among other things, I did not belong in Texas, San Francisco seemed like a paradise,

00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:40,709
it was far from the reason I moved there, I thought San Francisco was better, companies

00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:50,019
were diverse and welcoming,, it wasn't the cesspool of disablist, racist, xenophobic

00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:59,290
assholes that it is! {Laughter}

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:11,019
As a - I encountered bigotry, I was more or less used to it, I was also an out back fan,

00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:17,860
there is that too. I didn't view myself as part of the problem, I mean, I never hit on

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,329
women or men at professional events, I never said anything overtly misogynistic online

00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:30,989
or indulge in harassing behaviour, surely I was one of the good guys right, well no,

00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:39,110
I wasn't. I was contributing to the problem in my own way, I see that now.

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:45,939
Back then I had no idea what microaggressions were, what intersectionality was, that being

00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:54,230
silent maintained the status quo and the status quo was pretty terrible. Here is the truth

00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:04,720
of the matter, the tech industry card deck is stacked, you white, white, American white

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,019
male straight, you are automatically at a disadvantage, our industry is fundamentally

00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:16,899
broken and we are all implicit not standing against the current status quo is to support

00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:26,910
it, it's to condone harassment and abuse, sitting comfortably in your own situation,

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,920
ignoring those around you suffering, is to say, "Fuck you, I've got mine", if you

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,699
aren't contributing to make are industry better you are contributing to making it worse. Me,

00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:46,869
I was part of the problem, I was contributing to making it worse. I still am to some extent,

00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:51,519
but, now I'm trying to be part of the solution too.

00:14:51,519 --> 00:15:03,009
So, what changed? I started listening. I started believing women, people of colour, LGBT, disabled,

00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:08,149
when they say there is a problem. To be clear I'm not an expert on this stuff, not even

00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:18,009
close, I don't think I ever can be. I still screw up. That's ok too, as long as I catch

00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:26,220
myself or have someone call me out on it apologise promptly and take steps not to do it again,

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:32,119
these last steps are critical, making mistakes are own, we're only human and we're going

00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:37,480
to make mistakes, but not learning from those mistakes and repeating them over hand over

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:48,189
hand over again, that is real harm. So, a few years ago, I was really unhappy at a previous

00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:55,600
job. At the time it was difficult for me to put my finger on exactly why it was unhappy,

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,379
later on I came to realise it was because this company was pretty typical for Silicon

00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:07,359
Valley, misogynistic and homophobic and on and on and on, the culture of this company

00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:13,959
was the antithesis of inclusivity, shouting attacks, poor reports from meetings, home

00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:20,069
phobic slurs used frequently by everybody up and down the power chain, social justice

00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:29,480
voyeurs and the PC police, stories and rumours of much, much worse. There is a reason that

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,470
there are only two women engineers in a team of 60 and both of them were brought in through

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,629
acquisitions, the company didn't care about hiring women and if they did there was a hostile

00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:46,069
work environment for any woman unlucky enough to enter. For me, I didn't feel comfortable

00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:53,589
being myself there, I didn't come out to a single co-worker, I was scared to come out,

00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:58,399
I didn't feel I would be accepted for who I was and would face a wave of harassment

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:10,549
if I did, so I quit, it was the single best thing I did for my entire career. I'm picking

00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:20,010
on this company, not because they are noteworthy, but because they are average, that's a problem.

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,990
When I went looking for a new job my number one requirement was a not terrible culture,

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:32,990
everything else was secondary. I found Rdio, it's made up of some pretty amazing people,

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,139
we're not perfect and we still have some work to do to make the culture better and increase

00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:44,080
diversity, I'm actually optimistic we can do it, I'm comfortable being myself there.

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,630
So, what does this all have to do with community? Well, my experiences of life and work taught

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:59,730
me something crucially important, what I learned is this: the reason many people get involved,

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,649
or stay involved, or leave the community or quit a job is directly related to how comfortable

00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:11,850
they're being themselves, this is true whether it's an employer, a communicate, a circle

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:17,980
of friends or a family. You know, we have to be kind to one another, we have to be,

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,840
all of us. Even if you are not an organiser a regular speaker or attendee even, we are

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:32,039
all responsible, organisers are the ones that set the initial culture for the community

00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:37,320
and they have to take disciplinary action when needed, but you know we can't be everywhere

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,720
at once, we are not privy between very conversation or interaction, we have to change it to where

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,840
entitled people are sensitive to not saying bigoted things, but where people say thing

00:18:50,840 --> 00:19:02,080
irregardless of sexual orientation, race gender or anything else.

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,620
I was at a robotics conference last year, amazing speakers, code of conduct and organisers

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:19,620
that genuinely care about the community, one of my best friends, was there as an invited

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,750
expert, hanging out at a booth with

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:31,139
her hardware, this guy asks her point-blank, "Did you bad build this?" In a single sentence

00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:36,330
he managed to dismiss her abilities and make her feel excluded, I was there as an invited

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:42,029
expert to, no one said that to me or any of the other invited experts that were men, whether

00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:48,500
it was in intentional or not, it happened because she was a woman. These kinds of incidents

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,320
happen all the time too, there have been probably been at least 100 similar incidents happening

00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:01,299
here too, organisers can't be everywhere at once, we need your help.

00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:09,289
So, how can you help? Well, the first step is knowing what to look for. We tend to know

00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:14,940
our own worlds well, what people similar to us are going through, the key is being able

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,850
to cull activate a basic understanding of people not like us are going through, it takes

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:26,590
a considered effort to learn and requires a lot of practice, it's really hard, it's

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:32,210
also really necessary. So, start learning about social justice, you know, understand

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:38,240
what privilege is and how it manifests itself. Listen to and believe when, people of colour,

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,470
LGBT, the disabled and others when they speak about harassment and exclusion. When someone

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,059
calls you out on your inappropriate behaviour, apologise properly, think about what you did

00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:54,480
and change your behaviour. Call out others when they are acting inappropriately and do

00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,850
it in the moment, if it's safe to do so. It may be scary and awkward, it may make others

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:07,580
uncomfortable, but that's actually the point. Making people uncomfortable and upset is how

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:13,789
we affect change. If you are more involved already, recognise you have a responsibility

00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:17,720
to the rest of the community, don't speak or attend conferences that don't have a code

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:24,909
of conduct or are known for a hostile environment, make it known publicly why you are not attending.

00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:30,750
For people in positions of power, make sure you are building a good community, make inclusivity

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,470
a central pillar of every last thing that you do.

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:41,279
You know, don't just let it be an after thought. How you treat people, in the community that

00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:47,000
you build, are the only things that matter in the end. Don't know where to start, the

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,730
Geek Feminism Wiki, model view culture who's links are in here in the slide are excellent

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:58,860
resources and I encourage you all to view them.

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:04,500
The Johnny-Five community is good so far as communities go, we're not perfect, no one

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,610
is there are lot of caring and empathetic people in the community, others communities

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:18,399
can be like this too, not just communities, our work places can be better as well. Bosses

00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:22,179
aren't the only ones responsible for creating safe spaces even if they share the bulk of

00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:28,090
the burden, we all play a part in making our own work places better.

00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:34,019
When it comes to people, the tech industry is broken, it's the new Wall Street, we suffer

00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:39,070
from a severe lack of diversity and diversity is actually getting worse, not better. Lack

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:45,840
of diversity hurts business. It hurts productivity, it hurts creativity. An industry of young,

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:53,059
affluent, kiss gender white male, only caters to the young able white kiss gender white

00:22:53,059 --> 00:23:00,679
men, it assists the majority of the population of this planet, for fundamental and far more

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:07,779
important, lack of diversity hurts people. It hurts are brothers and sisters, fuck the

00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:11,029
business case, this is about people and dignity and respect

00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:18,009
and making the world a better place, not just for a few, but for everyone. Our industry

00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:23,490
doesn't have to be terrible. We can actually be the sources of hope and change we so often

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:29,220
like to pretend that we are. We can be a part of communities filled with empathy and love

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:37,710
and respect for everyone. We can make this happen, but all of us, all of us, are needed

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,570
to make that difference.

00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,429
