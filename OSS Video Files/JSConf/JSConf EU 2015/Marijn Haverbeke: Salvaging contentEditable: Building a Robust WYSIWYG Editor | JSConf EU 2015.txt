Title: Marijn Haverbeke: Salvaging contentEditable: Building a Robust WYSIWYG Editor | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-18
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	Web-based WYSIWYG editors are notorious for spitting out a distasteful HTML soup. In this talk I’ll show how I implemented an editor that, instead of trying to filter and clean this soup, takes control away from the browser’s contentEditable implementation, and reinterpret user actions as operations on our own semantic document model (i.e. not HTML). The result is a WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) editor, more predictable than classic WYSIWYG, and just as user friendly.

Thank you, so what I am going to talk about here today is how to build a WYSIWYM editor

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,230
in the browser.

00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,390
By what you see is what you mean, we usually mean something like what you see is what you

00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:52,530
get, WYSIWYG where you have a visual representation of you content and can just edit that in the

00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:00,260
obvious classical way, but instead of editing things like

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:08,890
font size margins you are editing semantic information so you get reduced cleaner representation

00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:15,910
of the document where you say this is a paragraph, this is a link, and not this is Georgia 15

00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,270
pixels italic.

00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:25,280
This is usually beneficial when you want to have users edit content and you then later

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,320
want to use it in a different layout in a different context or you want to inspect it,

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,990
and transform it somehow, it's very useful to have semantic information about the content

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,660
rather than just layout information.

00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:49,950
So, my newest project is called ProseMirror I am going to be talking about CodeMirror

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:58,640
and ProseMirror you shouldn't confuse them, ProseMirror is a semantic rich text editor,

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,710
so something like a WYSIWYG but for clean content.

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:12,930
This was recently launched and open sourced and it's my attempt to build an editor where

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:20,070
you can define a schema for you content and have the editor automatically enforce that

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,910
and provide the user with editing actions that stay within your schema so if you have

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:32,070
for example your Github you have you document model that includes references to issues and

00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:38,130
commits you can't extend your document model to have first clause now it's links to commits

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:45,750
or links to users or whatever and have your users actually be working with a data model

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,209
that corresponds to what you actually want to work with.

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:59,010
ProseMirror also supports collaborative editing and is generally I hope the future of in-browser

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,959
prose writing.

00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,180
So yeah I am going to be talking about how it's implemented and a major factor in any

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:17,290
kind of rich text editing implementation is the browser API called contentEditable.

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:26,500
This is what enables many browser almost all in-browser WYSIWYGs to exist at all if you

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:35,790
talk to people who have worked with it you will get complaints and lots of horrible stories.

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,129
So let me give a bit of background history.

00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:47,620
So the year is 1979, Microsoft is on a roll when it comes to browser they just ported

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,569
JavaScript, introduced dynamic DOM manipulation then I guess I don't really know what happened

00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:59,010
but assume someone there said let's make our browser and editor so people can write HTML

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,760
in the browser it's a very commendable idea.

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:11,440
What they ended up doing in IE 4 is introducing a feature called designMode a property you

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,669
set on your document which makes the whole document editable what it means is still not

00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:25,289
completely clear there's no spec that covers this you can type into it you can back space

00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:35,530
out stuff and a companion to this API is document.exec command which your scripts can call string

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:44,000
like bold or italic or insert ordered list or delete to perform other editing actions

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,750
on the document.

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:54,830
What you could do since IE 4 is create a frame, set to it be editable and then bind some key

00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:04,300
binding and buttons some various exec command codes you would have a basic WYSIWYG editor.

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:11,130
This has worked since 1997, then in 2000 they added a second feature very simple to that

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:17,280
called contentEditable this is the same as designMode but per DOM node instead of the

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,590
whole document.

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:24,700
You don't have to create an iFrame you can just in your existing content set the switch

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,349
to make it editable to let your users add something to a piece of your page then save

00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:33,390
it somehow.

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,390
Other

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:40,159
important thing you could do since this feature was introduced was set pieces of an editable

00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:46,849
DOM node to be non editable you could set it back to false to be inside of the node,

00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:53,270
that means that well the users can edit text round it but they can't move their cursor

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,570
into that node and start editing there.

00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,280
This is also a big improvement, it allows you to protect some part of your document

00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,760
or insert widgets that are not necessarily editable.

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,810
So, this was pretty much before the big JavaScript boom but people were slowly starting to use

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:21,810
this at some point it become really wide spread, I think CK editors from the early 2000s not

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:28,200
sure when tiny MC started they were libraries reping this and people using content management

00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,270
systems.

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:39,520
At Mozilla there was a feeling we have to do something like this, it's a useful feature,

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,730
but they didn't quite like what Microsoft had done, and this was the browser war so

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:50,200
it was not like there was a very good communication of standards process.

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,279
They spent sometime trying to come up with a better solution but they never really agreed

00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,880
on something.

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,140
So in the end they said ok we'll just do what Internet Explorer does so we're no longer

00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,750
left out when it comes to rich text editor in-browser.

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:12,930
So they copied this feature, of course it didn't exactly copy it they some parts of

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,830
it were no use they left those out, they thought they knew better solutions for some other

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:23,740
parts for example where IE would add text if you made something bold, they said no we

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,539
have CSS that font width on them.

00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:38,550
IE had the feature on both major browsers then and a few years later, actually took

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:47,830
until 2007 which is past the JavaScript boom that Firefox also added support for contentEditable,

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:54,240
and then the other browsers Safari, Chrome, Opera, all also took up the feature and implemented

00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:02,050
it one way or another and now it's kind of considered part of the expected API in a modern

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,620
graphical browser.

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,090
So why is this a good thing?

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,650
The other controls that we have to implement editing in a browser are text area and text

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,830
input.

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:25,010
Both of which are constrained to atomic blobs of plain text you can't really do many of

00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:31,480
the things you want to do with them like doing rich text in them is a non starter and even

00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,830
adding some helpful widgets or syntax highlighting is almost impossible to do on top of text

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,200
area.

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,580
So it's great then we have an alternative that we can do solid rich text editing or

00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:51,810
more or less solid rich text editing in a browser, things like content management systems

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:59,050
that exist entirely online, earlier code editors were also based on this.

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,690
This is wonderful.

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:14,910
Except of course, it has problems a major thing HTML scope is not gigantic, you might

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:25,130
not want that whole scope for example, first version of CodeMirror it was based on contentEditable

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:31,710
images links whole tables into the editor I had to somehow deal with this.

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:38,450
So you can do that you can filter content, you properly want to filter the content anyway,

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:44,020
it comes out of this by default, it's very, very ugly.

00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:52,550
So that modern WYSIWYG browsers have pretty advanced mechanisms for cleaning out the HTML

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:59,980
inside of the editor, but then there's still all the browser differences, there's no spec,

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,220
each browser.

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,830
This is a very big scope of what editing HTML really means, there's cursor motion through

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:13,130
tables, adding columns to table, what happens when you present enter in a definition list,

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,110
what exactly is the cursor position if it's moving across the boundaries of block elements,

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,920
what is a valid cursor position.

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:27,830
These are all valid questions, they came up with slightly different answers to them.

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,580
Then there's bugs.

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Many

00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,580
bugs.

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,640
The feeling I get is that no-one really maybe except for the few engineers that started

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,550
this thing, no-one really felt like implementing this but it was something that is needed and

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:47,000
expected and so all the browser vendors had to somehow ad this dragon of a sub browser

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,470
that interacted with everything in all kinds of horrible ways, bugs with language and bug

00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,050
trackers for years an years it seems no-one really cared all that much.

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:06,560
The situation has recently improved, currently on modern browsers you can really make some

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,800
assumptions about what is going to happen to your HTML as the user is editing it, didn't

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,320
used to be the case in CodeMirror 1, I have just piles and piles of workarounds to deal

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,030
with all these weird issues.

00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:27,690
It was only a text editor, it will be a lot worse if you actually support rich content.

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:36,680
So, people really got annoyed with this and then there is a generation of editors, it

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,460
started with code editors, who just say, "Ok, we're not going to touch this at all, we'll

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:50,190
figure something out ourselves, we implement everything, so we implement our own selection,

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:56,920
just the DOM is not actually editable, we pretend it is by capturing events and changing

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:04,620
your documents you see on the screen in response to these events."

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:11,800
The first one to pull this off was the Ace code editor at that point I was still messing

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:18,120
about with contentEditable in my own code editing, I thought ok this is clearly superior,

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,790
I just dropped content editor and never went back.

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:32,810
Google docs, uses this, what you see blinking on the green is a little gif that's hidden

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:40,610
and shown periodically, you can very far, on desk top browsers you can get a good editing

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,560
experience using this technique.

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,550
At some point you do run into problems, if you maintain your own selection entirely,

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,490
you get all the complexity of bi directional text on your plate you have to implement what

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,600
the cursor is supposed to be doing, if it moves right to left, then enters left to right

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:12,960
text and there is an island of... if you are mixing Arabic or Hebrew or other scripts you

00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:19,040
get islands inside of your paragraphs that are running in different directions, people

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
need like this.

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,360
Like Arabic or Hebrew writers really need this to be work, you can't do much with your

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,030
editor if it doesn't work, it's gigantically difficult to get it right.

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:37,779
The content menu should shows cut and paste, if you click on it, if you have a non-editable

00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:45,350
gif there, it won't know.

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,050
You can find the hex for this, the hex for this is to pop-up a tiny transparent text

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:56,490
area under the cursor when the user right clicks and hooks up the right thing when he

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:03,480
cuts or pastes, you can get it to work but it's painful or awkward.

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,410
Then, mobile interfaces, touch interfaces became widespread and the integration Between

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:20,840
the selection and touch interface is very deep and very subtle, producing a native selection,

00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,400
a native field to manipulate the selection when you are not actually letting the browser

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:32,320
know about the selection is almost impossible, I don't think anyone has pulled it off yet.

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,300
So this may not be the right solution either.

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:43,380
So maybe let's meet in the middle and this is the idea that prompted ProseMirror, give

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:51,710
the editor the visible DOM, when the user does something and it generates an event,

00:14:51,710 --> 00:15:01,270
we step in and say doing do anything browser, we'll handle this and get - isolate this from

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:08,740
a lot of the horrors of contentEditable, the random manipulation by the DOM is no longer

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:15,380
happens, it allows us to define the model and be the

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:23,390
only one touching that, in the older approach the DOM is your document model.

00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:30,160
You don't keep your own copy of the data you let the DOM determine what the document looks

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,150
like, you don't know what the browser will do with this, it's like building on quicksand,

00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:41,680
things might change, notes that you somehow depending on existing might be replaced by

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:53,790
a copy, having full control offer your document model is a very useful thing to do and I think

00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:04,779
some of the other WYSIWYGs that have cropped up recently are also moving in this direction.

00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:05,779
.

00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:09,390
Yeah, ProseMirror is designed from the ground up with the assumption that we have a document

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:16,160
model and then there is a DOM, the DOM is a view on the document model, the document

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:23,420
is solid we have it entirely, when it's changed we update the DOM ourselves and show the user

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:34,250
the pseudo editable thing, it's supposed to be editable but we don't let them edict directly,

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:41,130
the selection is not a real selection you can manipulate on a touch interface, bi directional

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,410
cursor motion by bi directional text can be left through the browser, we dent want to

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,270
think about that, that saves complexity.

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:54,620
Of course implementing our own document model and all possible changes is also a lot of

00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,620
complexity, but this is complexity I think you want as a text editor, you want to define

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,020
it in one predictable, well-defined way.

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:12,930
You want to make them customisable, you want to cut out the browser when it comes to that.

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:20,130
So I'm going to go into ProseMirror document model for a bit, three base much like the

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:28,240
DOM, if you have a document with a list of three items, it looks something like this.

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,590
You get a list now or three item notes, paragraph notes with some text content in it.

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,730
One thing that it does very differently from the DOM it's a persistent data structure,

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:46,400
so if you update it you create a new version and the old version is untouched, so you just

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,929
don't go in there and start adding children, I don't know where.

00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:58,530
There is a well-defined set of possible updates and you apply an update to get a new document.

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,000
This is not as expensive as it sounds, it can do data sharing if you an item to this

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:11,090
list here, you just reuse the old item notes and make a copy of the document and the list

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,630
notes, the fourth child in the list notes, you are only copying two notes rather than

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,550
your whole document structure.

00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,830
Another thing that ProseMirror does differently from the DOM, when you have in line content

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:34,250
this is how you represent a paragraph with a bees of link and note text in it, you create

00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:40,900
a subtree with for example a strong note and you put the content that's strong under that.

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:47,380
ProseMirror actually makes linear, where in line paragraph content is always a sequence

00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:54,270
of pieces of text with styling information and images or notes that can appear here,

00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,880
they don't nest, beyond the paragraph level there is no nesting you can see how this is

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,770
harder to read than this.

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,950
It's the same when you are dealing with it in code, a lot of the things you want to do

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,900
are much easier on this, for example, verifying that you are not emphasising a piece of text

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:18,320
twice, it's trivial and this tree representation is a pain in the... tree representation similarly

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:25,460
if we want to represent positions in the paragraph we can just a character offset and we

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,520
don't have to worry about tree relations.

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:35,800
So this was a big win and made it easier to define a lot of things.

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,190
So let's see what happens when ProseMirror captures events.

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:45,080
You have your editor, it's rendered a piece of editable DOM corresponding to the document

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:52,590
it has itself in memory software, and someone presses 'A', we capture an event for that

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,920
and create a change object.

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:02,390
Changes in ProseMirror are first class objects which you can store and pass around and we'll

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,000
come back to that later.

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,990
Then we apply the change object to our current documents, get the new documents, make that

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:16,600
the current documents and schedule a DOM update, similarly if you press 'Backspace', you just

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,650
compute what you want to be deleting with backspace, create a change, take the content

00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:29,260
of the clipboard, pass it into our document format and replace the selection with this

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:35,260
document fragment to get another change object.

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:40,429
Updating the DOM is then done by, as I scheduling updates using request information frames,

00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:46,799
the next time the browser does an actual redraw it will first run are code which is responsible

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,390
for making sure the DOM reflects the current document the nice thing about the persistent

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:59,130
dock searches we can do pretty much react, we can div the document with the current document

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:04,540
and make the changes only that are necessary to the DOM to move to the new document, this

00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:13,559
is insanely efficient and fast, we can just do one point to compare, ok, nothing changed

00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,240
here and move on to the next note.

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:28,420
Of course it's not entirely perfect, in some cases parses do not fire good events, - you

00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:35,580
write click and choose another spelling of this world, then it will just modify the DOM

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,700
and then say, "Input", meaning something changed, you don't know anything about it.

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,300
So, we have to deal with that and in this case we just take the part of the DOM, like

00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,559
the block elements around the cursor, reparse those, div those with our understanding of

00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:57,559
what those parts of that document look like and arrive at change from that, fortunately

00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:04,740
I've only run into this problem for simple textual changes and deriving a simple text

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:13,210
change is safe, nothing weird can happen there, so far this is working well I'm still expecting

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,400
at some point to run into more problems here.

00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:28,100
So, having all these persistent objects representing everything in a nice value way, we can define

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:36,410
a kind of algebra of changes, the basic operation is applying the change to a document.

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,780
Here we have a blue thing for a document and an orange thing for a change and we apply

00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:48,290
that getting a new document, in this case we delete the part in 0 paragraph between

00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:58,809
character off set 2 and 8, we get a new document object and also a map.

00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:06,340
A map is a position map, it's a way to associate positions in the pre-change version of the

00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,470
document with positions in the post change document, in this case we can query this map

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:18,630
to ask cursor position in the first paragraph at position 11 in the old document, where

00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,750
is this in the new document.

00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:26,160
It will say, "It's positioned 05", meaning the fifth character in the first... this is

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,470
mainly used for making the cursor move as the document changes, so it shouldn't jump

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,640
around but stay in its position.

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,720
There is a bunch of nice things you can

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,560
do with this, like checking pieces of the document you just create two positions in

00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,059
the document around the part you are interested in, you keep mapping those to the new document

00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:54,780
and you end up knowing where the text you are checking ended up, it's also essential

00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:01,430
for collaborative editing, it allows us by mapping the positions associated with the

00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:07,490
change object to move changes from one document to another version of that document.

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:15,700
So, for example, if we had beyond this delete operation we had another change object saying,

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:25,220
"Insert a character at position 11", we can now say that same change but applied to the

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:32,450
second document is, insert the same character at position 5, so if you have a collaborative

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:40,360
editing set up and two users make it concurrently, one of them will end up going first and the

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:46,780
other one will have this change that they have made, but that they're not able to apply

00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,940
to the current document because the document changed in the meantime.

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:55,670
They can use this approach to take the change that the other user made, move their own changeover

00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:01,770
it and then apply it and retry pushing it to the server, so it's kind of like, get to

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:07,350
base, you try to push, you get a conflict, you try to rebase locally and then you try

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,770
to repush again, it works quite well, there is quite a bit to it actually, you can find

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:20,222
a long discrimination on my blog, it works quite well, it's a relatively simple and solid

00:25:20,222 --> 00:25:21,780
way to do collaborative editing.

00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:28,340
There is more applications of this, say change tracking, if you just keep a history of all

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,929
your changes, you can always find out where a piece of the document originated, stuff

00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:34,470
like that.

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:40,270
I'm sure there is more, we haven't really explored this far yet, but it's a nice place

00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,280
to, nice basis to build on.

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,770
Then I want to, very briefly talk about the future.

00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:55,090
So, the W 3 C is working on an update to this contentEditable standard which would allow

00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:01,330
a new mode of contentEditable, where you are supposed to do exactly this, the document

00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:08,570
isn't editable, you are supposed to capture events and edit the inventory yourself, then

00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,820
they will also have to define a few more events for stuff like the spell checking issue that

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:20,960
I showed before and a bunch more like this, but yeah, that would be nice because it relives

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:28,500
the browser vendors of maintaining this whole horrible blob of code and it gives editor

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,730
implementers a view of how to implement a robust solid editor, without going insane

00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,750
in the process.

00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,410
Of course, you never know when W 3 C standard will actually end up in browsers, but I'm

00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,809
told that browsers are enthusiastic about this, probably for the reasons I mentioned,

00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:51,080
it will probably be happening, but the specification isn't finished yet, it will probably be a

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,380
long time.

00:26:53,380 --> 00:27:00,420
This is the URLs, the ProseMirror.net and Github.com/ProseMirror.

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:11,679
Feel free to play with it, it's not finished yet but it works as it is, the major big thing

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:18,030
that has to improve is the API or language for defining your own document schemers and

00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:24,020
having flexible for all the things you might want in your document schemer.

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:31,200
We are having a meet up on Monday around this project here in Berlin, if you think you might

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:38,760
be interested, go to discuss.ProseMirror.net, a discussion forum and one of the topics is

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
this

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,650
meet up, you are welcome to apply as well.

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,710
That's it, thank you for listening.

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:44,880
