Title: Cate Huston: Some Things Iâ€™ve Learned About Color | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-20
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	Burnout saps the joy from creating and leaves the world in shades of grey. What do you do when you realise your work is meaningless and you dread going in every day? As an engineer, you can analyse the system, determine what is missing, and inject some much needed color.

Thanks.

00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:39,440
When we talk about burn out we talk about three things and we don't always clarify what

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,530
we're talking about, we use it kind of interchangeably.

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,140
So the first is depression.

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,860
If you are depressed that's a medical problem that requires medical help, I'm not a medical

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,810
professional and I'll give you no advice on this topic.

00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,140
The second thing is straight up over work.

00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,100
You can't work constantly.

00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,470
Everything we know about 80 hour work weeks says that why we're not working them when

00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,079
we think they're and two they're not sustainable.

00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:18,930
I really like this, you get sent to Bora Bora if you work too much.

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,969
The third thing is what I want to talk about today, we expect and ask more of are jobs

00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:32,450
than we get from them, so there is this gap of what we need and what we have and if it

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:39,560
goes on for too long, or it gets too large, that's when we start to feel burnt out.

00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,180
You know, I often think that these things can to go, write, like I know for myself,

00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,390
being creative is so much a part of being happy, burn out, depression, where does one

00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,010
begin and the other one end, they're distinct problems.

00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:03,780
A few years ago I moved to Australia to run an iOS team, we went to, it was started before

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,090
I arrived within six months, I kept my hours 45 a week, I would still come home on Friday

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,950
night and feel like my brain had bled out through my eyes.

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,370
Then it was done and you know, they would like this guy is going to ship next month,

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,239
go and help him, he didn't ship next month, or the month after.

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,790
In fact I think it was about eight months later.

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:37,819
It was really hard from running my own little team to working on a project that wasn't really

00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,870
running effectively.

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,620
In this position where like I had no influence over making that better.

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,139
Add to this like the super miserable experience of being harassed at work and the awful HR

00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:58,569
process that ensued, I was in a really bad place emotionally and my job was just like

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,150
not fulfilling.

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,239
So I tried to double down on my career, I'll just work on Saturdays, I just need to work

00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,180
harder, I'm going to do a side project.

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,220
So I started doing a side project and then there was a reorganisation and it was clear

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,829
that the side project was never going to launch either, I realised that what I needed was

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,629
to ship, that's what I missed.

00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:31,919
The answer was not internal side projects, but my own personal side project.

00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,019
As an extra thing I had to - I think this was the worst manager I ever had, he explained

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,890
to me that he believed by never giving me positive feedback he was training me not to

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,589
need any {Laughter}.

00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:50,199
If anyone is contemplating this, it doesn't work!

00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:58,139
{Laughter} So, as I shifted my focus to external projects I got some much needed positive feedback

00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,389
as well.

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:06,139
So, it turns out that this was not an entirely, like, random realisation and I didn't invent

00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,189
anything here.

00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:13,599
There are six main causes of professional burn out, the Maslach burn out, there is an

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,070
inventory and a book associated with it called 'The truth about burn out' the first one is

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,110
lack of control, that sounds familiar, hey!

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:33,470
Wait, then the next one, in sufficient reward, also familiar.

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,370
Lack of community.

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,520
I went through this list and I'm like, Huh, you know, this was the first project in a

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,270
while that I'd been on where I was the only woman on the team and there were a number

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,300
of reasons why I felt very lonely but that was one of them.

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,330
The fourth, absence of fairness.

00:04:53,330 --> 00:05:00,830
Yeah, you know I've been successful and like the result was that I ended up in a place

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,020
where I felt like I couldn't succeed.

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,580
The fifth is conflict in values.

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,990
You know, I value execution on a product.

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,660
The team, they like decided that what they should be doing is replying a platform to

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,560
build their project on, obviously I disagree with that, but this not a talk about poor

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,900
engineering decisions, that would need way more than 25 minutes!

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,479
The 6th is work overload.

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,520
I look at this list and like these are all problems we could use side projects to help

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,599
with except for number 6, yeah, it would probably hurt with number 6, I do see that.

00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:50,270
It's really hard to think of a side project when you are feeling, you know, a bit dead

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,819
inside.

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:57,770
It's really hard to think that you have anything to offer anybody else's side project when

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:03,430
the people that you work with day-to-day don't seem to appreciate what you do.

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:11,120
My solution was to go back to my most recently abandoned side project, we all have one, right.

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,180
So, I had this idea that, like, you know when you look on your photographs on flickr or

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,610
whatever I thought it would be cool to visualise a photograph stream just pulling out the dominant

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:29,849
colours from them, so the cool whites of Iceland, lush green of Bali, the like orange and red

00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:37,150
of Canadian Fall, it would tell it's only story in a abstract way.

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,930
So I got so far as this layout, this is the most efficient way to layout circles, it's

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:48,819
called a sunflower layout, so I just was tainting the RGB value and in the one on the right

00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:54,479
I just made it very close together, I kind of like this, I imagine if I was to time travel

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,759
it would jump through something like that.

00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,360
The next step was to pull the dominant colour out of a photograph, like if someone solved

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,610
this the internet will help me.

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,360
The internet failed me.

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:21,060
But it did provide some interesting information, image is array of pixels, a pixel is a square

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:34,949
of colour, there is a colour space all the HSV space, the HSV is actually a lot closer

00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:41,219
to the way we think about colour, so the different colours go round in the circle and those are

00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:48,210
the hue, the saturation, that we might think about as intensity is the diameter and then

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,400
the high is brightness.

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,529
So at the bottom everything is black.

00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:59,880
So, I was like, ok, you know, count the pixels, check the colour.

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,590
Put them in buckets and, you know, we'll have that dominant colour.

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,669
It will be fine.

00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:10,610
This totally worked, but it turns out that the dominant colour is often a little bit

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:19,259
sludgy, so the dominant colour on the left that's the dominant colour extracted from

00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,259
the image.

00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:25,610
So I'm making these test images to see what happens, I would only show things in a certain

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,069
range of the dominant colour, I started making the cool partially coloured images and I could

00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:36,279
see better what was going on.

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,590
So I made my visualisation, here it is.

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:48,250
It wasn't quite as incredible as I had imagined, you know, it also took a really long time

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,490
to like, at least 30 minutes to calculate these right.

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:58,410
One of the things that I discovered is that for different images like, you need different

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,649
settings to really kind of capture what I would perceive as the dominant colour, which

00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:10,990
kind of makes sense, right, the way we perceive things, we abstract things, summarise things,

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:18,130
dominant colour is largely a matter of perception, but I considered this to be the completion

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,470
of a successful side project, you know.

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,380
I moved on to other things.

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,930
Then I got asked to write a book chapter, I was like, oh well, I guess I wrote this

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,870
algorithm, so I could write a book chapter.

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,089
So I made it into a little photograph, Ited all of this in processing, by the way, whilst

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,550
doing that I tried to put it online.

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,579
I used processing Java, not processing JavaScript, I'm sorry, I know it's a JavaScript conference.

00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:53,220
As I started trying to put this online, I started trying to run into things, I didn't

00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:01,279
want to deal - cross site describing permissions and stuff, at some point on this journey,

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,500
I remembered I'm an expert mobile developer, I was like Cate Huston why are you building

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:15,980
a mediocre desktop only app, clearly it should be a web app, I started working, it got a

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:23,860
working prototype, I ran into terrible performance problems, then I ended up creating a library

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:33,040
for testing, for generating and comparing images on iOS, I ended up - you heard that

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,110
correctly, I optimised it for space and Time Out side of the context of a technical interview,

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,810
it does occasionally happen.

00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:50,240
The app is called show and hide, it will be out pretty soon, I located to the UK, quit

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,740
the job I hated and started working for myself, this kind of remains my side project, the

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,860
definition of side project is the things you do for love not money.

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,029
Let's go back to that list.

00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,560
Because now I had control.

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,509
Sometimes too much control, but like I definitely have control.

00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:16,540
Reward, people started to appreciate my work.

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,860
It was tied to other things I did at the same time but till you know, I got much more positive

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,210
feedback from the community than I ever did from that terrible manager.

00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:32,661
Community, I had editors and support on the book chapter, I work with a designer and a

00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:35,279
branding person.

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:42,240
Fairness, proceeds from the book go to charity, indie apps don't really make money I am excited

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:51,410
to get same share of nothing as everyone else {laughter} values so the kind of project I

00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,410
burnt out on

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:59,390
it was like an enormous yak shaving project, I did shave a lot of yaks in this process,

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,459
but everyone of them filled a need, I was able to share that outcome with other people.

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:09,610
So from this testing library I made, building a toolkit at workshop out of techniques I

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:16,540
used for doing really good test coverage on iOS, getting the processing time down from

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:23,779
round like 10 seconds to instant, you know, I solve actual problems not like made up engineer

00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:24,949
problems.

00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:33,199
There's an elephant in the room here and it's name is time.

00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:34,199
Right?

00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:41,019
We only have 24 hours in the day 168 hours in the week, some of us have a bunch of responsibilities

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:50,220
that others don't I am not going to tell you, you could make time if you try harder.

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,630
There's things like rescue time that can be honest with useful about how you are spending

00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:01,079
you time, I am not going to tell you to stop watching TV either, I am always baffled by

00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:07,550
the talks that say work all day, top watching TV, come home work all evening everything

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,980
will be fine.

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,290
{laughter} you know I have never been watching TV all evening, doesn't mean I don't have

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,050
unlimited hours to work right.

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,959
I also just don't think that's sustainable.

00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,130
I am going to make two suggestions.

00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:28,880
So firstly, are you doing stuff that you could just not do?

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:36,779
For me, as a woman working in tech I ended up doing a bunch of stuff that thank less

00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,580
emotional labour basically.

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:44,540
A lot of it was round trying to improve the representation of women.

00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:50,750
Ladies, we don't have to do this.

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:57,779
{applause} giving this up freed up a lot of time.

00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:03,220
I cannot even tell you because I think that stuff that you do is not generally valued

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,940
is a great place to start looking for things you can not do and free up time.

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:16,350
I get that you wouldn't do it if you didn't think it was important, like that was me too,

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:22,860
but you can make a choice to prioritise what makes you happier over what you think you

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,670
should be doing, but nobody else is going to.

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,360
We know that women leave tech at a much greater rate than men.

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,880
The best thing that any of us can do is be happy and fulfilled in our careers.

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,810
Secondly different kinds of time allow for different kinds of progress, and so if you

00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,220
use the time when you feel on top of your game really well, then you can set yourself

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,980
up to achieve things when you are feeling kind of meh.

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,490
If you have test that you need to write if you spec them out when you are really on top

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:07,180
of things you can write them later when you are feeling a bit like, life is hard.

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,500
Maybe even when you are watching TV offer boiler plate your code whenever you are half

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:18,009
asleep on a Saturday morning, kind of fix it, hook it up later in the day.

00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:24,190
I often start with something I consider to be a warm up task if I am not really feeling

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:30,000
like super productive and sometimes that then when I get done, sometimes it turns into a

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,839
little spiral and I build on it.

00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,490
The thought I want you to take away today is a question.

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,300
What if you expected more from your side projects and less from your job?

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:54,680
If our side projects, ooh, what does your human need?

00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,300
If our side projects involve other people, how can we give them what they need?

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,149
It's worth asking someone, what do you want to get out of this project because they might

00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:09,200
tell you, but we have this handy list we can refer back and to see if we're maybe meeting

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,060
people's needs on that.

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,890
So control.

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:19,570
Control is super easy if you just own something, but I think control is being able to influence

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,100
the outcome.

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,259
You don't have to be in

00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:25,250
charge, you just need to feel like you can make a difference.

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,870
If we want to give people control we have to give up a little bit ourselves and we have

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,139
to trust them and this is really hard, right?

00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:38,339
We have to accept a little bit of chaos.

00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:44,740
Reward, there's this book called the 5 Love Languages which seems like a bizarre thing

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,940
to mention in this context, it's the best book I found that understands that different

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,459
people appreciate different kinds of appreciation.

00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,570
One of them is touch and just ignore that one, touch is never an appropriate way to

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,040
reward someone in a professional context.

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,630
{laughter} The other ones are words, you can tell people they did it great job.

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:16,200
Gifts, now these don't have to be big, you know like oh I found this e-book that I thought

00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,160
you might like.

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,190
Time, you know, mentoring people.

00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:26,850
Acts of service, and again this can be really small like you are you are co-working you

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,980
make a point to make them a cup of tea.

00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,310
Reward is what makes people feel like their contribution is appreciated.

00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,810
Whatever that is.

00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,220
Community connection to other humans.

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,550
I think it's worth building healthy communities on its own account, but let's just set that

00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:54,050
aside for a moment because people will bond together over a common enemy, this a short-term

00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,620
and not a long-term strategy.

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,380
One thing we're seeing in open source right now, is some projects are really investing

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,380
in their communities.

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,680
They are ramping up newbies, adding codes of conduct, and we see others doubling down

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,760
on this fantasy of a meritocracy.

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,270
We will see in the long-term.

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:22,400
Fairness treating people equitably, can you be transparent so it's clear what been rewarded

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
and why.

00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,270
Can you work to remove bias.

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,540
Because we know in this industry that we have a problem with the way that we treat women

00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,760
and the way that we treat minorities.

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,690
We get this shit at work, I got called the C word by a colleague amongst other things,

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,850
and it was horrible, but I put up with this stuff day today because they paid me really

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,530
well to do that.

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,530
Because I was on a work permit.

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,180
I don't want to put up with this stuff in the things that I do in my free time, I don't

00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,180
think I am alone there.

00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,810
This is part of being fair, and this is part of being a good community.

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,110
Values.

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:12,970
If your project is values based you can community them and bring values back to them I have

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,080
some examples.

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,650
First call request project it's to help people make their first contribution to open source

00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:26,910
software so control it makes contributing to open source impossible.

00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:32,290
Reward, you get to be someone who has contributed to open source.

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,770
Community, it's designed to support you as you do that.

00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:41,380
Fairness, it's about making open source more accessible to people who historically have

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:47,400
been left out and values, this open source software, this idea that we all use it, we

00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,510
should all get back to it.

00:19:49,510 --> 00:20:00,990
Model view culture, it's a critique focused on tech They solicit contributions for the

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,660
community and people write for it.

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,070
Control, you decide what you write about.

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,930
Rewards, they actually pay writers which is it's very rare to get paid for you writing

00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,400
so I feel like for me it's always been that I got paid to write rather than how much money

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,410
I made from it.

00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,560
Community.

00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,210
This publication is a contribution to the community that cares about inclusivity in

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,680
tech and fairness.

00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:34,810
This is the whole aim of social justice, right, regardless of whatever game are spouting now.

00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:42,280
You see in every issue in every article.

00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,380
Their final example is technically speaking it's an newsletter that a friend and I

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,410
run we try to encourage people in there public speaking.

00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:58,500
So our goal or pitch is like we're like the mentor that shows up in your in box every

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,420
week saying you have something to say, and here is some resources that might be helpful.

00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:11,620
Control, it's all about making things seem more possible, kind of demystifying things.

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,760
Reward, you know, maybe you get to come somewhere like this right and share whatever it is that

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,770
you have been excited about on stage.

00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,810
You get to be a public speaker.

00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:29,630
Community, so we run webinars most months, we engage with people on Twitter, we take

00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,510
questions find the resources that they need.

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,960
Fairness.

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,620
So part of this is about demystifying this process and this idea you don't need to be

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,230
chosen that you can put yourself forward.

00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,450
We highlight things like travel costs because we think that transparency there makes things

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,980
fairer.

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,040
Values, this is the last one but it's a really big one fours.

00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:58,060
Like I said we think conferences should cover travel costs, we weigh that in what CFPs we

00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,370
include, we also believe in inclusive events.

00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,580
We will only share things with a code of conduct.

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,990
I am not going to pretend that a code of conduct is a high bar of inclusivity it's a new minimum

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,750
it's pretty telling when events don't have one.

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,680
More broadly than that we curate this vision of the tech industry that we wish we saw,

00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,330
we share at least 50% content from women we actively look for other under-represented

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,300
groups to highlight and include.

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,160
So if you are feeling a little burnt out I want to leave you with the question I asked

00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
earlier.

00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,800
What if you expected more from your side projects and less from your job?

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,000
More broadly I want to ask what if we as a community as asked more from our side projects

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,310
and less from our jobs.

00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:53,380
I am really happy that I got to share this talk at JSConfEU I know yarn and Tiffany and

00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,890
the other organisers work super hard to make it that kind of space so thank you so much

00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,890
for having me.

00:22:59,890 --> 00:22:59,891
