Title: Alejandro Oviedro: A fifth of century | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-09
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	This last May JavaScript turned 20 years old. I want to look at how we are used to code with the current standard (ES5) and how it would be to use JavaScript’s first version in retrospective. We’re going to talk about the path through Mocha, LiveScript, JavaScript, ECMAScript 1, 2,3,5 and the latest ECMAScript 2015 and 2016.
