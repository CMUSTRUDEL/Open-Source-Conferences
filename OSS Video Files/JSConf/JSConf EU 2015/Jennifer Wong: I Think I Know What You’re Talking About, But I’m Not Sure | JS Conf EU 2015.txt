Title: Jennifer Wong: I Think I Know What You’re Talking About, But I’m Not Sure | JS Conf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-14
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	Recursion, instantiate, lexical scope - where do these words come from?! If you’ve ever been in conversation with other developers and thought, “I think I know what they’re talking about, but I’m not sure…”, you’re not alone. Let’s delve into the weird and wonderful parlance that computer scientists and developers have created for themselves. Whether the words are borrowed or just plain made up, I’ll uncover how they made their way into the vocabulary of the modern programmer.

In this session, you’ll learn everything from etymology to history to broader definitions, all of which can help you understand what the heck that person’s rambling about. So, the next time you’re in conversation, you’ll be the one discussing dependency injection versus inversion of control with ease.

Guten morgen JS Conf EU

00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,540
So today as an ?? said that I'm going to talk about things that I think I know

00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,780
what you're talking about but I'm not quite sure so I'm Jenn I'm a front-end

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:45,720
developer I am currently a software or software engineer at Eventbrite as an

00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,180
extent and you may know me the creator of human waste land also known as the

00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:57,850
poop map particularly those view from the bay area you may also know me as the

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,510
creator of developers developers which is a project I recently created a

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:09,500
dedication to Mr Steve Ballmer but all of that is just a long winded way of

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,750
saying that I write code for a living before we get started them quick

00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:23,289
disclaimers there are going to be a lot of animated gifs in the talk and there

00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:26,290
may be a few errors

00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,470
if you notice any of those errors before you start to feel a little bit like this

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:40,770
or a little bit like this

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:53,420
let's talk about it becoming finally after I talk let's go as i said im a

00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:00,130
developer software engineer programmer or whatever else you might want to call

00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:08,850
me so some days and I look at my computer this is how I feel and I'm

00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,600
pretty sure many of you can relate to that feeling and sometimes when I'm in

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,680
conversation with other developers I feel like this

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:28,750
so Phil Karlson once there are two of only two hard things in computer science

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:35,599
cache invalidation and naming things and we can see that in the many various

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,109
complicated terms in computer science and web development so here is just a

00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:45,209
general sampling of some of the words I've come across in my career as a

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,700
programmer and oftentimes I hear them and I'm like their little bit familiar I

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,760
think I know what you're talking about but not really sure and so in those

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,840
conversations I often ask people can you explain that word me and in doing so I

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,830
get a look like this

00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:14,920
and when I get that looks from other people it makes you feel like this again

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,350
these were the very complicated they have very checkered past they have very

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,920
interesting history they come from all different places and so today I'm gonna

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,640
go over a few of those terms so when you hear them in conversation

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,410
perhaps you feel a little bit less like this and you feel a little bit more like

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,050
this

00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:45,330
right the first step is for a murder versus argument what's the difference is

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:51,500
there 10 to find out I of course went to Google and when i search parameter

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,320
argument you'll see many people are wondering about the difference between

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,380
the two

00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,480
because you can see it the third period down that's auto fills so here I have

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,900
written a function it's called shark and I call sharp at the very bottom with the

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:16,330
string left so how many people in the audience think that the perimeter is

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:24,010
that first in that first line plot fired raise your hand and how many people

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,350
think it is a string left in the bottom line of this code raise your hand and

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,240
obviously everything and both times you guys don't know

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,340
alright well I'm not going to tell you but I'm going to keep going so forever

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,370
and online etymology dictionary and etymology is essentially the history of

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,770
worth said that her amateur is a measurable factor which helps to define

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:54,190
a particular system and when I read that I'm like ok I think I know which one is

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,410
the primary now but I keep going and when i search argument on the online

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,150
etymology dictionary I find that there's just information about people arguing

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,789
with each other and Michael that doesn't explain to you what an argument is so

00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:14,650
you keep going and I check out computer programming on Wikipedia and here I see

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,800
that the term parameter sometimes called the formal parameter is often used to

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,090
refer to the variable as found in the function definition

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,690
argument sometimes called the actual parameter refers to the actual input

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:35,780
pass because I'm a developer this definition makes sense to me but I

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,590
wonder why don't we stick with the terms formal parameter and actual parameter

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,889
and find that out

00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:50,300
we've gotta go down the rabbit hole so I look at mathematics I've search

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,370
parameter an argument and mathematics on Wikipedia and I find that a function

00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,490
definition can also contain parameters but unlike variables parameters are not

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:06,009
listed among the argument that the function takes like what does that mean

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:13,750
Wikipedia like please go on so we hear that the variable X designates the

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,509
functions argument but AV and he are the parameters so I look at this quadratic

00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:27,430
function and I see that x is the argument and ab&c other parameters and

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,659
they wait wait a second so I have a math function up on top and we see that aids

00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,900
the parameter then I have a computer science

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:42,759
for a function JavaScript and I see that bars the parameter like whoa that's

00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:50,729
totally messing me up right now so the way I explained it is that this Bulldog

00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:59,039
as a parameter computer science is the football and so as soon as a programmer

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:11,560
computer science its definition just gets foot completely on it

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:19,900
help define a function and arguments are passed into a function but that's only

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:26,520
in computer science so here's our answer the parameters up on top and shark in

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,030
the function definition and then the argument is down at the bottom that

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:36,530
string left in the function call and all that being said we just used for a

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:42,230
better argument interchangeably anyways so that was easy right

00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:50,970
alright next up is scope so I don't know about all of you but when somebody asks

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,250
me to talk about scope I don't want to talk about scope please don't make me

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:04,600
talk about go but I'm going to talk about it today the first up is lexical

00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,600
scoping and of course they go back to Google and I see that lexical scoping

00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,290
parentheses sometimes known as static scoping is a convention used with many

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:20,229
programming languages that such the scope or range of functionality of a

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:24,950
variable so that it may be only be called for reference from within the

00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:32,440
block of code in which it is defined

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,840
that definition has three different equivalent definitions just within it so

00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,860
they say that lexical scoping is equivalent to static scoping scope is

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,680
related to or its equivalent to range of functionality and called is equivalent

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,090
to reference were stopped what supports the ball is actually used the term scope

00:08:53,090 --> 00:09:01,260
in the definition of lexical scoping study break it down a little bit in the

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:08,500
online etymology dictionary is a name purpose object being aimed at mark or

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,920
target and I really explain it in computer science 30 let's keep going to

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,250
search scope on Wikipedia and I feel that a scope is a part of a program that

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:27,330
is or can be the scope for a set of bindings a precise definition is tricky

00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:33,600
see below

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:41,360
okay thanks alot Wikipedia I gotta see below the pillow I see that in computer

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,940
programming the scope of a name by ending an association of a name to an

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,240
entity such as a variable is the part of a computer program where the binding is

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
valid

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,730
where the name can be used to refer to the entity and Mike whoa that make sense

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,370
to me because I know what scope is already but somebody who's new to

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,329
programming may come and read this and be like I don't really know what youre

00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:12,089
talking about and so when I read this I'm like oh ok definition so you keep

00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,329
going

00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:18,519
same article on scope and Wikipedia and then they say the strict definition of

00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,060
lexical scope of a name or identifiers is unambiguous thanks a lot Wikipedia

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:31,259
you're so condescending unambiguous but it says that it is quote the portion of

00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:38,079
source code in which a binding of a name with an entity applies ok that makes

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,699
sense to me it's pretty short and sweet and I keep reading and I see that it has

00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:49,120
been virtually unchanged from its 1960 definition in the specification of algal

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,920
60 and I don't know about you all but when I saw Algol 60 was like I don't

00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,149
know what that is so I'll bill sixties short for algorithmic language of 1960

00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,699
and I'll go sixty was a first language implementing nested function definitions

00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:11,279
with lexical scope and I think wait so we've had the definition of what local

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:19,600
scope since 1960 and it's still so hard to explain to other people but

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,810
moving on let's talk about lexical vs dynamics go to lexical scope is the main

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,690
focus of that Wikipedia article with dynamic scope understood by contrast

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,949
with lexical scope sorry this and I'm like really like I have to know what

00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:43,340
lexical scope is first before you can even define dynamics go for me

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:50,430
all right let's get a little bit deeper the lexical on the online etymology

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:59,290
dictionary means pertaining to words like ok what about dynamic and dynamic

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,440
means pertaining to force producing motion or the opposite of static and I

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,820
was like oh that's pretty interesting because I first definition of lexical

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:14,620
scoping on google said that lexical scoping is also static scoping so you

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:21,210
keep going and look up more about scope on Wikipedia again and for most

00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,240
programming languages part of a program refers to a portion of the source code

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,840
or area of texts and is known as lexical scope oh ok that's where pretending the

00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,410
words comes from and then in some languages however part of a program

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:42,480
refers to the quote portion of run time or time period during execution and

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,300
that's known as dynamic scope and then I keep reading below and I see both of

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:54,930
these terms are somewhat misleading and I keep reading they misused technical

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:01,310
terms as discussed in the definition or so what I just read it wrong and then I

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,460
keep reading that says but the distinction itself is accurate and

00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,320
precise and these are the standard respective terms like oh I thought I

00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:16,400
just rode with right ok so I keep reading again of course and we feel that

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,030
in practice with luck local scope of variables definition is result by

00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,490
searching its containing block or function then if that fails searching

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,260
the outer containing block and so on

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,730
whereas with dynamic scope the calling function as search then the function

00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:39,450
which called that calling function and so on and i go that's pretty clear I

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,670
think that makes sense to me so all that being said this is a javascript

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,470
conference who cares about that

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:55,150
amex go the way I like to think about lexical scope is the box as a function

00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:00,490
the orange cat it's a variable in that function

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:13,190
cat can see the white cat but the white cat can see the orange cat

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:33,810
ok running back or to run back kind of makes sense but not quite related to

00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:39,710
computers so I look for corrosion on Wikipedia and I read that the most

00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,400
common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science in

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,880
which it refers to a method of defining functions in which the function being

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,580
defined is applied within its own definition wait I thought this was a

00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,110
definition why is redefining so many different definitions within its

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:05,410
definition so I keep reading and I think that this is likely this defines an

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:11,950
infinite number of instances or function values using a finite expression that

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,880
for some instances may refer to other instances and in such a way that no lube

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:24,070
or infinite chain of references can occur

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:32,040
let's keep going I keep reading down this article and I see that in

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,530
mathematics and computer science class of objects or method exhibit recursive

00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:41,420
behavior when they can be defined by two properties number one a simple base case

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,480
or cases it terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,620
answer and number two is that a rule that reduce all of their cases toward

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,530
that base case and again kinda makes sense to me because I am a developer

00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:00,100
before somebody who's new they probably are gonna give me a look like this when

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:07,330
they read that so at a pace I like to describe recursion a function that calls

00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:13,600
itself that's what I would like to see on Wikipedia so often times he will

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,900
explain recursion to other people by saying this and then they decide to get

00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,220
a little bit more complicated and talk about the Fibonacci sequence and I'm

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,100
like oh god I took math lake over a decade ago I don't know about you but I

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,370
see this and I'm like I don't even remember what the Fibonacci sequence is

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,420
so when somebody starts to explain or corrosion to me by talking about food

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:43,130
not cheesy friends I'm whatever one time though a friend explained to me

00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:49,540
recursion by talk about pictorials I think everybody really likes factorial

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,460
because they have this cute little exclamation point and if you remember

00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,640
them more like elementary or middle school mathematics like that makes a lot

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,980
more sense and I really like that definition of recursion so when somebody

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,910
talks about that I feel a lot more like this a good example

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,110
alright next incarnation so concatenation on the online etymology

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:23,189
dictionary refers to a linking together to link together a chain like well we

00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:29,070
actually use that word correctly in computer science go up there really any

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:34,480
reason I want to bring up this word of God cabinet and this is my cat

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:44,140
everything better concat and here's the recursive cat

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:54,730
infinitely function ok anyway it next evidence and she ate there once and she

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:00,730
ate from the online etymology dictionary it comes from instant and it was created

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:06,370
in 1946 and my god that's pretty recent actually and then I go to Google and I

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:12,220
my brother's intervention and it mean to represent as or by an instant and their

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,160
example is a study of two groups who seem to instantiate productive aspects

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,480
of this this what

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,720
as if this wasn't confusing enough in javascript

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,270
Wikipedia when I 3:30 and financial issue and i actually come across

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:39,539
philosophy and it says that in predicate logic universal instantiation also known

00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:47,100
as you also called universal specification or universal elimination

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,679
and sometimes confused with dictum the Army is it held rule of inference from a

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,220
truth about each member of a class of individuals to the truth about a

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,280
particular individual of that class flick that kind of makes sense but

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:11,440
basically all catherine hammill rise a cat and therefore fries animal that's

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,909
universal universal instantiation in philosophy so here I have a class that

00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:25,049
have created called mammal and a class that I've called cat and I thought the

00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:32,559
caps prototype 2 mammal and instantiate a new cat here called Frank at so

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,309
basically fried pork at all cats are mammal and therefore frank at is also a

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:46,039
minimal like cool another good thing that we have correct in computers like

00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:53,159
intention but weirdly the online etymology dictionary instantiation

00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,760
actually redirects to instantiate and on Wikipedia and shit redirects to

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,270
negotiation so we only have either the noun form or the verb form you can't

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:14,270
have both apparently moving onto acronym here are some acronym I always get

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:24,150
confused CRM and media and just to go over them again very confusing CRM is a

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:31,700
Customer Relationship Manager kind of like Salesforce a CMS content management

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:40,299
kind of like WordPress and a CD and is a content delivery network kind of like

00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:49,700
Amazon CloudFront next versus when you're talking about that please clarify

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,870
to me which one you are talking about are you talking about software as a

00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,389
service like Salesforce are you talking about think tactically awesome style

00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:02,720
sheets which is the CSS extension language I don't know but if you don't

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,279
tell me that I'm gonna get back to you about it next to the DOM

00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:14,929
there are many kinds of Dom this is great for da which is a chapel in

00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:24,219
Austria this is Dom the indie rock band and they feed on which is a mountain

00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:31,220
located in the out and again we feel that word

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:37,919
but there are many kinds of Dom but the damn that we're interested in is the

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,240
Document Object Model wikipedia says that the DOM is a cross-platform in

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,850
language independent convention for representing and interacting with

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:53,799
objects in HTML HTML and XML document kind of makes sense to me let's keep

00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:58,169
hoping for another definition so I searched Mozilla developers network and

00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:02,860
I feel that the DOM is a programming interface for HTML XML in a 3G document

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:08,630
it provides a structure representation of the document a tree and it defines

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,299
the way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can

00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,120
change the document structure style and content

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,809
go okay maybe a little bit more sense to me thank them the best of all they

00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:27,419
actually have an illustration of the tree oh my god that's what it looks like

00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:37,730
cool right next is GUI and CLI so I like he'll likely because if we call it GUI

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:45,539
why can't we call it clean it when I hear weekly butter cake and then I just

00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,810
can't work anymore

00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:52,890
I also think about greed I'm not sure if you all know what that is but it's

00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:59,180
basically a weird bivalve in the ocean it's also edible kind of PC little

00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:05,220
things but strangely this is actually are useful gooey duck kind of

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:11,580
counterintuitive and then when I read Li I read it as clear again and that makes

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:19,680
me think about Paul Klee the painter but most of us I think really know that

00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,560
gooey are graphical user interfaces and they were first introduced in reaction

00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,430
to the perceived steep learning curve of command line interfaces or please as I

00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:36,340
like to call them which require command to be typed on the keyboard and lastly I

00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:42,440
have Ajax I love the word a jack but it's really outdated because to even use

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:50,110
of XML I also found recently that date the jQuery AJAX method has an option to

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:57,250
set a thing to false that means that you can actually be running as judge

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:09,160
alright in conclusion to hear these terms like I have no idea what you're

00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,440
talking about and as soon as you understand it you just get it because

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,020
you just get it it makes it really hard to explain those terms to somebody else

00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,800
you kind of have to wait for them to nudge them until just hits so I know

00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,730
it's really difficult to explain other people but I implore you when somebody

00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:38,450
asks you to explain a term China this year like this we're trying to pass the

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:43,670
buck to make somebody else to explain it because you don't feel like it and try

00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:54,950
to preview a little bit more like this it's so hard to understand and let's

00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,270
watch this video so we see here

00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:05,900
number 12 has just fallen on the ice and she was like I don't understand what

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,800
good is

00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,020
everyone around me is talking about GUI they're all talking about going and I

00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:18,950
don't know what it means another number 12 is like let me help you I would

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:27,340
explain GUI tu guey it's just the graphical user interface and other never

00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:42,110
told us like I understand thank you

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:53,010
number 12 then we can party together in the computer science jargon land thanks

00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:53,360
