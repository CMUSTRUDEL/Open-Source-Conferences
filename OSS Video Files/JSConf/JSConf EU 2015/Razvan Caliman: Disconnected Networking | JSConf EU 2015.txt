Title: Razvan Caliman: Disconnected Networking | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-11
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	There was a time when data connections like WiFi and Bluetooth didn’t exist, yet people still managed to send information over long distances using clever encodings like Morse Code, sound waves and visual impulses.

What can we learn from that?

This talk looks at ways to use web platform capabilities, like the Web Audio API, Ambient Light Events and Touch Events, to revisit old data transmission techniques and apply them in new contexts. We’ll use demos to explore ultrasonic networking between air-gapped devices, indoor positioning without GPS and sending data through touch.

Finally, we’ll look at the privacy implications these unconventional networking capabilities bring.
