	00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,340
it's my first time here and it's just

00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,710
the the best combination of like green

00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,920
and big city and great public

00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,810
transportation and cool bars and

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,540
actually really excellent food so

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,610
obviously the the best way to get to a

00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,440
conference is to speak at it and I would

00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,660
encourage pretty much anyone who even

00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,420
thinks they have an idea to a submitter

00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,040
a CFP you know it's just a great

00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,110
opportunity to meet like the coolest

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,720
people doing the coolest programming

00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,580
language and I don't think there's a way

00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,090
you could regret it it's just been you

00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:51,070
know nothing but fun and learning and a

00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,030
you know community that that sense of

00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,030
like we're all in this together

00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:13,790
really enjoy about jas kana it's

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,620
fantastic all the speakers are great got

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,240
a lot of friends who also came here so

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,340
just like people i know from from other

00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,860
conferences and other other states other

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,430
countries it's it's a it's a great

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,200
gathering spot I think really fun my

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,900
biggest takeaway is probably that the

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,870
community is so massive and so large and

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,280
so friendly still there's so many people

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,360
to meet but everyone's really

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,180
approachable everyone's really friendly

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,160
no one feels like oh I've been here

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,650
before so I'm veteran I don't need to

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,080
talk to the new people there they really

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,250
feel like they'll guide you along if you

00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,840
don't know what you're doing or they'll

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,880
sit down and talk with you and discuss

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,820
any type of topic that you're really

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,459
interested in um I love everything about

00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,860
the conference so my first time here was

00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:00,500
actually last year one of I got at

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,510
Pickett's it was sponsored by Google

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,569
because they were trying to support more

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,269
women in tech and I love the community

00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:10,549
here I love the warm welcome that I got

00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:12,829
I love that people helped me out to

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,720

00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:16,850
