Title: Pawel Szymczykowski: JavaScript in (Near) Space | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-09
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	Near space is a region of the Earth’s atmosphere starting at 20 km, high enough to boil water at body temperature. With a little bit of preparation, you can launch a ballon carrying a payload of sensors and cameras driven by JavaScript into near space at twice the height that commercial airlines can fly. I will guide you through the hardware, software and red tape you should be familiar with to create your own high altitude experiments. Let’s take back cloud computing!
