Title: Pawel Szymczykowski: JavaScript in (Near) Space | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-09
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	Near space is a region of the Earth’s atmosphere starting at 20 km, high enough to boil water at body temperature. With a little bit of preparation, you can launch a ballon carrying a payload of sensors and cameras driven by JavaScript into near space at twice the height that commercial airlines can fly. I will guide you through the hardware, software and red tape you should be familiar with to create your own high altitude experiments. Let’s take back cloud computing!

Hi, everyone, today I'm going to tell you about JavaScript in near space. It's actually

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,989
based on a project some friends of mine and I have been toddling around with for about

00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:46,070
a year. On and off. And I was just reminded that it's actually yesterday was the anniversary

00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:54,329
of the first balloon my friends attempted to launch, it actually met an untamely death

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:04,470
four feet off the ground on a stray beard hair, just FYI.Fully name is Pawel Szymczykowski.

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,670
If you're not familiar with the pronunciation of Polish names, I've provided a visual pronunciation

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:19,590
guide there for you. If you can say Paul bell ship check coffee ski, we'll call it close

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:31,069
enough (Applause) I'm from Las Vegas. I work for a small company called Wegi res that does

00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:36,500
on‑line pooling, I'm atmakenai on Twitter, but adopt follow me, don't tweet anything

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:45,330
interesting. If you've heard of me at all it's probably for this guy here it's Sumobot

00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:53,770
yup your, an Open Source design kit that I designed. It pucked up steam and started popping

00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:01,800
up at a bunch of Nodebots all over the world, and eventually movement used it for their

00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:08,780
build event last year to demonstrate windows 10 orneriest berry pie the which was cool

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:21,480
but weird ‑‑ Rasberri Pie. I cented to this book here JavaScript robotics, among

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,230
much dueler people than I am, some of who are here today. I did a chapter on delta robots.

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,780
It's kind of like on the cover there. So why space? Why indeed. For a lot of us the answer

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:43,330
is like yeah, Fuck yeah, space is awesome. But for others maybe I'll try to quantify

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:52,911
my reasoning. So space is just this sort of like vast endless thing that holds all of

00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:59,480
these mysterious secrets, literally like no place on this earth. And I think as a species

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:06,730
we just kind of yearn to explore the unknown, you know, it's space, it probably holds like

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:12,880
the mysteries to lay itself, who knows.  ‑‑ mysteries to life itself. I probably watched too much

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:24,320
Star Trek next generation as a kid. When office kid there wasn't a ton

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,290
of things going on, shuttles were pretty common and Ronald Reagan was trying to build massive

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:51,880
space weapon, not cool, TNG was can ‑‑ I don't know if you've seen a lot of these

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:58,030
before, the first one there is Nodebots, those are like the wheeled ones then node boats,

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:10,620
really popular at JSCofn in Florida. We have node powered submersibles, open ROV is a remotely

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:22,030
operated vehicle that you can power with a node web server. node Copters, I think it's

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:32,270
time for JavaScript in near space, more achievable than outer space. And finally, I think just

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,770
because it's a challenging and interesting problem, it's hard and there's a reason why

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:45,260
it's kind of the domain of countries and well funded private companies like space X or virgin

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,230
Galatic. This is a side project, on a totally different scale, still hard, it takes a lot

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:57,810
of different disciplines, lot of different areas, it includes electronics and programming

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:05,990
and building things and radio operations and like car chases and all sorts of things, a

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,880
lot of things can go wrong and they often do, and take a long time to figure out. But

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,630
that's what makes it interesting to work on. Yeah, that said, I do think it's definitely

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:28,040
a possible thing to do. As long as you've set realistic goals and pretty persistent.

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:35,090
Speaking of goals, let's figure out what those are, at least for me and my group. Step one,

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:40,930
kind of a no brainer so to get really high up in the air. There are a lot of things that

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:47,720
go up in the air, drones are one of them, they don't quite go high fluff to be interesting,

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,760
some of ‑‑ hey enough to be interesting, some of the commercial oneless, at least in

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,949
the United States, we're not allowed to fly them maybe higher than 120‑meters. There

00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:03,680
are industrial, not industrial, really, but like high‑end model rockets. I'm talking

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,320
about not the SD kits you can get in card board tubes but 20‑foot ones that have massive

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,070
homemade engines, shoot up and they go really far, they're not in the sky very long they

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:23,830
go really fast and tend to explode, so it's not really in my comfort zone. What about

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,919
balloons, turns out in the United States, sorry, I don't know about regulations in other

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,460
countries, I know there's a lot of different countries represented here, but in the United

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:44,490
States, we have a federal guide of regulations, including FAA guidelines and there's specifically

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:53,780
a section there about mer Moarded and unMoard for photography and science oexperiments,

00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:00,150
there's regulations but notary sufficient, pretty reasonable compared to things like

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,520
drones right now which are new and scary, high altitude balloons have been around since

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,520
the 1700, so they're kind of lax. They have things in there like don't launch your boo

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,710
line over city or near an airport, kind of a no brainer. Don't launch on a day with low

00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,889
visibility, so airplanes know where you're launching from, so they don't run into the

00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:29,180
thing. Not really a problem in Las Vegas, there's hardly ever Cloud in the sky, just

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,740
very dry and blue all the time. Things like don't trail anything for longer than fifty

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:46,610
feet from your, balloon. Make sure whatever's trailing with break less than 50‑pounds

00:07:46,610 --> 00:08:01,600
of force in case an airplane runs into it. You also have to alert the air traffic controller

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,651
about a two hour launch window where and when you intend to launch. Finally you have to

00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:13,900
have two ways of getting the balloon down, one of them went too high and it came down,

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:20,370
so that's kind of in the bag. Pretty reasonable. However, do they go high enough that we can

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:35,120
say that we've gone to space? In fact, ‑‑ in fact, yes. Wrong slide, sorry. So these

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,060
high altitude balloons or weather Baloos they're also called can go up to 37‑kilometers,

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:50,811
there's an area called near space starting at between 20 and 100‑kilometers. At that

00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:55,920
point you can start to see the curvature of the earth. It's really interesting, right

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,830
at that 20‑kilometers up, there's a zone known as Armstrong's limit. At which point

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:08,290
humans can't safely go up without a pressure suit, because the pressure is so low that

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:15,360
water will start to boil at body temperature. It's exactly what I'm looking for, something

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,080
alien, strange that you can't see hear, and it looks beautiful. By the way, it's not named

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:29,160
after Neil Armstrong the astronaut, another Armstrong, hairy Armstrong, an airforce doctor

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:39,121
who discovered this (Harry) so obviously the best thing to do would be if you could go

00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:44,601
up there yourself and experience it. But that would probably take a lot of balloons, and

00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:49,180
I don't is there a pressure suit or even like a pressed business suit. So that one's out

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,380
(Laughing) the next best thing might be to send up some sort of sensors and collect interesting

00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,220
data to see what it's like up there, poke around, essentially build a probe and experience

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:08,200
it. Have a sort of out of body experience, so that's what we'll do. And we'll use JavaScript

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,970
NY ‑‑ why JavaScript, A, it's a JavaScript conference, I wouldn't give the talk if it

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,510
wasn't JavaScript. A lot of it has to do with this piece of software here, Johnny‑Five.

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:30,370
It is a fantastic piece of software for controlling hardware using JavaScript. It's written by

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:37,230
a man named Rick Waldron. I credit it for me getting into JavaScript development at

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:47,170
all before that I was puddling along happily with Java and Ruby, and I thought, this is

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:56,940
what I'm going to do now. For a very long time, or pretty long time, I guess, Johnny‑Five

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:03,640
only worked with Arduinos, then one day, that's fine, but maybe not so good for application

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:10,339
here, you'd have to tether the Arduino to your laptop using like a USB cable and you

00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:16,100
probably don't want to launch that up into the air. (Laughing) but then, one day, I think

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,340
it was maybe two years ago or so, Johnny‑Five got support for plugble I/O module and could

00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:29,180
support any hardware anyone was willing to write a driver for. And then a man named brine

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:37,630
Hughs and wrote this Raspi‑IO package to support Johnny‑Five ton Rasberry pie, it

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:44,760
would run stand alone, you could do pretty much all the things you could to with Johnny‑Five,

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,850
but it was suddenly untethered and you could run it on this little computer. This is a

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,800
model, I believe it's an A plus, small, uses less power than some other ones, perfect for

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:03,510
the task. Oddly enough Brian Hubhs is next door is giving a talk on JavaScript community,

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:12,860
not robots but he's equally capable of both. If you've done any work with Arduino's or

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,709
Johnny‑Five before, you might B. especially if you poke around a little bit, you might

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:23,081
be familiar with sensors that hook up using maybe two leads, one is like a ground and

00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:31,540
one is a power. The sensor pictured here is an MPU 5060, it's actually6 access exceller

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,980
rheometer and gyroscope, so at the minimum if we were going to hook up in the traditional

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,579
way you would need six signal pin and a ground pin, but there's other sensors on here as

00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:47,700
well. That can quickly get out of hand if you wanted to add support for more things.

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,019
Luckily, this particular sensor and a lot of the more complicated sensors have an interface

00:12:53,019 --> 00:13:00,019
known as I squared C that only uses four pins, just the first four on that right side (I

00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:06,860
2C) and I 2C devises are addressable so you can chain them together and only use four

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:16,399
pins, very useful for this purpose. You don't need to know anything special to use I2C devices

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:24,610
using Johnny‑Five you declare them and set up a listener for data events. You don't have

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,110
to look up the I2C device address yourself as you normally would if you're home ruling

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:38,720
Johnny‑Five will look thaw for you. And once we get that data, we'll probably want

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,910
to store it someplace useful so we can look it up later and reference it as a lacy web

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:51,770
developer, I tend to want ‑‑ as a lay city web developer I want to use tools that

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:58,760
are already there (Lazy) you might be familiar W. it's actually a logging framework. That

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,470
supports different log levels you normally use it to logger reports and debug statements

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:10,810
from your Webapp. One interesting thing it supports is JSON logging, you just set that

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:17,160
flag of JSON to true and you get nice JSON objects that you can parse pretty easily later

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,501
on. And all we have in the bottom line there is an interval to every half second. Look

00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:31,160
at the status of the current data Blog we were setting and just log that. This is a

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,420
sample of what that might look like, this is from a drone test flight I did a couple

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:43,070
of weeks back, I believe, or maybe just, no, not that long ago. And so this is one line

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,820
that has all the data for the three sensors. Oh, the ones that I had chained up there were

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:54,529
a thermometer, sorry, a parameter for temperature and pressure data and electric come pus for

00:14:54,529 --> 00:15:04,130
heading and the exceller rheometer itself (Compas) it's simple and very science tiff

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:13,800
looking data logger, I guess. (Baramat rer) another piece of data we might want on there

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,550
is visuals. Using raspberry pie camera for this, this is kind of no brainer, it's very

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:26,760
light, it's very cheap, it's about maybe 30‑dollars US or something and there are modules for

00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:36,740
it as well, they just wrap the native modules on the Raspberry Pi Pi, ‑‑ time stamps

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,279
on the data and the pictures or video will be insink automatically because they're U.S.ing

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:53,839
the same clock. (Raspberry Pi) then step three is probably the hardest one, it's getting

00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:04,450
everything back safely. Because if you don't get your balloon back, you get a ten second

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:13,781
show as you watch your balloon float away forever. That goes up must come down (Your

00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:22,660
balloon) but it won't come down as softly as you'd like. That's something that has a

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:29,670
lot to do with planning. The trajectory of your your balloon will likely take depends

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:41,220
ton weather er, time of year and weight of the balloon, luckily the folks at HAB.org

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:49,350
high altitude balloon hub have created a calculator to make it a lot easier. Essentially you figure

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,980
out how much your payload weighs, payload is a fancy term for the box that's on the

00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:04,130
bottom of the balloon. How much you're trying to lift up. How large your your balloon. They're

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:11,569
latex Baloons, they're very thin. Which is why beard hair could pop it. Normally you

00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:18,149
wear gloves and they come in different sizes. But rather than selling them in diameters

00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:22,880
they sell them in weights, so that's just how much the balloon itself weighs. Still

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,600
applies that a 650‑gram balloon will hold more gas than 250 program. You can fill them

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,531
with helium or hydrogen. Hydrogen is more exblowtive, helium is less expensive and there's

00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:50,059
world shortage chose it because it's less explosive ‑‑ how much gas and how much

00:17:50,059 --> 00:18:04,320
lifting force, once you have the rate of acceleration and the ‑‑ you can put it into the bottom

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,269
boxes there and pinpoint starting point on the map and it'll graph out where it thinks

00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:16,519
your balloon will go, at which point it will explode in the sky, that's the red dot in

00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:23,259
the middle. You'll want to, before that day preplan where you launch your balloon where

00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:30,269
it end up hopefully not on top of a mountain or secret military base. Do that before you

00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:39,460
launch. Of course that's not foolproof because, I mean, it's kind of an educated guess weather

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,590
patterns change. It won't cover the case where a giant bird on ducts your balloon and it's

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:54,341
miles off course. An ideal would be to add a G.PS tracker (Your balloon) you still need

00:18:54,341 --> 00:19:07,549
to get the data to yourself, you're on the ground watching a Balloo float away. WiFi,

00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:18,830
RF modules don't really have the range (Wifi) it in fact has a specific protocol for this

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:26,779
called APRS. APRS is stands for something ‑‑ automatic package ‑‑ something ‑‑

00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:35,700
something, any way it tracks things and sends their positions over short wave radio signal.

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:42,140
It does this by short wave radio the Ham radios, usually the people who hang out in their basements

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,540
and they're talking to people and talking their signal off the iOSphers trying to figure

00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:56,010
out if they can get to Iceland from Idaho. Those guys. It does that by ‑‑ the APRS

00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:04,340
uses kind of a ‑‑ an encoding called AFSK, audio frequency shift keying that encodes

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:10,840
the data as ‑‑ if anybody's old enough to remember using a dial up modem ‑‑

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:19,769
that type of thing. And there's another protocol underneath that that's like TCPIP. It's called,

00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:25,850
I believe it's ‑‑ yeah, I don't remember the name of it exactly. There's a routeing

00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:33,019
protocol and then it sends bits of information. It could be theoretically possible to rewrite

00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:38,549
that. On top of ‑‑ in JavaScript using Johnny‑Five adding support for the GPS radio

00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:44,549
adding support for a transmitter module. It would take a bit of effort though. And there's

00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:50,220
already a really nice schematic an Open Source software we called track, we know it's made

00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:59,080
for Arduino, figured I'd add that and talk to it over serial to the raspberry pie so

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:05,369
we can still get location data from it. You'll notice there's a call sign there, because

00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:12,330
short wave, the APRS frequency is regulated, you do need a Ham license to operate on the

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:18,840
signal and to broadcast on it. So, my friends and I will just sort of cram for the technician

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:27,399
class radio exam and maybe a week or so cram and all passed. It wasn't hard, the exams

00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:32,409
are all available on‑line, but we walked away knowing really nothing useful about Ham

00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:39,799
radio and how to use it, but we had call signs and that's all we really needed. And the way

00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:48,159
this APRS works it broadcasts this blip out on this frequency. And it arrives at a special

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,050
type of station, these stations are all over, called digital repeaters, they will listen

00:21:53,050 --> 00:22:02,450
for things that are addressed to APRS. There's a sample packet there below. KG 7 OXY my call

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:09,879
sign, these digital repeaters will route it through the internet where a servicelike APRS.FI

00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:15,330
will pick it up and plot it on a map. This is the area around my home in Vegas, the dots

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:23,509
are stations moving cars or I don't think there's balloons, some repeaters on there

00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:31,360
as well. If you have that and internet signal you can launch your your Balloon, grab some

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:41,779
hiking boots and go to where you think it is and hike the rest of the way. And then

00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:52,440
goal number 4 is actually doing it. (Laughing) so that's the tough part, like a lot of things

00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,700
that are involved space are usually behind schedule and over budget, and this one is

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:04,550
no exception. We haven't successfully launched this thing yet. But we're working on it. This

00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,610
is what the completed payload looks like. It's got all of the senators there, the raspberry

00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:19,179
pie, the raspberry pie camera, the track Adr oaryno, the Open Source kit and there's the

00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:24,630
antenna and the USB power thing right there. This is almost a complete. There's some issues

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:31,600
still with talking between the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino. A little bit of conversation

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:40,299
about that with brine yesterday. And there's also the worry about the antenna reaching

00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:52,330
digital repeaters, which it's high enough we'll see. It's good to test how the things

00:23:52,330 --> 00:24:00,539
will hold up. Once they're up there especially as far as the radio, it's a good way of testing

00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:06,840
it. We're still working on this, the next launch window we're looking at. This is like

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,999
weekends, a lot of us, actually one of us lives in a different city now, we all work

00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:18,159
in different places, but we're looking at October 23rd for the next one. So, let's

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:26,909
see how it goes, there might be a sequel to this talk at Thunderplains JS where hopefully

00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:33,119
there'll be a section about well what do you do with all that data once you have it. Maybe

00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:39,671
see Thunderplains. And that's all I have, thank you, these are my friends working on

00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:40,671
this with me. (Applause) and I have Nasa JS and ECMA stickers, if you'd like one of those,

00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:40,687
