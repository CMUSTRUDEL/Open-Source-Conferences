Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	As data scale increases and browser capabilities grow, it’s becoming increasingly possible to build rich, interactive visualisations on the web. Join us as we explore some of our powerful browser-based analytic tools designed to visualise time-series data and network graphs. In this session we’ll talk about how to use the DOM, Canvas and some smart Javascript tricks to build interactive user experiences designed to scale with the data.
