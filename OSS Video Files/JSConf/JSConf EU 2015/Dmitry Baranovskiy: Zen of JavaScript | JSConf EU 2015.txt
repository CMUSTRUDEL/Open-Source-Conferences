Publication date: 2015-11-09
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	Long time passed since JavaScript become mainstream. And despite multiple attempts, there is still no right single way to write code in this language. Everybody is using it in their own special way and most people still fill that they are failing to tame the language.

In this talk I will try to show you what language is trying to tell us for all these years, where is real path to enlightenment or at least we could have fun and look at things we know (or pretending to ;) from unorthodox point of view. ;)

Prepare to meet JavaScriptâ€¦ again.
