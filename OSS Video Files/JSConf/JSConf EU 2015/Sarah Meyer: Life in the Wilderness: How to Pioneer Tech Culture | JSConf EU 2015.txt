Description: 
	A lot of us are engineers at companies that don’t enshrine technology as their core product, or that employ significantly more non-technical than technical people. Others of us work completely alone as freelancers. If you’re in that position, how do you create a place for technological transformation in the organization, or communicate with non-technical clients?

I’ll cover how to - evaluate what your project needs - maintain your productivity - create understanding of technical issues - keep learning without anyone around to teach you new stuff.
