Title: Sarah Meyer: Life in the Wilderness: How to Pioneer Tech Culture | JSConf EU 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-13
Playlist: JSConf EU 2015
Description: 
	A lot of us are engineers at companies that don’t enshrine technology as their core product, or that employ significantly more non-technical than technical people. Others of us work completely alone as freelancers. If you’re in that position, how do you create a place for technological transformation in the organization, or communicate with non-technical clients?

I’ll cover how to - evaluate what your project needs - maintain your productivity - create understanding of technical issues - keep learning without anyone around to teach you new stuff.

My name is Sarah Meyer, and I am a web developer from New York, specifically

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,980
Brooklyn, home of -- yeah, home of the world's finest

00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:41,440
JavaScript meet-up, the very famous Brooklyn JS, not

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,930
to knock the other JS.

00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,790
Here we go.

00:00:48,790 --> 00:01:03,390
So my computer is ... Uh-huh ... Okay.

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,660
You know, you would expect a lot of things when you're about to do a talk.

00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,000
The last thing you expect is your computer to just shut down

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,280
on you.

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:24,710
But these things happen.

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,710
And okay.

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,710
Yay!

00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,710
All right.

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,710
applause].

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,710
All right, right back to it.

00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,759
So, I'm going to talk basically about being the only engineer

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,770
in a non-technical organisation, and, you know,

00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,360
this could because you're a consultant working with a

00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,220
company that has no technical expertise, or it could because

00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,709
you're the only engineer on salary at a company that

00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:49,039
maybe has like outsource developers.

00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,379
And I'm just going to explain a little bit about how I came to that

00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,160
position and what I did with it.

00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:01,420
So yet again, I'm Sarah Saltic-Meyer, hit me up on Twitter: Meyerini.

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,920
And I started out at a tech company where more

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,760
than 50 per cent of the staff were software engineers.

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,530
And you know, we were a pretty cool.

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,209
Web development company in 2013, so we were on that backbone

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:26,570
in rails, you know, Ts all about the monolithic MVC

00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,999
single page app, and, you know, that's where I sort of

00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,510
grew up as an engineer.

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:39,459
That's where I learned best practices and where I, you know, kind of absorbed what software

00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,019
engineering was, which was like constant refactoring.

00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,549
You know, always pushing for technical excellent, well

00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:47,170
tested code.

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,780
All the good things that we come and talk about at conferences like this, and it was

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,730
a particular kind of culture, like video games.

00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,489
We didn't work at all on the day when Apple would do a developer

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,219
conference, because there are things that are more

00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:06,019
important in life, and I loved it there.

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,099
That was a company in Boston, and I really wanted to

00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:13,329
go back to New York, which is where I grew up.

00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:19,170
So I did that, sort of ran away, you know, took a job for the

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,049
sake of taking a job, which was, you know, kind of a terrible

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,659
idea in a sense because I almost immediately got coached

00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:33,870
by the company of my dreams, I felt really connected

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,209
to the product, not so much a technical product,

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,530
but just having the opportunity to work on it.

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,860
I couldn't turn it down, didn't turn it down.

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,510
So in this non-technical organisation there was suddenly one technical

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,030
person and that was me.

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:57,079
So, you know, what did I do there, and what do you do there?

00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,859
It was another single page app this time because it was 2014 where were on

00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:07,319
to angular, and we had -- it was an e-commerce that had

00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,819
a big loading spinner every time you got there,

00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,370
and I hated that.

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,620
I thought there was so much to be done to improve

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,519
it, and so I wanted us to move to service side rendering

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,190
of our pages, I wanted us to get away from angular and

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,870
rendering and that was one of my first things, looking

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:39,270
through the app, figuring out what test coverage was

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,220
necessary, and what -- you know, if there were better

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,150
ways that we could be rendering our templates, like

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,830
anything that was in Hamil C, maybe, should have been in

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,699
Hamil.

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,850
A lot of what I did there, because it was a non-technical organisation again, we had

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,539
print designers doing our web design, which resulted

00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:09,470
in some very beautiful pages, but if you have ever

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,889
fought the battle of -- well, the mobile design looks

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,099
like things as you have elements A, B and C, and then

00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:22,271
on the desktop designs it is elements C, B and A, then you

00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,490
know of my struggle at this company.

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,449
(Laughter) . It was a lot of: gosh, well, we can make it look prettier

00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,139
at this great point, and at this point, but anywhere

00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,710
in between we are utterly screwed and no one has considered

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,710
this.

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,160
Also, you know, one of the things when you are at

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,599
a non-technical company, you're probably not going to

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:47,810
get to work on big projects, interesting projects, the

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,770
kind of projects that get you up in the morning as an

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,770
engineer.

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:58,520
You know, when you're taking something and building a web framework that has never been

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,331
built before, you're not solving problems that have

00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:03,310
never been solved before; you're building landing pages

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,740
for -- to sell make-up, and I wanted to do that because

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,240
I identified with that product.

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:21,190
But it wasn't engineering; it was web design.

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,800
And I think generally, when you are the only person making these

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,680
decisions, you don't get to choose, basically.

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,220
So how did I respond to this?

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,500
I got more productive than I'd ever been in my

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
life before.

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,250
I used to be a lazy developer, but I think a lot of us fall into software engineering,

00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,849
because it is a pretty reliable line of work.

00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:50,259
I've responded to being the only person who could fix things

00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,960
by purely trying to fix them, getting up every day and

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,069
working on weekends, and I also -- we had lunch & learns

00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:04,100
at this company, and I hosted about three or four

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,470
lunch & learns on web development, and I got the social media

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,219
manager and the executive assistant building their

00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:17,069
own personal websites and HTML and CSS, and this was was

00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,449
the most gratifying thing possible, building empathy

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,970
for software engineering by making it more of my kind around

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,389
me.

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,449
So if you have opportunity to do that, this is

00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,460
possible, you know, maybe not for consultants who are

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,800
working, but definitely possible if you are a salary employee

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,419
working in the same physical location as these non-technical

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,490
staff members.

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,509
You know, there is an engineer inside everyone just waiting to come out.

00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:53,629
And a lot of people recognise that engineering is sort of a better

00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:56,550
thing than the one they may have, and there may

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,800
be people on your customer support team or on your marketing

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,880
team who really want what you have, which is the skills

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,050
that got you into the job that you have.

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,970
And, you know, seek them out and use them.

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:22,550
So you're also now, when you are the only engineer, you're the only champion

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,460
that technology has.

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,500
You know, if you come from a traditional engineering environment, whoever

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,603
the sort of top engineer is, you know, your CTO, your

00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:35,800
VP of engineering, that person's job in addition

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,210
to making decisions and managing the day-to-day work

00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,969
of the department, they are always advocating for

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:48,560
technology to, you know, your C-level team or your owner

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,080
of the business.

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,750
And so if you have a powerful CTL, then that's somebody who can take the time to say,

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,639
"Well we need to spend a week writing tests for this,

00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:07,410
or we spend to spend a month refactoring our order service."

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,120
If you don't have somebody like that as a buffer

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,290
between you and management, then you are suddenly the

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,730
buffer.

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,690
You are both the engine and the buffer between

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,760
the engine and what's trying to make the engine work.

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,170
So you need a) to really really work on your communication

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,940
skills, and (b), you need to have a certain amount

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,070
of like gravitas and weight within the company.

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,880
Basically, that upper management needs to trust you that you're

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,660
not just fucking around when you say, "I need more

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,779
time to do this, to do it right."

00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,290
And if they don't trust you, then you will not get that time, and your

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,329
product will suffer for it.

00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:52,820
Pretty much inevitably.

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,980
On the other hand, there is a huge bright side which

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,000
is that as if you were the only engineer, nobody is

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,730
going to teach you how to be a better engineer at that

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,860
company.

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,690
So much of what we do as engineers on a team is the kind of unacknowledged labour of tutoring

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,279
other developers, and this happens pretty much automatically

00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,490
when you're working next to somebody who does a similar

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,060
thing to you, even the most junior developer and the

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,300
most senior, the intersection, the diagram of their

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,860
knowledge is not the total sum of their knowledge, but

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,610
two people together know more than any one person could.

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,750
And so basically, by osmosis, turning to somebody and

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:42,279
saying "how do I do this?", and obviously things like

00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,339
you're slack, you're IRAC, you end up learning quite

00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,980
a bit, but when you're the only engineer, you don't have

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,980
that.

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:58,310
So maybe you get good at spreadsheets, because spreadsheets are the way your company communicates

00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,310
with each other.

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,910
This was the case with me; if it didn't exist in a spreadsheet, it wasn't real.

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,010
Or maybe you get really good at e-mails or maybe try to

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,091
spend a lot of time with that print designer who is actually

00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:14,730
really good at their job and understands colour and

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,750
spacing in a way that you never will.

00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,671
But, you know, you can learn from them, you can learn from that, and you

00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:21,671
should.

00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:28,240
Because it is the most you are going to get in terms of

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
skill growth.

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,740
We've all been there, sort of a solitary developer with stack overflow as their only

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,110
real friend.

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,680
You always have stack overflow but that's never where

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,329
you're going to do most of your skill.

00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,940
If you for instance want -- like I did -- to learn how

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,860
to deal with problems of scale, which are some of the most

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,790
interesting at a web development company, then you're

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,649
not going to have the chance to do that as sort of

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,850
a lone wolf.

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,400
Anything that you can teach yourself, you'll learn, and anything that cannot be

00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,310
taught by other people, you will not learn.

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,430
So, you know, I felt very isolated a lot of the time

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,820
until something happened to me, which is that I started

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,779
going to meet-ups.

00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:28,370
And the first time I got on the Brooklyn JS slack channel, it was like a revelation,

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,209
there were cat gifts flying back and forth again, there

00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,810
were JavaScript and functional programming jokes which

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,100
are all terrible but they're the jokes we have, and we

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,730
love them.

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:49,860
So it turned out that as isolated as I felt there, I was really in the centre of a much

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,529
larger universe of developers in New York.

00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,490
There were literally hundreds of people around me who

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,770
I could go to for the sense of community, and sort of growth

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:08,660
opportunities that I needed as a developer.

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,009
When you experience stagnation, actually, even if you

00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:14,899
are in the middle of a large engineering team and start

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:18,899
to feel you're become stagnated, well guys, go to

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,079
a meet-up.

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,850
You're already here, so I can't tell you to go to a

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,880
conference, you clearly learned that trick, but there

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,070
are people out there who will actually, just for love

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,500
and not for money, do the work of teaching you.

00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,279
Do the work of supporting you.

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,200
Do the work of being your friend, which is work, and actually, when

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,630
you were at a company, that's part of what you're getting

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,589
paid to do, secretly.

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:47,269
The last thing is that if you were the only engineer

00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:51,030
at a company, if you were only the technical person,

00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,779
don't be scared to leave.

00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:57,800
I didn't get into that job because I wanted to be the only engineer at

00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,199
that company forever.

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,009
I wanted there to be more of me.

00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:06,940
And when -- how do you get more engineers besides helping

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,279
the social media manager build her own website?

00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,339
You hire them.

00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:14,690
One of the most important things when you're at a small

00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,779
company is whether you have any authority in the hiring

00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,420
process, whether candidates that you bring to your

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,380
bosses will be considered, and whether you get any, you

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,639
know, yes or no input on candidates.

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,959
If you don't have either of those things, you should consider

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,930
what kind of company or culture you're in, and as the realisation

00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,380
that slowly caught up to me when after six months of

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,060
being the only person there, I still was the only person

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,450
there, decided that it wasn't for me after all, being

00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,699
the lone wolf.

00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:53,540
So I left.

00:14:53,540 --> 00:15:01,009
I went to another big engineering company in New York, a 60-person

00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:02,009
developer team.

00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:05,990
I am happy to say I have everything I could want

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:11,250
in a job there, but the knowledge of what will happen,

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,230
the knowledge of what I will face if I ever go into the

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,370
situation again, if I decided to start my own start-up,

00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:27,600
or decided to be the CTO or the founding technical member of the team, it is all going to happen

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,180
again, the struggles are going to be the same, and in

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,100
some ways they'll be even worse, but I know what they

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,839
are now, so I'm not scared.

00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:36,079
