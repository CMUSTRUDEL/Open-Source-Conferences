Description: 
	It is long known that the quality and setting of the light in our environment influences our moods and minds in a near-infinite number of ways. Yet the lights in most homes and work places are still restricted to the ever present on-/and off-switches (and maybe some dimming).

Enough of that. Take some of the modern lighting-solutions today, add a healthy dose of JavaScript and sprinkle with some other web technologies to create and control your own lights to suit any of your moods and ideas – directly from within your browser. In a very colorful talk full of practical examples I will demonstrate a number of those possibilities.

Can we use these tricks to even control professional light-equipment on stage? You’ll see.
