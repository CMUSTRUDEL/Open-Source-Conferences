Description: 
	Compiling Java bytecode to JavaScript is an interesting problem to solve and many things can be learned from this challenge.

- The difference of JSVMs and performance implications
- The state of WebIDL and why it matters
- Types and optimizing compilers: an AOT love story

Technology is always just a means to an end. That’s why we’ll also look at self-optimizing display lists, WebGL and the WebAudio API in real-world apps.
