	00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:29,800
thank you for your time this afternoon

00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:33,560
so apart from looking for a life partner

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,260
looking for a job is one of the most

00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:42,080
important decisions that you'll make in

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:44,380
your life so think about the amount of

00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,180
time that you actually spend at work

00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:50,390
well you know every week every month

00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:55,130
every year and throughout the years it's

00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:57,650
an incredibly a large portion of your

00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:01,730
life incredibly important because it

00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:03,680
affects your happiness and help it

00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:08,330
affects your health and your well-being

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:12,560
and yet there's a lot of people out

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:18,920
there who haven't actually found their

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:22,220
dream job and when you look at some of

00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,610
the research around that it's quite

00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,549
extraordinary so seventy percent of the

00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:34,460
workforce is actually not engaged at

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:37,880
work two in five people are daydreaming

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:41,030
about leaving their current job every

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:46,299
month that's just a a big straw Denari

00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:51,970
so with such an important life decision

00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:54,439
why why is it that people aren't

00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,740
reaching their goal of finding their

00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:59,570
dream job so just as a show of hands who

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:07,759
likes looking for a job looking for a

00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:10,549
new job I see nobody great so basically

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,709
looking for a job is incredibly

00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:13,910
stressful so recent research actually

00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,860
found that

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,570
aside from the death of a loved one and

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,490
going through a divorce or break up

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,560
looking for a job was a third most

00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,600
stressful thing to do more stressful

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,420
than moving more stressful than planning

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,830
a wedding more stressful than getting a

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,660
root canal even more stressful than

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,940
public speaking I mean like right now I

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:40,190
would rather be doing this and looking

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:41,800
for a new job that's for sure so the

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,330
whole process of recruitment is

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,850
essentially fundamentally fundamentally

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,310
broken applying for jobs is really

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,500
really messy as it's messy from both the

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:55,150
candidate side as well as the company

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:58,150
side so from the candidates I'd you know

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:01,100
there's obviously like job boards is

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,080
like recruitment agencies that you can

00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:08,090
engage with but a lot of the time I

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:12,110
think people spend a lot of effort and

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,690
energy you know sending out their CV to

00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,580
lots of different job posts also

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,170
different recruiters and sometimes it

00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,050
kind of feels like you're essentially

00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:25,490
kind of throwing your CV into a black

00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:27,080
hole and hoping for the best from the

00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:31,930
company side it's actually not really

00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:36,110
that much better because you're

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:41,510
essentially always kind of inundated

00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:43,340
with with a lot of different kind of CVS

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,270
from from different channels you're

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,560
getting pressure from you know top

00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:54,700
executives about hiring better talent

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,700
and more efficiently particularly for

00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,520
fast-growing companies and yet they

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:05,000
continue to do and use the same channels

00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,870
over and over again and expect different

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,420
results and that kind of reminds me of

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:17,150
this so basically that's kind of how

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,609
high it came about so the founders of

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,770
hired world were all very successful

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:23,960
serial entrepreneurs and they got

00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,550
together and they talked about what has

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,389
been the biggest challenge for each of

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,909
them in trying to ski

00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:32,569
oh they're their companies everyone said

00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:34,370
hiring really great talent to build

00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:37,159
their businesses so what they decided to

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,680
do is create a company that solves the

00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:42,889
problem for absolutely everyone and that

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,590
happened in 2012 and then they started

00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:50,360
to ask themselves some questions so

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:52,430
first one so what if we looked at

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,979
traditional recruitment and

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,819
traditionally has always been

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,729
recruitment has always involved

00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:00,500
candidates applying to companies so what

00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:03,110
would actually happen if you took that

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,180
model and flipped it upside down so

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,680
instead of Candice applying for

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,879
companies what have you actually made

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:14,419
companies apply to candidates so second

00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:18,169
thing that they are asked is so there's

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:20,000
an incredible lack of transparency in

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:21,229
the recruitment process and that leads

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,319
to an incredible amount of

00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:26,509
inefficiencies so what if employers will

00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,210
actually require to give you up front

00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:33,319
compensation information when asking you

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:35,979
to interview with them and that's that's

00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,779
another component of higher that we've

00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:42,680
incorporated into the platform so

00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:44,449
firstly companies have to apply to

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,860
candidates and when they apply to

00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:49,689
candidates and send them an interview

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,689
requests they have to give up front a

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,279
compensation indicative compensation

00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,490
information as well so it's not a thing

00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:02,539
that they asked was so what if

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:05,750
candidates actually had a career

00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:09,770
counselor / career advisor helping them

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:13,839
along the entire process and a lot of

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:16,430
times you know you you you you have

00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,229
recruiters and and other people who are

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:22,129
very directly kind of financially

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:27,649
incentivized to put you into a job that

00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:29,689
you either may or may not like so having

00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:34,969
someone having someone who is completely

00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:36,440
objective who's able to kind of be there

00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:40,700
when you need them and

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:43,100
and and push you through the the process

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,380
of interviewing and assessing different

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,420
companies you know that of course is is

00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,870
incredibly valuable for you as a

00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,700
candidate and lastly what if you were

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,170
actually rewarded for getting a job I

00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,640
mean it's quite an achievement you've

00:06:54,170 --> 00:07:02,300
gone through this kind of like sometimes

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,530
a stressful exercise and you know

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,960
getting a job it's obviously like

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,850
incredibly it's an amazing feeling

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,390
you're really really excited so

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:13,970
shouldn't you be rewarded for that and

00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,800
that's exactly what happens when you get

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,240
hired on the hired platform so if you

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,350
get hired in Singapore we actually give

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:24,400
you a service play one Wi-Fi speaker I

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:29,240
should have two at home they're amazing

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:33,350
so basically I just want to talk really

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,240
briefly about what a good profile looks

00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:39,740
like when you're presenting yourself as

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,419
a software engineer to employers so in

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,640
my personal experience what I've

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:49,520
actually seen be really really

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:52,090
successful is candidate to tell a story

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,790
so you always kind of hear about like

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:59,780
like people in marketing and brands

00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:01,130
being very successful about engaging

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,300
their audience and getting people

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:08,030
interested by telling a story a CV a

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,270
hired profile it's exactly the same

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,220
thing when you tell a story about

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:16,790
yourself it gets people engaged it gets

00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,410
people interested so the the profiles

00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,020
that really get a lot of people's

00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,930
attention oh really ones that kind of

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,640
talk about you know what got you into

00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,760
stuff software engineering what are you

00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:32,060
passionate about why do you do this for

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,960
a living what what do you do in your

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:40,350
spare time thats thats related to what

00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,790
you do at work those are

00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:46,270
outlining those things will get you very

00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:50,290
very far far in making yourself stand

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:52,930
out amongst a lot of other potential

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,240
candidates for the same role the other

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:59,140
thing that is incredibly important is to

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,810
really kind of flush out all the other

00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,570
things that you do at outside of your

00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,600
day-to-day job that could include you

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,660
know open source contribution you know

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,840
your activity on github your activity on

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,860
stack overflow and other other different

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:22,570
channels side projects is it something

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,310
that you should always present in terms

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,680
of you know what you're tinkering with

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:30,310
because it helps employers really

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,050
understand how you think and also what

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:37,930
you're what you're really interested in

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:44,650
in as well so who's hiring excuse me so

00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:47,320
a short answer pretty much everybody so

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,940
in the context of Singapore there are so

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,850
many companies right now that are hiring

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:55,510
for software engineers those include

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,160
that you know obviously like the the

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:01,350
success stories here in Singapore you

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:06,360
know carousel kareena Sephora digital

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:10,570
but there is also a really long list of

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,840
incredible fast growing tech companies

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:16,090
here and there in across many many

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,790
different industries so in FinTech there

00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:23,100
in AI there in SAS there in autonomous

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:25,780
cars healthcare travel there's so much

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,540
opportunities out there for software

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:33,040
engineers right now that it's it's it's

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:35,830
really up to candidates to decide what

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,320
feel that they're interested in and you

00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,880
know what kind of roles and

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,250
responsibilities that they would

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,030
actually like to take on in their next

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:49,270
role and and also there's incredibly

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:52,960
large kind of public companies that are

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,070
hiring quite substantial software

00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,000
engineering teams

00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:00,970
in Singapore as well a key example you

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,440
you probably know that a lot of the big

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,990
financial services companies are

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,170
creating innovation centers and

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:14,410
innovation labs here in Singapore so

hired so this is the average salary in

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,270
singapore by broken down by the years of

00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,730

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,990
that salaries start off very high

00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,970
straight out of a university or straight

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,710
out of school and then they plateau very

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:18,160
quickly in singapore it's a little bit

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:22,780
