Title: Kenneth Auchenberg: DevTools Of The Future - JSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-08
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	The web has gained the capabilities to offer app-like experience, and with the recent additions the web is ready to replace many native apps. What does that mean for our developer tools? In this talk I‘ll share Microsoft‘s view on web tooling and what we do to make building for the web easier and more productive, regardless of the platform.

Kenneth is a Program Manager, focused on DevTools and Remote Debugging at Microsoft, and is obsessed with tooling.
He started the RemoteDebug initiative to unify remote debugging and lives in Vancouver, Canada and is the organizer of the ColdFront Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. 
Kenneth blogs occasionally at kenneth.io, and tweets as @auchenberg
