Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	I will share how Electron managed to attract users and contributors through the shear power of community, from the early days with just one user to now with a new app everyday.

Hello Everyone

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,760
Today, I'm going to be talking about Electron

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,740
Not the technical part.

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,060
I will talk about how I built the community for electron

00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,240
and how the community of Electron helped it grow

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,460
My name is Cheng

00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,460
And I created the Electron framework

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,140
I'm currently working at Github

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,720
and still working on Electron

00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,000
So if you have ever created an issue at Electron the repo

00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,560
you might known me because

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,900
I'm usually the guy who closed your issues

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,740
So before talking about Electron

00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,140
I need to talk about its history first

00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,540
It's still a relatively little project

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,740
But the history originated from node-webkit

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,500
And if you know about nw.js

00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,400
node-webkit is the older name of nw.js

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,900
So the first edition of node-webkit is the node.js module

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,920
It was not production-ready

00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,960
And then a year later

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,560
I joined the development of node-webkit

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,500
From that time node-webkit became a framework

00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,460
that you can develop desktop apps based on it

00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,820
It was basically the nw.js you know now

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,620
And then a year later I started a new project

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,460
named atom-shell

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,080
And it was open-sourced and

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,920
then renamed to Electron

00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,440
So the story of Electron

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,500
started from node-webkit

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,580
I joined the development of node-webkit

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,780
when I was doing an internship at Intel

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,500
At that time, node-webkit was

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,820
a perfect project for interns

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,080
Because it was interesting

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,080
It was open-source

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,860
And most importantly

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,760
no one was using node-webkit

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,140
So it doesn't matter if

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,540
an intern messed up with it

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,280
So I started as the only developer of node-webkit

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,560
And because there were no users,

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,360
I could just do whatever I want to the project

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,620
And most importantly

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,280
no one gave a shit about it so...

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,020
My manager didn't care

00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,160
and, well, the company didn't care

00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,000
It was just a project for interns

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,400
So for me, at that time

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,200
the most important thing was

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,320
to define what node-webkit should be

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,980
So at that time I decided that

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,280
I can probably rewrite webkit as

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,260
the platform to develop desktop apps

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,580
with html and node.js

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,680
There were already many projects

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,100
doing similar things, but...

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,540
apparently all of them were shit

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,140
So by working on node-webkit

00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,380
I can probably create a new generation project

00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,120
After spending a few months

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,180
developing node-webkit

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,360
Well, I finally got something

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,660
that really worked

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,600
My manager was happy with it

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,160
because I was

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,480
not wasting my time

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,140
doing unrelated things

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,220
It was a nice result

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,620
for interns

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,020
But a problem for me

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,840
was that it still had no users

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,520
I was just spending a few months

00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
entertaining myself

00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,820
entertaining my manager

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,080
It was not real open-source

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,100
So I decided to

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,700
build a community of node-webkit

00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,060
and had everyone using it

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,480
So the first thing I did

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,140
was to build a small community

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,700
at that time it was

00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,240
quite a simple one

00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,500
I used GitHub issues for bug reports

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,060
questions and any type of thing

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,040
And there was a mailing list on Google Groups

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,400
There were people

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,040
who were preferring

00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,460
the older type of discussion

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,380
So after building the community

00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,380
I started to promote node-webkit

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,580
and that's the

00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,780
most important thing for

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,380
new projects, you need to

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
make people know your project

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,580
So at that time node-webkit

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,360
didn't have a strong background

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,740
even though it was

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,860
a project sponsored by Intel

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,340
but there was a only an intern working on it

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,500
and the project was not

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
under Intel's GitHub account

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,000
It was actually under the account of

00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,740
an Intel employee

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,840
who wrote the first edition of node-webkit

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
When people saw node-webkit

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,020
they were just seeing it's a

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,940
simple project developed by no none

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,980
So I needed to advertise it

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,560
The thing I did was

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,680
announcements at different mailing lists

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,780
saying that I

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,600
created a new awesome project

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,760
Just come and use it

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,380
some people might be interested in it

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,640
they might ask very stupid questions

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,140
Well, at that time

00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,880
no matter how stupid the questions might be

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,420
I still needed to answer every one of them

00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,120
so I probably might have my first user

00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,740
And another important thing was

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,860
I needed to keep publishing a new release

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,100
So if I just do one release of the project

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
and then do nothing later

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,260
people would think

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,100
this was just a hobby project

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,180
If use it I will be fucked up in the end

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,280
So the most important thing is to

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,000
keep releasing

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,600
new versions of the project

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,380
After I kept doing so

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,540
I finally got my first user

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,440
That one was actually quite famous

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,200
If you knew

00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,260
Light Table was an editor

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,580
based on real web technology

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,540
It was like the fist program project on Kick Starter

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,740
So it gained a lot of

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
It was a very famous project and

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,380
it helped node-webkit get lots of attention

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,500
So once we had a first user

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,980
we might have a second and then more

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,120
After that the most important thing became

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,660
we needed to keep our first user

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,660
How do you keep them?

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,340
There's only one thing to do

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,380
is just answer their questions

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,540
and implement the features they want

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,460
and fix the bugs they are troubled with

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,040
They are getting support from you and

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,280
they will be confident in your project

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,920
So more and more people were

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,980
using node-webkit and I was

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,560
doing a good job of keeping them

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,720
Somehow, it started to become famous

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,980
So usually when your project becomes famous

00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,780
you actually have lots of choices

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
You can ask for sponsorship

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,520
from the big companies

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,380
who use your project

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,200
so you can get money

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
by working on your own project

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,340
Or you can ask some of the contributors

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,420
of the project to get into your team

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,540
so you have more people working on the project

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,020
or you can even start a company or career

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,800
based on your own project

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,680
probably you can make

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,320
huge money from it

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,040
One of them was just to

00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,300
keep your project growing bigger and bigger

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,340
As for me, it was a bit different

00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,960
Ater node-webkit became famous

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,580
I did not work on it anymore

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Because if you still remember

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,400
I did not own node-webkit

00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,860
I was just an intern that

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,860
was doing an internship on the project

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Once node-webkit became famous

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,820
as an intern, I just lost

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,680
the leadership of the project

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,020
It basically means I lost

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,960
the control of the project

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,920
It was not my project anymore

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,480
I ended my internship

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,660
and started the atom-shell project

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,040
atom-shell, if you still remember,

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,080
was the old name of Electron

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
For the first year of Electron

00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,440
it was unlike the first year of node-webkit

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,660
because this time

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,860
the development of Electron was sponsored by GitHub

00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,620
because they were secretly developing

00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,440
the Atom editor

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,720
they thought that node-webkit was

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,520
a great platform, but it was not good enough

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,500
so they hired me to work on

00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,900
the new atom-shell platform

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,300
At that time, I was still the only developer

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,140
for Electron

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,680
That was fine because

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,520
my only user was Atom editor

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,960
and all I had to do was to

00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,200
make the Atom editor a great product

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,380
based on atom-shell

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,580
After working on Electron for one year

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,880
it was open-sourced together with Atom

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,660
and unlike the launch of node-webkit

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,120
the launch of Electron was quite easy

00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,500
because it was a product of GitHub

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,740
and there was an open-source project using Electron

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,660
the first days of Electron we had

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,760
we had lots of stars on GitHub and

00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,920
we got a lot of new users

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,000
just within a few weeks

00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,980
Since we were not worried about getting new users

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,900
the task for me became

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,820
I needed to

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,980
keep Electron a good project

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,980
a project that people would be confident to use

00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,000
and a project that could be

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,220
used for a very long time

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,660
To achieve that, I just needed to

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,560
keep the project well-maintained

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,800
For the community,

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,520
this time Slack was quite popular

00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,740
at that time

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,700
It's much better than

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,700
the older IRC channel

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,320
It's very modern

00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,640
so we used

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,380
Slack as our community channel

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,020
we also added some more forums for discussion

00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,180
And this time, for Electron

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,040
I didn't use mailing lists anymore

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
because it was very hard to use

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,080
and for GitHub issues,

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,540
I wouldn't allow questions for

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
when I developed node-webkit

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,120
But that is generally bad

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,920
when you project became quite big

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,960
because there would be many people

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,580
asking questions in the issues

00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,820
and it would distract the development of the project

00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,300
And to...

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,480
make the project well-maintained

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,980
one of the important things is to

00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,580
manage the issues well

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,900
Basically, I think

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,260
the central idea is to

00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,260
answer every issue

00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,540
you don't have to, like...

00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,000
do support for every people, but

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,260
for issues you need to make people know that

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,560
this issue has been looked into

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,220
so every issue should either be closed

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,780
or tagged

00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,520
If you have an issue that there was no answer

00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,420
and no response

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,880
then hanging there a few months

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,400
it would make people feel

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,600
the project had been abandoned

00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,900
And when closing issues

00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,100
it's important to

00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,420
let the user know

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,480
why the issue is closed

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,580
maybe because the issue

00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,860
was a question

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,180
or maybe we have a duplicated issue

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,060
when closing issues

00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,540
you have to at least tell why

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,100
you closed it, otherwise people

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,080
would be mad about it

00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,340
and another thing

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,740
to give contributors more permission

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,620
If a contributor can have

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,760
permission to close the issue

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,200
they may be more involved into the project

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,120
they will think they are part of the project

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,820
Apart from issues

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,660
another part of managing the project

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,080
is to respect the pull requests

00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,720
Pull requests are the

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,660
passage of the new generation

00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,600
It represents how people like to contribute

00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,740
to your project

00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,940
When people create the project to

00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,180
When people create the pull request to your project

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
they will expect

00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,720
you can review their contribution

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,520
in time

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,720
So my suggestion is to

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,360
When there is a new pull request, you should

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,020
review them as soon as you can

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,520
so people can feel valued

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,300
Not everyone knows how your project works

00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,460
so for most pull requests

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,180
you may have

00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,880
when that happens

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,680
you should get them to code review

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,860
by commenting the problem

00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,720
in the code review

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,700
People can know your project better

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,380
and sometimes you can

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,300
When people don't understand your project

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,900
code review is a very good way

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,440
to tell people the details

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,360
But it doesn't mean we need to

00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,820
merge every pull request

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,540
it will harm the project

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,840
because code quality

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,520
When there are very bad contributions

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,620
don't hesitate to reject the pull request

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,400
And if a pull request is

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,040
not very good but still has value

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,500
I suggest doing refactoring of the code

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,400
after merging

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,540
The last thing to keep

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,420
the project well-maintained is to

00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,420
make contribution easier

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,160
There are many ways to achieve that

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,240
One of the common things is

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,140
to have a "bootstrap" script

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,520
which can automatically set up

00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,840
everything your project needs

00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,840
Like setting up the building environment

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,980
Like synching your submodules

00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,000
It's also important to have

00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,920
detailed documentation on the

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,520
development of the project itself

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,840
You can have documentation

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,020
explaining the architecture of your project

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,240
and best practice for things

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,160
Apart from that, you can also tag

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,300
tasks in the issues for beginners

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
so if someone is interested in

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,540
contributing to your project

00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,580
but has no idea what to do

00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,220
they can always search for the easy issues

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,480
and work on that first thing

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,420
And when the project keeps growing

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,720
at a certain stage

00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,200
there will be companies starting to

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,000
use your project

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,240
For Electron we have Facebook

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,620
Microsoft, Slack, and

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
various startups

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,940
building there products based on Electron

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
And that's really a very good thing

00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,140
Apart from passion, money is the

00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,320
only thing that can keep open-souce

00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
projects alive

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,740
But people are doing business

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,840
based on the project

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,400
They will put resources on it

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,760
and the project will always

00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,460
And having company users

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,380
can attract more users

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,080
because when a big company

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,160
is using the project

00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,100
people would be very confident

00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,380
the project can be good

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,140
and used for a long time

00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,440
and the company's users usually

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,520
contribute a lot back

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,880
because they always have their unique requests

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
they have lots of developers

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,300
and usually they are very good developers

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,640
and when they need something

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,540
they would choose to build the things they want

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,300
and then contribute it back

00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,180
But still, sometimes company users

00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,880
can actually be bad

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,960
For some companies

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,080
they're like your busiest users

00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,920
and when they have something

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,080
that needs to be done

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,500
you would put those things on

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,340
the top of your todo list

00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,000
and sometimes that can disturb your

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,880
original development plan

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,900
And for some users

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,940
when they found they need to

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,320
a new feature of the project

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,340
or they want to

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,260
refactor the project for another

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,540
sometimes they just fork your project

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,160
instead of contributing things back

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,780
because most

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,320
can take a lot of time

00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,140
and for some companies

00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,500
they just decide to fork

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,280
the project

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,020
and forking can be

00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,220
very bad for open-source

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,540
So Electron keeps growing

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
at a certain stage

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,660
it became a huge task

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,340
for one developer to maintain

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,140
These are the emails I got everyday

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,220
So it's impossible for just me

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,040
to answer all of the

00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,780
issues and sometimes the

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,720
new pull requests everyday

00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,940
and I need to take lots of time

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,440
reviewing them

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,260
And if I put too much

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,400
energy into the community

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,760
I would have no time

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,780
for developing the project itself

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,580
which can be very bad

00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,380
Currently Electron became a team

00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,360
so now it's not only me working on the project

00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,380
but have a small team

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,080
working on Electron

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,600
Some of the team members are from

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,920
other teams of GitHub

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,620
and we also had a few

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,420
new developers

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,540
and most importantly

00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,980
we are still hiring

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,860
So at last

00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,380
if you are interested in joining

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,220
the Electron team

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,540
you can send email to this

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,940
email address

00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,060
groundwater@github.com

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,620
Groundwater is our new manager

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,580
of the Electron team

00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,540
If you are interested in Electron

00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,260
just follow him
