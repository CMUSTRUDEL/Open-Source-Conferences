Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	Have you ever been in a betting pool for your local football league? Then you might know, how exhausting it is, to come up with sensible results for every single game and most of us are not using the scientific method... at all. No need to fret about it anymore! Iâ€™ll show you how to write a program that learns to predict football scores with the help of the Node.js library synaptic.

Lian is working as Jack of all trades at the interface between development and support. She completed her apprenticeship as IT specialist in early 2014, after a failed attempt at becoming a lawyer.
