Title: Raquel Vélez: Wombat-Driven Understanding - An Interactive Guide To Using npm - JSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-10
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	So you want to write some software. And you decide to use npm, because everyone’s saying it’s the coolest thing ever. Great!
But... where do you start? And once you’ve started, how do you take advantage of the advanced features?
Let’s write an app together! Whether you’re brand new to using npm or have been using it for years, I guarantee you’ll learn a new trick or two - or at least get a good laugh!

Raquel cares about code and culture at npm, Inc. in Oakland, CA. She has previously worked at institutions such as Caltech, NASA JPL, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and various universities in Europe. She is a co-author of the book "Make: JavaScript Robotics."
In her off time, you can find her baking, teaching NodeBots not to fall off of tables, and speaking. ... also, hanging out with her hilarious husband and two cats dressed in dog suits.

i am i'm rockbot on the interwebs so

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,610
follow me whatever I work at NPM NPM

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,740
started out as open-source but it's a

00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,409
company now and I was actually employee

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,909
number one and as employee number one I

00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,190
was a web engineer and then I moved up

00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,659
to being a tech lead in the web team and

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,719
now I'm the engineering manager for the

00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:45,989
web team and today what I'd like to do

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,269
is kind of take you through NPM kind of

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,219
like to stir it over but let's just kind

00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:51,870
of play with NPM a bit today but before

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,479
I do that the first thing I want to do

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,239
is kind of talk a little bit about NPM

00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:59,579
NPM is a package manager for JavaScript

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,199
a lot of people think NPM means node

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,329
package manager

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,129
it turns out it doesn't mean that it's

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,070
just three random letters that someone

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:13,740
put together it you could say that it

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:15,180
has no prescribed meaning okay but

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,619
here's the other funny saying Java

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,070
scripts a bit of an is a misnomer as

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,859
well because there's CSS in our

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,439
repository earth in the registry there's

00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:28,380
go there's rust there's C++ so in

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,909
reality NPM is just a package manager

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,240
but I'd like to think it's pretty cool

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,359
and our number one priority at NPM is to

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,359
reduce friction you all have an

00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,579
important job to do you want to write

00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,399
code push to production make cool stuff

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,310
the last thing you want is to have your

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,560
tools get in the way so everything we do

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,799
every product you build every service we

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,920
create the major takeaway for us is is

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,340
this going to make your lives easier so

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,719
with all of that in mind let's build an

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,450
app our app is going to be a random

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,039
wombat fact generator and it's going to

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,360
be a command-line client because we

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,450
don't have a lot of time and I just kind

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,810
of want to get moving

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:17,590
whatever now this is a wombat it's a

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,150
marsupial native to Australia and you're

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,340
PI wondering why wombats that seems

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,360
ridiculous well it turns out if you take

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,420
the NPM logo and you flip it around it

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,910
no longer says NPM it says wdu which

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,660
obviously not obviously really means

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,310
wombat developer Union and all of the

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,319
people at NPM we've refer to ourselves

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,269
as wombats and this is our little mascot

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,769
and if you want to know why were the

00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:43,959
wombat developer Union and why we chose

00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:46,090
a wombat in the first place come find me

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,410
afterwards I have a bunch of stickers we

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,049
can talk about wombats and NPM and all

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,849
that good stuff okay so I'm going to

00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:53,980
start talking really really really fast

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:55,599
the good news is this is being recorded

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,890
so you can go onto YouTube later and you

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,810
can go ahead and put it down to a one

00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,940
point or a point five X so that you're

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,470
not talking about fast but we've a lots

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,459
of stuff to cover so great okay the

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,290
first thing that we're gonna do in

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:07,500
building this app we are going to

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,209
install node J s if you haven't already

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,540
I personally prefer to go to node J s

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:16,030
org - and press the big green button

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,739
it's easy it's fast you can use homebrew

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,150
or whatever else you want I just prefer

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:23,230
to go straight to the source

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:25,600
now NPM comes bundled with node but N

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,030
Pam's release process is at a different

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,230
rate then nodes release process and

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,620
we're gonna hear all about nodes release

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:35,470
process later for miles but suffice it

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,389
to say that most of the time when you're

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,000
installing node you probably have a

00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:42,010
slightly out of date NPM in fact if it's

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,739
been a few weeks since you updated NPM

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,630
go ahead and update it again so you want

00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,730
to go and Pam I NPM at latest Ashby

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:52,000
fantastic okay now let's get to building

00:03:48,730 --> 00:04:00,670
this app are we ready we're gonna do

00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,139
this live to do okay so here we are

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,180
we're in our nice little terminal

00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,280
fantastic and the first thing I want to

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,530
point out is that any time you have

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,389
questions or whatever from right within

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,579
your terminal you can ask ask for help

00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:14,169
and it's really it's an easy you can

00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:16,030
just kind of be like alright well what

00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:18,789
do i do how does this work fantastic

00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,989
okay moving on so the first thing we're

00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:21,480
going to do is we're going to create a

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,310
directory

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,570
of random wombat facts this is gonna be

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,850
our application and if you're looking at

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,470
this and going what kind of syntax is

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,200
that that's not bash it's cuz it's fish

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,980
shell I like it I'm not gonna have a

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,300
shell war with you but I'm okay

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,260
so we're creating an application so the

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,020
first thing that we're gonna do is we're

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,240
gonna do NPM an it now NPM an it is an

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,580
automated tool to create a package dot

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,770
JSON your package JSON is essentially a

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,930
manifest file for your entire app it's

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,700
where the computers basically gonna say

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,110
okay what dependencies do you have what

00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,400
is the name of your app what version is

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,150
it on what's the description all of

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,760
those good things

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,980
now you could of course totally make it

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,720
by yourself but why would you do that

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,950
I'm a lazy developer I don't know if

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,740
you're lazy developers but I'm totally

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,050
lazy developer and if I can I totally

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,650
want my computer to do all the work for

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:13,230
me so here we are in this automated tool

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,420
and anything that's in parentheses is

00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,310
kind of a default and so I'm like okay

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,130
you know what named random wombat backs

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,750
that sounds great version 1.0.0

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:27,300
fantastic description random wombat fact

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,100
generate or fantastic entry point we're

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,230
gonna have some file called index at J s

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,270
that sounds good we won't have any tests

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,100
just ignore that and no get repo

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:41,910
whatever it's fine we're doing it live

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:43,500
and so wombats fast jazz cough fantastic

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,600
so some keywords that will be useful for

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,610
searches later and then you need to add

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,710
a license now is C is a pretty standard

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,030
open-source license but in the event

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,800
that you don't want to license something

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,680
you know what you don't have to license

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,680
it you can just say unlicensed is this

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,480
okay yes sounds great so now all we have

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,720
in here is just a simple back package

00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,860
JSON and that's what it looks like and

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,300
this is what's gonna be stored in the

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,220
registry and this is what the website

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,320
uses to kind of show off what version

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,200
you're on and all that good stuff okay

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,690
so we know that our entry point is

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,200
indexed is so we're going to go ahead

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:23,540
and build that so let's do an index J is

00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:28,560
and we're going to am I going too fast

00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:30,980
fantastic good okay so we're going to

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,070
create a really really really basic

00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:40,190
little array

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:43,520
facts and we're just gonna do and this

00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:45,350
is gonna be the easiest little nodejs

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,930
script you've ever seen we're just gonna

00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:52,580
console.log this fat and cool and now

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,310
we're gonna do it note index a a yes and

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,170
boom that's our fact one okay beautiful

00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,480
we don't have to applause yet

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,710
plaws later love applause all if you

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:06,290
want applause I'll take the applause

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:07,520
okay all right so this was great but

00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,160
what do we really want to do we want

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,560
something to randomly grab one item from

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,130
that array right now of course we could

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,640
totally just go ahead and say um mascot

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,860
random mascot floor some algorithm in

00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,540
you know what someone has probably

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,070
already written this because it is the

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,040
most commonly used code for any

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:30,140
randomizer so let's just see if maybe a

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,630
package like that already exists so what

00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:37,280
we gonna do we're gonna go to NP MJS

00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:39,260
calm and we're going to open up the

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,560
search and I know what you're thinking

00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:45,850
you're gonna say Vachel and cams are

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:50,810
just terrible not anymore

00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:52,010
alright so what do we see here just kind

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,440
of we just put in a little search for

00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,490
random array and hey would you look at

00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,020
that get a random item from an array

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,480
that's exactly what we're looking for

00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,500
Thank You syndra Soros okay so we're

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,250
going to take a look at that package

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,200
page and sounds cool so in order to

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,240
install it we do an NPM install - - to

00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,770
save random item and then we're gonna we

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,410
have an API for using it so let's go

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:18,950
ahead and do that we're going to say and

00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:21,590
p.m. install random item - save

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:24,890
beautiful fantastic and the reason why

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:27,050
we do - - save is because again we want

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,730
that package JSON manifest to kind of

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,820
have all of our dependencies listed in

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,580
there and we could do it Ottoman we

00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,020
could do it ourselves but I'm a lazy

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,970
developer and I hope you're a lazy

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,860
developers - so why do it ourselves when

00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,680
the when the you know program can do it

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,750
for us plus it tells you it goes ahead

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,570
and saves the exact version that you're

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,800
using all the names

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,570
you don't worry about typos or anything

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,970
so if we wanted to take a look at the

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,530
package.json you can see right here we

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,740
have our random item dependency

00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:58,600
beautiful okay now this is less of an

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,970
NPM thing and more of an ode practice

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,110
thing I don't always believe everything

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:07,540
I read on the internet so I'm gonna do a

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,580
little trust but ferret by type thing so

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,350
in case you're not aware node has a read

00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,720
eval print loop also known as the repple

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,870
where you can kind of sandbox with

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,280
packages that you've installed and so as

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,540
long as you've already installed it into

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,580
the current directory you just as do

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,090
node and then you can kind of play with

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:33,550
a you can play with the the packages

00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:35,230
that you've just pulled in and and you

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,200
can kind of just do okay so according to

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:41,320
the readme the API is just a Rando of

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,450
array and it should just pull okay cool

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,820
so this works exactly as I expect it's

00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:49,270
pulling random ones fantastic

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:54,430
so now I'm gonna go ahead and update my

00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:59,700
index a J yes to have this right am

00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:10,540
andum item require random item and

00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:14,770
update this to have random item and now

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:17,530
if I do node index J yes all right back

00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,620
to fact to fact one alright cool so it's

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:23,410
doing exactly what we were asking for

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:27,960
beautiful okay so that worked exactly

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:32,290
the way we wanted and now I'm going to

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,900
so okay again really lazy I'm such a

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,000
lazy programmer I really don't like

00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,200
writing node index dot G is over and

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,430
over and over again and what I'm about

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,080
to do is gonna make a go

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,950
you didn't actually make it better but I

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,570
want you to think about your own

00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,430
applications where you're kind of like

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,320
when you're starting up your app maybe

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,390
it's not just a single point of entry

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,740
right maybe you have a gulp script that

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,500
you want to run before you start your

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,670
app up maybe you have a test suite that

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,620
you want to run before you start your

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,450
app up well we're gonna create an NPM

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,400
start script and the way that we do that

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,830
is we go into our package JSON

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,720
and we create a new script called start

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,640
and there are a few scripts that have

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,730
special keywords like start and test is

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,110
that you can just use NPM start and I'll

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,260
show you that in a second but you can

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:18,940
just do basically index node index dot J

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:21,160
yes and now if I do npm start it'll run

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,990
the exact same thing and so it's just a

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,640
little bit of an easier thing like i can

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,779
set whatever it is i want you can you

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,730
can also change that to be a bash script

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:29,260
if you really want it to but you can

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,600
just have it you can put it I just bash

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,390
straight into that into your package a

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,050
JSON so that's pretty cool but I don't

00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,730
know if you noticed my my codes a little

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,589
wonky I've got some semicolon some

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,980
places and some semicolons not in other

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,450
places and you know missing so what's

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,580
one thing that I could do to kind of

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:52,000
clean up my code well I can use a

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:55,510
package like standard to go ahead and

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,040
clean this up because you know what am I

00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,540
doing here again I don't want to have to

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,760
think about this I want to have other

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,589
other modules take care of this for me

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,220
so I'm going to go ahead and and Pam

00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:08,230
install standard and again I'm lazy you

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,260
don't have to use and can install you

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,930
can just do NPM I and I'm gonna do a - -

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,670
save - dev I can also change this to

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:21,730
just - D with a capital D now so here's

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:24,150
the thing about standard and actually

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,250
any module usually you would kind of

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:30,370
install it globally with a - G kind of

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:33,459
like we did with NPM but it turns out

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,500
you don't ever I mean ever have to

00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:37,510
install a module globally so especially

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,950
if you have an application that you're

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,020
working on and other people on your team

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,730
are also working on the exact same thing

00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,230
you know sometimes you're like oh shoot

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,970
I completely forgot to tell you have to

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,290
install this one thing globally you

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,930
don't have to do that ever ever ever

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,779
again just install it as a dev

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,640
dependency because you're the whole

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:55,690
point of dev dependencies versus regular

00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,800
dependencies is that your dev

00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,300
dependencies don't need to go into

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,830
production they have nothing to do with

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,690
your actual code it's just kind of sad

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,490
stuff so okay so you've your dev

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,480
dependency in there and then I'm gonna

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:11,860
go ahead and create a new rum script

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:16,130
and I'm gonna call it standardized and

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:18,680
Amna dues runs standard and what that's

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:25,600
going to do for me is I can do npm run

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:28,700
standardized and because standard is a

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,620
it's not a reserved word so like start

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,000
or test you have to use the word run

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,890
there you can't just say npm

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,600
standardized you NPM run standardized

00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,670
and so there were a whole bunch of

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,830
errors oh my gosh why well it's because

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,660
standard had a bunch of errors and it

00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,760
said hey look you you had extra

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,050
semicolons and that was really gross cuz

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,270
standard apparently doesn't like

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,520
semicolons whatever standard fine

00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:53,300
compromise you're doing the job that I

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:56,060
want to do so uh the recommended fix is

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,340
- standard - - fix now a lot of people

00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,470
kind of would say oh well I guess I'll

00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:03,530
have to create a brand new start startup

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:08,750
script or NPM run script so that I can

00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:10,940
have a - - fix in there but fun fact you

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,760
could just as easily and Pam run

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,200
standardized if you add a - - right

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,760
after your run script you can add

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,370
parameters that you would normally add

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,100
to your command line and so I basically

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,080
just ran - - fix on the NPM run

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,210
standardized and you can see what

00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,430
essentially happened is it ran standard

00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:36,230
- - fix for me so that's pretty cool -

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:38,540
okay so from there good okay so now I

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,720
want to build another module I want to

00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:44,060
build a module of wombat facts right

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,520
now the difference between a package and

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,830
a module is that a package is something

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:52,220
that you would that you can kind of

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:54,430
install with NPM but a module is

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,750
something that you can actually use with

00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:01,790
nodes module loader so you'd use the

00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:03,910
require syntax and so not all packages

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:08,990
or modules but all modules or packages

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:10,460
ish but yeah so we're gonna do is I like

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,570
to modulate my code I like to break it

00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,790
up into different pieces and I just

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,800
think about well what kinds of modules

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,090
would other people want to use I have no

00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,070
idea what kind of things people would

00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,490
want with what random on that facts but

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,279
that's cool we're going to

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,830
bill that anyway so let's go and create

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:30,089
a brand new directory called wombat

00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:33,420
facts mmm and we're gonna go into that

00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:35,790
directory now creating a module is the

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,800
exact same process as creating an

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,959
application we're gonna do an NPM in it

00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,529
now here's the thing about NPM in it if

00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,540
I'm totally cool with all of the little

00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:47,940
automated bits and pieces I can just say

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,230
unpin minute - - yes and it'll take care

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,080
of it for me you can also do just a

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,970
regular - why and so no it doesn't have

00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,770
the description or the keywords you know

00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,209
what I'm lazy and that happened really

00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,970
fast I did you press ENTER like a whole

00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:02,430
bunch of times so that's pretty nice and

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,529
now I'm going to go again into index -

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:07,800
is but because I'm creating a module I

00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:11,160
need you module dot exports and I'm

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:15,510
going to create this fact one in fact

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:20,520
two in fact three and that's all

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:21,930
fantastic and so that's cool and what I

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,580
think a lot of people would do right now

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,500
is they would kind of publish with some

00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,630
sort of alpha thing or whatever to try

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,209
to test it on their other application

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,680
you don't have to do that thing is I

00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,930
don't want anybody to accidentally

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,310
download this right now I just wanted to

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,140
check to see if it works in my regular

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,839
application so I'm going to use is a

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,490
thing called an cam link and what an cam

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,000
link does is it creates a sim link

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:48,329
between your your working directory and

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,270
a directory and user local Lib node

00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:53,300
modules and then I'm gonna go ahead and

00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:56,160
go back to my random wombat fax

00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:58,470
application and I'm going to do NPM link

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,600
wombat fax and what that does is it

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,149
creates another sim link from that user

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,730
or local Lib node modules and puts it

00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:08,040
straight into my node modules now for if

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:11,520
you were wondering node modules is where

00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,890
all of your packages live and so so

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,449
that's pretty neat and now if I were to

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,339
now it's kind of like you had just

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:18,360
installed it even though I didn't really

00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,850
install it because I didn't really

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:25,920
publish it now I can go into my index a

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:31,440
Jas and I can change these facts here to

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:33,990
require wombat facts and if all goes

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,910
well if I can just do NPM start

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,860
and I should still get fact one fact

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,050
three or whatever but if you're a little

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,970
bit like okay wait but it said fact one

00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:46,140
in fact two facts three before that's

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:56,100
cool let's go ahead and update our index

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:58,290
at Jassim real wombat facts and so

00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,670
here's some real wombat facts and note I

00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,100
haven't done anything I don't need to

00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,450
NPM link again I don't need to do I need

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,830
to publish or anything and I'm just

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,960
gonna go ahead I just changed

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,130
directories back into my random wombat

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,020
facts app and I'm gonna NPM start and

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,570
turns out they have a backwards facing

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,670
pouch like other marsupials wombats give

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,020
Berk to a tiny underdeveloped baby that

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,910
calls into its mother's pouch to grow

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,290
and develop further but wombats pouches

00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,880
have a special difference they are

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,950
positioned backwards opening toward the

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,270
mothers rear rather than their head this

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,220
allows her to dig without getting dirt

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,160
in her pouch that's a pretty cool little

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,840
fact also wombats have slow metabolisms

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,000
it takes the wombat up to 14 days to

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,380
digest a meal this low metabolism helps

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,570
them out and they're hot and dry habitat

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:45,380
so very cool I think it's pretty cool

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,380
okay

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,350
alright now I'm ready to go ahead and

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,570
publish this module the first thing when

00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:56,410
I do is into NPM unlink so it kills it

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:59,250
takes out that at that sim link and now

00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:01,330
I'm going to go ahead and publish it now

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,310
keep in mind that in order to publish

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:09,220
you need to have an account on NPM you

00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:12,010
can either NPM you can NPM log in and I

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,360
think you can do an NPM signup I think

00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,710
it might be an M camp sign up so you can

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,000
do that on the CLI or you can just go to

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,800
the website and create an account there

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,400
or if you already have an account then

00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,740
just make sure you NPM log in for sure

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,160
now I'm a little weary about creating a

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,990
wombat facts like high-level module me

00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,970
because somebody else already took the

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,650
name or I'm just not sure I'm ready to

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,860
do have that kind of commitment to the

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:38,050
public so what I could do is I can scope

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,960
this module and what that means is I can

00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:43,420
put it under my username scope usually

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,610
we think about scopes as an organization

00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,790
scope which you have to pay for your

00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:51,250
company has to pay for orgs or a private

00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:53,260
scope like a solo account where you can

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,920
basically create private modules but

00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,930
guess what

00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,820
you can totally create public scoped

00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:01,000
modules to and the way that we do that

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,760
is we go into our package a JSON I'm

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,610
going to change this to at rockbot slash

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,010
wombat fax and if you're ever curious

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,390
about if you're logged in or not if you

00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,100
just do NPM Who am I

00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:15,760
it'll tell you who you're logged in as

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:19,690
so good good trick and so now I can do

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,570
and PM publish with a dash dash access

00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:25,170
equals public so with that that allows

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:29,710
you to create a public scoped module and

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:32,910
it should work so now I've published it

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:36,520
and I can go ahead and take a look at

00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:43,930
this if you're wondering about this

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:46,450
thing it's I'm using Alfred fax and lo

00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:49,600
and behold here we go I've published it

00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:52,870
and it's a version 1.0.0 and that's

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,440
fantastic ooh um oh no no readme found

00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:59,440
what do we do

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,440
let's go ahead and create a repeat and

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:09,679
so we're just gonna kind of do a really

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:13,340
quick read me and now when you create a

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,620
readme it's not really a major change to

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,110
your module instead it's just kind of

00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,240
like a little thing so what I'm gonna do

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,250
is I'm gonna bump my patch version I'm

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,830
gonna put my version to bump the patch

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:28,519
and so you can actually use NPM version

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,690
patch and so you can do patch minor or

00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,669
major and I'll talk about that in just

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,460
second and then you can add a little bit

00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:37,549
of a tag like I'm creating a readme or

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,789
something like that and what version

00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:42,679
will do is it'll not only update your

00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:44,600
version number but it'll also create a

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,700
new commit if you have a github repo

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,590
it'll create a new commit with all of

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,169
these updates and it'll create a new get

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:56,179
tag so when you push up make sure you

00:21:51,169 --> 00:22:00,080
remember to get push and get pushed

00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:02,389
- tags but I don't have a github repo

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,580
for this project right now so ignore

00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:12,019
that but if I do an NPM publish again

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:15,110
now as soon as it publishes I should be

00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:17,179
able to find that pack now there should

00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,750
be a readme tada

00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:19,750
okay fantastic

00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:30,159
okay so let's say I totally didn't like

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:35,230
this at all and I really want I just was

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:38,919
not a fan so I can unpublish and I can

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:40,659
just say unpublish and what end him

00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:44,379
unpublished tends to do is if you only

00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,789
have one little module if you only have

00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:48,700
one version it'll go ahead and delete

00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:52,059
that one version or it'll unpublish just

00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,369
one pieces of it but specifically it's

00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:57,070
good to say explicitly what version you

00:22:54,369 --> 00:23:00,929
want to unpublish so I can you know NPM

00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:03,549
unpublish rock that one about facts at

00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:04,629
one point 0.0 because I really didn't

00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,359
like the fact that didn't have a readme

00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:10,450
so cool I can unpublish that or if I

00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:14,109
want to unpublish everything I can

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:16,509
unpublish with a dash F or a dash dash

00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:20,730
force and that one publish the entire

00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:23,109
package in its entirety and you know I

00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:26,919
we sure hope you know what you're doing

00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:30,909
when you do that but then as you will

00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,769
see it's not found it's totally gone now

00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:35,109
one major thing that a lot of people try

00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:39,940
to do is they'll go hey wait a second I

00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:45,159
I want to I want to publish I want to

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:48,940
republish version 1.0.0 well let me tell

00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:52,289
you that is not a good idea and here's

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:55,029
why let's talk about semver for a second

00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:56,710
miles borns is going to go a little bit

00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:57,519
more in detail about some verse I'm just

00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,279
gonna do a really really high level

00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,919
version but with December some very

00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:05,080
semantic versioning it is a handshake

00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:06,879
that you do with the rest of the

00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,700
developer community at least within the

00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,539
NPM land where you basically say I

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,809
promise

00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:17,139
I sure do solemnly swear that I am up to

00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:20,230
very good and what you're basically

00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:22,299
saying is whatever this number is when I

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,859
make a change I will update this number

00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:27,159
to reflect the type of change that I'm

00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:28,539
about to do so the the last digit is

00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,279
going to be your patch and that's

00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:32,740
something that's like okay if I have

00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,309
some bug fixes or I forgot to add a

00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,529
readme

00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:37,149
doesn't actually affect the code that

00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:40,749
much it's just gonna be like this tiny

00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:44,409
tiny thing now you can use NPM version

00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:47,799
patch to to bump that and then if you

00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:49,840
have a minor so if you change the middle

00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,519
number that's because you've added some

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,899
new features maybe you've extended your

00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:57,940
API or you've you know just kind of made

00:24:55,899 --> 00:25:00,519
something a little bit cooler so that's

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,169
a minor that's npm version minor and

00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:05,289
then if you have a major breaking change

00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,970
like your deprecating a function you are

00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:09,669
completely rewriting how a function

00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:11,590
works you're using modules that have

00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,299
also totally had massive breaking

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,980
changes then you're gonna go ahead and

00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:18,190
bump that in major and that's NPM

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,779
version major and so again this is a

00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,730
handshake that you're making with the

00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:24,399
rest of the community when somebody

00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:27,159
comes in and to support and says hey I

00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,580
accidentally unpublished my version 1.0

00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,220
point

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:33,669
oh and I don't want to create a new

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:36,669
version 1.0 point one can I just rewrite

00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:38,259
1.0 point oh no you can't and the reason

00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:39,970
for that is that you've now violated the

00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:41,830
handshake that's kind of like giving

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,899
somebody a present and saying hi I

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,639
bought you a present it's this really

00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:47,740
amazing cake and it's chocolate and

00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:50,440
delicious and then saying oh wait a

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,509
second I'm just gonna take that back and

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,129
then and then you kind of like give them

00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:56,320
like a vanilla cake instead and it's

00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:57,460
like a vanilla cake is good but it's not

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,490
the chocolate one that you gave me

00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,529
originally why why what happened my

00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,299
chocolate cake right and slowly that's

00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:06,340
the community is expecting you to uphold

00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:08,019
this and here's the fun fact versions

00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,909
are cheap they're completely free

00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:11,619
they're completely free so it's totally

00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:13,480
okay if you have to bump your version
