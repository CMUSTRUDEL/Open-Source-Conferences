Title: Lim Chee Aun: Bridging Connections - JSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-17
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	We always hear about the word "community" all the time, from companies, meetups, and sometimes groups of like-minded people. It has quite a broad meaning yet pretty vague at the same time. Iâ€˜ll walk you through my personal experience in defining the true meaning behind all of this.

Chee Aun is a Front-End Engineer from Malaysia, and currently based in Singapore.
He enjoys working on many side projects, like HackerWeb, Life and BusRouter SG.
He also organises KopiJS, a casual social gathering for engineers, designers and makers in Singapore.

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,180
time so they print disc your face on the

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,689

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,720
kind of nice and you know if you want to

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,259

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,600
cafe and some of you might have seen on

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,040
TV which is kind of weird I have to

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,390
speak mandarin i'm not really good in

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,610
speaking Mandarin even though I'm

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,829
Chinese but yeah some of you might yeah

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,020
this is like on TV interview kind of

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:02,490
thing some of you might have seen me on

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,670
a really huge slide my god yeah so so

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:09,319
this is dr. yeah Ibrahim he's like the

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,710
minister of communications and something

00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,320
some very important like

00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:18,250
in Singapore so and then somehow you

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,830
just put my face on that huge slide and

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:24,580
then that's like my my colleague I said

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:28,570
wow I'm chance so big yeah it's a pretty

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:30,700
weird comment so I'm from Penang you

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,310
know a place where all the good food are

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,460
in Malaysia and then I kind of like work

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:39,760
and study in KL for like four years and

00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:43,240
I'm here in Singapore for like roughly

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,370
seven years so I'm quite kind of like

00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,470
you know like feels very local here yeah

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,600
and yeah so I'm supposed to be giving a

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,180
technical talk since the beginning of a

00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,860
year and then suddenly Thomas like Kylie

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,670
tell me to like hey you know you should

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,860
give a like a community talk you know

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,710
like last talk of the day community top

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,390
I'm like yeah cool cool cool yeah

00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,360
perhaps I should do that you know like

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:13,720
and then he invented this wood called

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,550
self reflect ability not sure if it

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,470
exists in the dictionary or anything but

00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:21,250
yeah it's kind of you know

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,140
self-reflection so the reason why I

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,810
think why Thomas asked me that because

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,720
I've been kind of like if you look at my

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,790
site this is like my blog archives so

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,020
I've been writing a lot of for this year

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:37,870
so this year is kind of like a year that

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:41,170
changes me a lot so I all I change a lot

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,540
yeah so I don't really write a lot kind

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,840
of i write once a year which is weird

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,970
but yeah kind of cool and then this year

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,830
I'm like whoa like building stuff blah

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,300
blah blah you know like designing stuff

00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,490
and i'll be building so many things and

00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,880
write all of them down all my procedures

00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:00,760
all my whatever you know details that I

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:04,780
can you know right out and now you might

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,600
notice that on the third blog post is

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,980
called being invisible so this is like

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,740
the the article that article that I

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:18,489
write their kind of light changes the

00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,900
people around me as and also myself so I

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,100
don't expect you guys to read this right

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,380
now because you probably take like 30

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,020
minutes it took me two years to write

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,539
this

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,870
and actually publish this I have the

00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:31,849
courage to publish it yeah so basically

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,830
you know I'm this the article about

00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:38,629
myself being invisible being ignored

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:42,289
being a nobody and I'm sure that some of

00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:46,610
you might might think the same way as

00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:49,940
well and don't worry am i'm watching so

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:53,659
I also built a website called like a

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,720
website with a project called life where

00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:58,849
it's kind of like I document i kinda

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,229
like open source my life so not only

00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:06,110
that I open source my thinking and my

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:09,199
feelings and stuff I also open source my

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:13,039
whole like events in my life kinda looks

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,210
like this so i registered life it was

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,430
pretty cool don't mean you know like

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,409
top-level domain called life so it's

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,110
like Cian that life so you can register

00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:25,550
if you'll be like this for that or would

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:27,139
yeah so yeah so it's just time lines of

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:31,099
importing events it's pretty cool you

00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:34,250
know like cuz as I grow older I start to

00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:38,419
forget things you know in my previous

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:41,840
life you years so disclaimer this is not

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:44,569
a technical top there's no codes on

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:50,060
these slides so no not really very

00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:53,419
JavaScript related mostly jazz you know

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:57,139
just non technical stuff so you know

00:05:53,419 --> 00:06:01,130
don't echo it's okay no worries but I'd

00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:04,819
like to tell stories so this is like my

00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:07,000
style of giving talks so i really like

00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:11,300
telling stories for some reason but yeah

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,680
kind of yeah anyway but first let's look

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,779
at photos so yeah just all this morning

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,419
Thomas I show this photo you know yeah

00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:21,919
this is like the typical group photo

00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:24,500
kind of thing right and then every time

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,840
you see like oh group photo and up here

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:32,060
like photo of a group of people this is

00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:34,370
like branch SG it's a local Singapore

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,980
meetup where it's not real meet up it's

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,640
like a hang out of pique off like like

00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:43,730
people of engineers designers and makers

00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:47,750
and anyone curious about the whole you

00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:51,430
know tech people in Singapore and we

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:54,080
just hang out in a cafe and and talk

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,630
basically we don't really talk about

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,150
that go stuff sometimes you just talk

00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,290
about life and stuff so it's kind of

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,210
cool you know like this there's no

00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:05,780
setting there's no agenda there's no

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:10,040
speakers there's no like free food you

00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:12,500
just go and get food yourself so this is

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,090
like two years ago pretty random you

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,590
know like just grabbing all these tables

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,130
and chairs and combine it together and

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:21,980
then we just sit and talk and this is

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,750
okay cool so whenever I look at photos

00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,460
of people it reminds me of photos of

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,050
like you know when I go to school and

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,210
then my teacher was tell me hey let's

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,640
take a group photo and I'm like oh okay

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,140
yeah now I know why you're likely right

00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,760
you know in school sometimes you take

00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,250
group photos and if you look at that

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:41,300
that radar is me so it's kind of is

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,010
always this kind of setting and every

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,870
time I look at group of like the photo

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,740
of like group people it always reminds

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,780
me like Kyle I ok so i watch any me a

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,130
lot and usually this this kind of thing

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,810
is always reminds me of so many things

00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,020
it reminds me of this reminds me of

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,270
school reminds me of things I watch like

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:03,310
most of my time so but what does this

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:08,180
mean right like it's just a photo and

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:10,910
and that's when you know like that's

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,250
when you know sometimes we have to start

00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,380
for a while and I think why we do all

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,260
these things right why do we take group

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,240
photos in the first place why do we you

00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,670
know go like to a place together and do

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,790
all these things together and I kind of

00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:28,990
I want to begin with the beginning with

00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:31,550
this wheel and begin the beginning so

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,430
basically start from scratch again like

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,890
why we do this in the first place so

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,930
this is like my story on how I get

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:44,840
started so first I would like to mention

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:46,430
this guy yeah so Chris Neil I'm sure you

00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,520
guys don't know about this is this

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,290
person yeah so Chris Neil is like

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,110
all right there like first internet

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,410
stranger who helped me so I'll never

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,630
forget this guy basically because I

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:02,390
literally he's like the first person on

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:05,630
the internet who actually like help me

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:07,310
doing stuff like I I push something on

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,050
internet like you know like upload

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,300
something on internet did something

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,300
wrong and he helped me fix it I'm like

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,800
wow like why why did he help me you know

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,720
I don't even know how it looks like I

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,020
don't even know his real name actually I

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,300
don't even know where he is strong like

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:26,110
seriously like ah and at that time he

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,190
you know like time people don't really

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,800
put their real names they always put

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,530
their user names like so he's user names

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:39,440
actually CDN and I don't even know what

00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:41,510
CDN mins yes so is this light looks like

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,420
a fish so if aunt you know I still don't

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,860
know how he looks like but he kind of

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,130
like you know changed my thinking like

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:51,260
why would anyone actually help me like

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,570
that kind of thing like a stranger

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,590
actually helped me like I didn't even

00:09:53,570 --> 00:10:00,440
ask for help but that moment was like

00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,270
really special for me and it's kind of

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,010
like you know if let's say you're on the

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,560
street and then like you fall down and

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,810
someone help you you can see the person

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,660
who helped you write but on the internet

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:14,540
I couldn't even see the face like

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,730
seriously okay I don't even know know

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,220
like who is this guy and always from

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:23,270
stuff like that and it's kinda like you

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:26,570
know started the whole thing about why I

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:31,310
you know like why I keep asking why and

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:34,210
and this is the other guy David tensor

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:38,300
he is the first person inspire me on

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:39,710
like UI design and stuff so basically so

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,450
that's when I got started on like

00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,160
learning how to design stuff learning

00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,590
illustrator learning Photoshop learning

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,350
everything basically you know it's just

00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,780
it's just always this starting part like

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,400
people who inspire you and then you just

00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:56,590
start doing things and then it just

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,590
happens and then anyone remembers this

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:04,710
obviously this is not CSS comp so yeah

00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:09,060
but anyway so CSS H is the first website

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:11,880
that inspires me to learn CSS and no I

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,160
never forget this and that first demo

00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,180
the complex spiral demo is so cool like

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,520
seriously so cool at that time it's kind

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,730
of like it's a background image CSS

00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,880
technique carding now it looks kind of

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,000
plain kind of you know not so special

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,610
anymore but at that time is like a

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,350
website that inspires myself inspired me

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:39,390
and also a lot of other people and then

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:42,300
that's yeah the support is also one of

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,370
the sites that inspired me a lot of

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,020
articles not just about CSS but also

00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:50,610
about JavaScript web development

00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:52,590
everything and it looks kind of kind of

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,150
kind of kind of weird now but yeah it's

00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:57,210
pretty clear that time it's like the

00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,590
colors and all that stuff so and then so

00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,940
it's not just like website you know

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,530
they're not just about people it's also

00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,640
about the website sometimes you are

00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:07,470
inspired by all these things and then

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,980
I'm also inspired by this guy come off

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,570

so weird I'm not looking bad on the

00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:09,660
other side of this thing so it's kind of

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:12,120
funny so I'm just go to places you know

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,010
and I even blog about why I attend

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,870
conferences in after a while I kind of

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,850
like Oh finally I get it you know like I

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,730
finally get why people go to conferences

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:23,610
I finally get the reason you know all

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:28,830
the secrets all the tips and tricks on

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:32,000
good conferences and then so I kind of

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,430
like you know learn a lot of things

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,430
I learned a lot of things I asked a lot

00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:39,530
of questions and this is pretty cool you

00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,710
know like when you go to a lot of this

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:45,320
place these conferences or meet ups for

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,690
like the past few years you start to

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,670
know more things while I started no more

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,810
things I find out how people organize

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,130
conferences and events and meetups I

00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,530
realized that there's so many little

00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:01,040
details that most of us don't really

00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:03,350
know and it's kind of cool you know like

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,450
obviously you know if you go to this

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,430
event you start to get to know more

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,950
people and then you ask them questions

00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:13,310
ask them where do they work where do you

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,020
leave you know like all these questions

00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,670
will start to get quite personal

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,600
sometimes and that's pretty cool you

00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:22,520
know like and you know and there are few

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,710
people who are like to mention which is

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:31,100
versus okay cyanea cyanea is a one of

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:34,340
the very popular people in in Singapore

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:37,510
I mean popular figure in Singapore so

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,970
she built a website called vsg obviously

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:44,630
some of you might know is basically like

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:46,760
I call this like a like a engineer thing

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,980
like when you see a problem you want to

00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,810
solve it so she kind of like see a

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,370
problem in the let people come Singapore

00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,230
and they don't know what events are

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,750
there so there's no like aggregated to

00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,490
have all events and then just like okay

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,890
let's build a website and I will get all

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:04,460
the events it's that simple you know

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:07,190
like basically it's just a website with

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:11,140
events listed for like the next few days

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:14,060
that's it and also like repositories of

00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:17,600
github repositories of people contribute

00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:19,340
to stuff in Singapore and then after

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,510
that you know she even built like you

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,100
know after all these years of

00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,050
aggregating all the state or she build

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,790
this website called data that we build a

00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,310
nice tree which is like a historical

00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,050
data of everything of all the events in

00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:33,380
Singapore and all that stuff you can

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:35,630
play around with it and then a second

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,480
person is michael chang you know this is

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:40,429
like a must know guy if you're in

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,800
singapore you must really know him so

00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:45,360
he's like the organizer of PHP cough and

00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,660
he does crazy things

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,600
so he created this website called energy

00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,799
as the SG so engineer say is when you

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,260
look at it it's just a web site of

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,290
videos right like you know it's like

00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:03,290
YouTube yeah but if you see carefully

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:06,450
right these are recordings of talks of

00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:09,030
meetups it's kinda like recording so

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,309
every single top in almost every single

00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,420
meet up in Singapore so there's like a

00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,630
thousand two hundred and forty-one

00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:22,140
videos and what do these videos come

00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:24,840
from well he recorded himself and that's

00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:27,840
that's crazy like but now it's much

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,419
better because he finally like got some

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,850
volunteers to help him but I think he

00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:36,470
used to like do this by himself so kind

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:39,540
of like that's a lot of work just to

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,370
help other people you know like so it's

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,860
also like an engineer thing you see a

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,510
problem you want to solve it so most

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,450
people come to Singapore do say that hey

00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,730
you know you got a lot of meetups but

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,980
like how do I see the videos of the

00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,200
previous speakers like I don't even know

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,540
like who actually speaks you know that

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,910
kind of thing so Michael kind of like

00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,970
okay let's let's do this you know like

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:05,100
let's record all the talks in all almost

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,900
all the meetups in Singapore and then

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,630
when people come we just tell them that

00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:15,780
hey we got reckonings of every single

00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:17,669
talk and now you have no excuse so so

00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:22,770
this two-person like has been like quite

00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:25,620
special to me and I at the end we got a

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:30,330
chance to organize this git branch event

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:37,049
together which is kind of cool quite

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:39,530
nice and it's it's a very special like

00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:43,490
thing for me you know like being able to

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:49,940
collaborate with the people who I

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:49,940
appreciate and stuff like that and okay

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:56,440
so I i just kinda I want to mention I

00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:59,500
really I'm really thankful to the option

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,270
because because of him I get to organize

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,640
my own meet up so I go to a lot of

00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:07,600
meetups and suddenly I organize one

00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,789
which is kind of kind of cool so for all

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,649
these years I've been like trying

00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:13,659
thinking of organizing a meter because

00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:15,580
it's kind of like you know I want to try

00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:20,200
but there's so many meetups out there

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:22,809
like haha man so co pjs is kind of like

00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:26,440
you know first copies like it's a word

00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:30,010
for coffee it's a local coffee thing so

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,200
when you order coffee it's like like

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,970
like you know like like the coffee that

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,620
you know right copy is like a local

00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,720
version of coffee so it's actually

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,659
different with different tastes

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:44,559
different flavors different portions of

00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:49,000
caffeine yeah and kind of like it's just

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:51,190
a play the word play kind of thing so

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,549
copy Jess you know like it's just a

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:57,880
social gathering no talks know anything

00:22:54,549 --> 00:23:01,149
no presentation no no no free food so we

00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,010
just go to a cafe and we talk so it's

00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:06,779
kind of like get brunch but smaller

00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:09,010
version of it so it feels cozier and

00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:12,010
smaller groups means you know you can

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:15,700
you know talk in a better way like go

00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:18,279
karting soco pjs or the website and we

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,549
go to a lot of pieces a lot of cafes we

00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:22,779
discover a lot of cafes we just

00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:25,630
sometimes so there will be a bunch of

00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:30,100
students from su TD Singapore University

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:32,950
of Technology and design okay and and

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:35,140
then sometimes you will be like like not

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:38,590
just JavaScript people JavaScript engine

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:40,630
is it can be like iOS can be anyone so

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,789
it's really open for any like-minded

00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:46,720
people and if we just hang out and drink

00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:50,049
coffee I think like Thomas appeared

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,510
twice i read you like it is a second so

00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:54,169
yeah so sometimes you just hang out and

00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,299
drink coffee and ring

00:23:54,169 --> 00:24:01,039
sometimes I like organized this special

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,210

can't I do this you know for for like

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:41,179
few months now sometimes I'll be like

00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:44,450
asking myself in a light why am I doing

00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:46,879
this so I kind of like so there's a

00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:51,320
point of time I'll ask myself oh my god

00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:53,450
why am I doing this so if I you know and

00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,299
and I don't really have the answer I was

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:58,220
like oh why am I doing this is so tiring

00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:00,980
you know like you know I print teachers

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,529
i did i send these t-shirts to other

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,879
people and we have to like get the

00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:07,490
stickers and give you the other people

00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:09,620
way and then I got this part of

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,600
stickers and then it's all user ID to

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,850
print again and I oh my god this is so

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,800
tiring and then organizing meetup is so

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,800
tiring and going to meet ups is so

00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:22,190
tiring and I'm still doing this I don't

00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:27,710
know why and and I'm not the only one

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:31,880
actually there are a lot of people among

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:34,730
us perhaps like some of us would do the

00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,790
same thing you know like I know as I

00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:39,620
said I know a lot more people who do the

00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:42,500
same thing in the lights just on Michael

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:46,520
assignee they try to be website is to

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:49,220
help other people the record Michael

00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,440
record videos for other people some

00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:54,679
people like organized meetups for other

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,720
people and sometimes you know you get

00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,790
free food in meetups and sometimes you

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,160
ask yourself you know the free food

00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:04,550
where does it come from is it sponsored

00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:09,020
or is it from from your own money you

00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:10,790
know that kind of thing so after all you

00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:13,580
know like I kind of like found the

00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:15,650
reason yeah it's kind of like it's

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,380
pretty hard to find a reason for some

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:22,400
reason so it's kind of like very hard to

00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:24,350
find the purpose of what I'm doing it's

00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,420
kind of like like breathing you know

00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,530
like when you breathe you know you don't

00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,950
really think about why your brief

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:32,929
anymore it's like so so you know it's

00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:36,140
just it's like so natural you know you

00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:42,230
don't even think about it and the reason

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:45,710
is actually very simple so it's all this

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:49,400
a positive feedback basically just all

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:51,350
these tank use all this all this like oh

00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,750
my god you save my life kind of feedback

00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:56,420
that kind of thing you might get it from

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,850
from your emails you might get it from

00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,550
your facebook whatever you might get it

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,140
from anywhere or people write articles

00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,570
saying that you are awesome that kind of

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,910
thing so it's actually very simple these

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:12,740
two words means a lot you know like it

00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:14,929
kind of like keeps you going and that's

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,790
really cool you know it isn't you don't

00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:20,360
have to do that much you know that's why

00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:21,410
sometimes like it's great that we go to

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,930
organizers and

00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:25,670
say thank you to them and and that

00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:28,010
itself is kind of like enough you know

00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:31,340
like it doesn't have to be a lot it

00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:39,020
really means a lot it like actually that

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:41,600
two words seriously so give and take so

00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:45,530
sometimes I feel like some of us might

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,110
have had taken things for granted we

00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:51,110
always kind of I think most of some of

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:53,270
us like take a lot sometimes like you

00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:56,870
know when you use a javascript library

00:28:53,270 --> 00:29:00,260
you know like jQuery or you know react

00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:02,330
and all that stuff and sometimes like

00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,520
you go like that say like lodash or

00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,750
whatever all right all these websites

00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,490
you know they have really nice

00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:11,360
documentation really nice read nice

00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:13,880
really nice articles like well

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,270
documentation some people have podcasts

00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,370
or screen cars so many things and then

00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,840
sometimes you should just stop for were

00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,180
and think like who write all this

00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,880
documentation how much time did you

00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:28,780
spend writing all this documentation you

00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:33,410
know seriously and that's kind of like

00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:35,870
that's all right and and we start to

00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:39,830
like take these things for granted you

00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:43,700
know like all these things that people

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:46,880
do for us and we just use it and we kind

00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,800
of like don't give back sometimes so so

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,150
my point is that sometimes it's great

00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:57,620
that you we put some time into giving

00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:59,450
back sometimes I even a simple creating

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,030
a deep hot issue kind of thing you know

00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:04,790
if you found about report it if you like

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:07,660
see a typo and read me make a pull

00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:13,700
request sometimes that simple little

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:15,530
help makes a difference so you can do

00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,990
more than that you can give talks on

00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:20,120
whatever you know like yeah there's so

00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:24,400
many ways of doing things you can write

00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,400
articles help people teach people and

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:31,040
see like it's always like about the

00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,960
people for me I realized that almost

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,850

00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,840
individuals from vastly varying

00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,240
backgrounds and life stories with

00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,220
divergent trajectories and hopes but all

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,440
that didn't matter when we all breach by

00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,390
the work we all love to do me possible

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,039
by the lack of a physical distance

00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:56,489
across
