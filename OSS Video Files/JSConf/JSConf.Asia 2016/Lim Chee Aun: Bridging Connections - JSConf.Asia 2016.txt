Title: Lim Chee Aun: Bridging Connections - JSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-17
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	We always hear about the word "community" all the time, from companies, meetups, and sometimes groups of like-minded people. It has quite a broad meaning yet pretty vague at the same time. Iâ€˜ll walk you through my personal experience in defining the true meaning behind all of this.

Chee Aun is a Front-End Engineer from Malaysia, and currently based in Singapore.
He enjoys working on many side projects, like HackerWeb, Life and BusRouter SG.
He also organises KopiJS, a casual social gathering for engineers, designers and makers in Singapore.


JSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 25+26 November 2016.
