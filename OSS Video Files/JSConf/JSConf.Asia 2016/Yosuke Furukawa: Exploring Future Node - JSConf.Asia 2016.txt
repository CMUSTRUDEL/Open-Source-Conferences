Description: 
	In this talk I want to take a look at the current and future versions of Node.js and touch on the following items:

- Node inspector
- Internationalization support
- improving stability
- improving performance
- ES2015+
- ES Modules interop
- HTTP/2
- Web Standard
- Async Hook
- isTypes

Yosuke leads the Japan Node.js User Group and is an organizer of NodeFest. Yosuke has an interest in ESNext, new protocols like HTTP/2, WebRTC, and testing tools. He built the tower-of-babel, ES2015 tutorial tool and is now getting into universal web applications using React and Redux.
