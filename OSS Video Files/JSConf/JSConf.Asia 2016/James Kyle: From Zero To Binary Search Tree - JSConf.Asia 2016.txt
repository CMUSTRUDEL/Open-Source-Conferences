Description: 
	We don’t have a whole lot of data structures here in JavaScript world, but there’s a whole world of super useful data structures out there. In this talk we're going to learn all about the fundamental data structures. Hash Tables, Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and Binary Search Trees, we won’t just learn them, we’re going to build them. When we’re done you’ll be impressing all your friends with your mad structured data skills.

James is an engineer at Facebook as well as a core contributor to projects like Yarn, BabelJS and Lerna. Outside of work James is trying to make computer science more approachable to front-end developers.
