Title: Alex Gouaillard & Daniel Burnett: Evolution Of The Web - JSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-20
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	The web has disrupted the way developer approach software development. It is Fast, almost FTL. It’s not rare to hear people saying they want their own project to scale like the web, and to evolve as fast as the web. But how does it evolves so fast without being (too) chaotic? The W3C, short for world wide web consortium, is the body in charge of defining the web, the JavaScript APIs that all applications (wether browser or framework rendering web pages) should support to be web-compliant. That process is not well know to web developers which is a pity as their feedback is THE MOST important thing in the evolution of the web. Two W3C Invited Experts will provide insights into the W3C. What is the process through which the web evolve? What are the advantages you, as web developers, could have by following the process, or even becoming an active member? How to make a difference? What is the difference in terms of evolution between the web and the internet? Both will provide feedback from their respective point of view, and will answer questions from the audience.

As a member of the W3C, IETF and IMTC, Dr Alex is an active participant in the WebRTC community. Among other projects he co-led the WebRTC-in-Webkit project and maintains his "WebRTC by Dr Alex" blog with the goal to reduce the barrier of entry into the field for students and individual developers. He holds a Ph.D. in signal, image and video processing at the French INSA and in his free-time helps his previous students from Harvard Medical and Pasteur as a Scientific Advisor to develop in-silico modeling solutions to complement trials of cancer drugs.

Dan Burnett is a web veteran who has been participating in the evolution of the web since its early days and has been charing severe of W3C’s working groups. He is the writer of the reference book on WebRTC.

I know I stand on the way between you

00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,330
and and and the party after that so I'm

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,000
going to try to be entertaining anyway I

00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,220
spoke with Tomas a long time ago saying

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,500
this conference is a great place to

00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,990
actually meet the web developers and we

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,270
wanted to interact a little bit more and

00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:41,090
let you know about all the web evolve

00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,070
right so I invited one of my mentor

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,440
Danielle Burnett that has been an

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:50,360
invited expert in a chairman for a long

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,550
time next slide then and what we really

00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,530
want to speak about today is free

00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:59,300
question right now was the web aney

00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:01,310
internet created next slide Oh does it

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,560
keep evolving well you saw a lot of

00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,840
example yesterday and today I SWAT least

00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,440
22 presentation today speaking about

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,450
HTTP to that was created in something

00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,220
called IETF and all the working group

00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,470
and so on and so forth so how does it

00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,690
work exactly you know can you not only

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,110
benefit from it but create the next

00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:24,680
version of the web html5 HTML 6 next

00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:27,170
slide and even better how can you

00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,299
actually take the control and go on the

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,850
driver's seat and say I want to be part

00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,590
of HTML 6 I have some very very good

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,960
idea and I don't want that to be on the

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,299
framework I want it to be the next the

00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,650
next web I want to make a difference i

00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,020
want to change the word and i want it

00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,790
better than flappy bird to write so

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,770
that's basically the free question we're

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:52,070
going to try to to address during the

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:54,080
presentation today we using a web RTC

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,960
technology right now which is part of

00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,479
html5 to screen do slides directly from

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,750
atlanta and danielle is going to join us

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,070
from there directly next slide that's

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,850
what i'm saying next slide all the time

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:10,429
he has a control so we are we my name is

00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:13,880
unpronounceable so everybody call me dr.

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:16,880
alex and i'm an invited expert

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,070
as ietf w3c and a few other standard

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,530
committee in the word with a speciality

00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,300
on web RTC and what makes me a little

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,920
bit different is I'm the only one from

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,830
Southeast Asia attending these meetings

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,150
and I'm based in Singapore so I wanted

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,980
to give back a little bit to the

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,700
southeast asia and Singapore community

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:40,700
and now i will let dan introduced

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:47,240
himself and we don't have audio wait

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:49,160
then we don't hear you so it's

00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,780
supposedly plugged in can someone from

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,780
the technical staff give us a hand here

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,670
good I look I got that here

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,180
go on diamond try again hi everyone you

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:22,750
know yet here's something we hear from

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:29,230
the back but not the beauty of

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:32,830
technology somebody running can you say

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,930
again yes we can hear him from the back

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:55,950
but it doesn't seem to be connected to

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:55,950
the speakers Cooper

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,580
that's

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:21,060
yeah this one so you're already on the

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:22,860
right one then do not sing but please

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,220
say something so they can taste the Sun

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:31,410
yes testing all right fantastic all

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:33,810
right it happens all the time when the

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,660
streaming is the local microphone does

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,690
is so there's a lot of things that

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,430
happen in a streaming of media audio and

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,350
video and most of the time the problem

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,400
is between the keyboard and the seat but

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:52,140
not always all right done all yours okay

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:55,140
yes so hi everyone yes so I've been

00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,610
involved with w3c and IETF two

00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,880
organizations I'm going to be talking

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:05,820
about today for for many years I started

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:09,290
in 99 and w3c and 2001 in ITF I've been

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,510
an editor of many specifications in w3c

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,990
currently one of the primary editors of

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:19,950
the WebRTC specification and and some

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,810
other other work going on right now but

00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:29,520
let's go ahead and move right on into

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:32,040
the presentation okay so the first thing

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,470
I wanted to talk about is something that

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,560
probably many of you know but possibly

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,830
not all of you people often use the term

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,320
web the terms web and Internet done

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,380
interchangeably yes we do not have the

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,479
slide on screen you did not have the

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,650
slides please can you scream you or can

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,650
you share you yes yes

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:06,639
did not share them this time not yet

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:09,190
yeah I saw myself for a minute that was

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:16,380
frightening can you please focus on the

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:23,410
slides okay can you see them now perfect

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:26,979
okay here we go alright so the web is

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:30,370
not the internet right the internet is

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:34,270
the plumbing it's all the stuff at the

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:37,000
low level that actually controls how

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:44,940
information flows from one place to

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:49,180
another so it's the plumbing HTTP https

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:54,389
email dns the internet protocol itself

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:58,930
of course tcp UDP all of these are

00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:04,570
internet level protocols the web is

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:08,949
about content primarily HTML I'll talk

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:10,659
more about that in a minute Alex do you

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,150
want to say something about the Rhine

00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:15,580
slightly and we did the slide with two

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,260
levels in mind the global level right so

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,270
you guys get the global process and

00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,729
everything and then in a different color

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,669
things that can be more of interest to

00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:27,280
the local people or the Asian community

00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:28,960
so the government of Singapore recognize

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,849
the difference between internet and the

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,190
web and has created two different

00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:35,110
agencies to actually deal with that so I

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,449
da is the one taking care of the

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,430
internet and the infrastructure

00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:42,130
including big data for smart nation in

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:45,070
Singapore and MDA is going to be the

00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:48,280
media development authority that take

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,050
care about the content and blocking some

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,360
internet site if they disagree with the

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,639
content and everything that is related

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,320
to multimedia application so when you

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,389
guys deal with that with the local

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,130
government keep that in mind even though

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:05,500
recently I think they fuse the two

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:07,790
agencies okay

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:12,910
so I want to just give very brief

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:15,770
history of internet and web so the

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:19,640
internet was started as as many of you

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:21,860
know probably as a US government Defense

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,920
Department project to connect

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:29,020
universities and the US government and

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:32,690
then it actually it grew rather rapidly

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:35,690
to be a set of a collection of different

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:39,530
networks and they quickly realized that

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:42,410
there was a need for a better way to

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:45,320
connect them together and that way was

00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:48,050
the Internet Protocol right so the one

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:52,360
that connects different networks so even

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:56,740
though today we think of the Internet as

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,960
one way basically a way for any computer

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,410
to directly connect to any other

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:07,670
computer it originally started as just a

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:10,460
way to connect different local networks

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:14,150
and actually that is what the internet

00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,800
is today despite our attempts to pretend

00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:20,470
otherwise with network address

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:25,210
translators and so on of course ipv6

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:30,740
promises the hope that we can still I

00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:33,860
guess we can go back to the original or

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:37,700
go go to a notion where you can connect

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,100
directly from one machine to another but

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,470
we probably will end up keeping gnats

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,730
and firewalls for all the wonderful

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:49,730
policy reasons that we know about today

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:53,330
so that's the internet it wasn't

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:56,510
actually until a good bit later that Tim

00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:01,580
berners-lee a researcher at CERN in

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:06,800
Switzerland created HTTP the hypertext

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:10,190
Transfer Protocol and HTML the hypertext

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,870
markup language what Tim realized he was

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:16,220
actually working with other researchers

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,870
and realized that at the time there were

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,590
different protocols for getting

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:25,490
different

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:27,200
of information ftp archie gopher these

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,590
were all different protocols for getting

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,170
information at the time and it was it

00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:36,400
was a nuisance having to remember which

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:39,340
protocol you were using when really as

00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,080
an end user all you cared about was

00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,180
being able to access information and

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,880
that was stored somewhere other than on

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:51,680
your machine so by creating this

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,930
standard protocol for fetching resources

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:59,180
and then creating a language HTML that

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:03,590
made it very easy to link to and

00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:05,750
reference resources and other places he

00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:09,590
dramatically simplified the use of the

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:12,860
internet so that's I think the main

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:14,840
reason why people in general refer to

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,970
these two as the same thing today even

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,570
though they're not and that's because of

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:23,090
what Tim berners-lee did now Tim

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,920
berners-lee did go on also to create the

00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,590
world wide web consortium which I'll

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:32,330
talk about in a moment so this is where

00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:35,870
the internet and the web came from but I

00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,520
guess a good question now is where does

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,100
it come from today what happens when

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,090
changes need to be made and the answer

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,830
is all of us we are the ones who make

00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,860
the internet we are the ones who make

00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:53,390
the web as you know the internet today

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:56,180
is not controlled by any one entity any

00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:59,720
one organization there are organizations

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:02,930
that have strong influence over some of

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,180
the architecture of the Internet but it

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,010
is all of the devices all of the

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,150
individual networks that exist around

00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:12,800
the world that make up the internet and

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,800
it is all of the content that all of us

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:20,630
create and all of you in particular that

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:23,330
is the that is the web but of course all

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:27,140
of this works because of standards that

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:31,750
exist and it is the standards bodies for

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,750
the internet and the web that

00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:41,870
define the protocols and the floor mats

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:45,320
that make things actually work so one

00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:49,100
interesting question something surprises

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:52,460
many people is how the standards

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,320
actually get enforced and the truth is

00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,290
they're they're not I'm going to be

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,640
talking about the organizations involved

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:06,580
in just a moment but these organizations

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:11,510
are are not official in the sense that

00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:15,320
that governmental bodies drive them or

00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:18,590
or support them actually the standards

00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,660
for the internet and the web are just

00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,000
documents created by smart people and

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,090
people use them because they're good

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,520
they're good quality I'm going so really

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:31,190
i'm going to interject here than to

00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,040
really rebound on that there is no

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:36,890
internet police there is no web police

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,840
either right and the fact the thing is

00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,640
the people that actually create the web

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,410
are people that are using it so they

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,230
have a tendency of doing the right thing

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:50,200
and i think again if I I have to give an

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:50,200
example that you saw today is HTTP to

00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:56,090
HTTPS really better than HTTP right is

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,510
really going to address a pain point you

00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:01,310
have today it's faster it's easier to

00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,980
use it has a lot of things that were

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:06,650
learned from HTTP and that evolved into

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,050
something something better and adapt to

00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,910
the current tool but for that to be

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,070
possible right we need to have feedback

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,710
from the people that actually use the

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,420
tool so we get back to that later but we

00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,160
need to know what the pain point hard

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,930
today with the current technology to

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,910
make the next better one right and

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:26,930
you're not going to use them because

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:30,140
they exist right they are a lot of RFC

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:32,240
so specifications are sleeping dormant

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,490
because nobody really use them and that

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,560
we pushed by the industry and there

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,320
others like HTTP to that really really

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,500
address abandon are going to be used and

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,819
half of the people including done in

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,789
myself that go to those committees on

00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:49,739
not paid to do so which is going there

00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:51,660
to do the right thing and because they

00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:56,939
believe in into making the web a better

00:14:51,660 --> 00:15:00,809
place with you feedback right the news

00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:03,689
rapportage exactly exactly there's

00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:07,369
there's no one who actually makes us do

00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:09,539
it of course there are as Alex said

00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:12,660
probably about half the people who are

00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:16,109
there are there not because they have a

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,929
specific company position to represent

00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:23,669
but they're there because they feel

00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:26,549
strongly about the the protocols and the

00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:30,660
format's doing the right thing this is

00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:33,149
really significant okay there are many

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,399
other skin standards organizations in

00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:40,879
the world probably the most well-known

00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:45,350
ones in the tech space are the ITU gsm a

00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:48,779
3gpp etc and these organizations create

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:52,159
very good and useful standards primarily

00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:55,499
for the telephony and mobile telephony

00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,839
industries but for the internet and the

00:15:55,499 --> 00:16:00,989
web there there is no governmental

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:04,199
supported it really is just a group of

00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:07,109
nerds they get together and and try to

00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:09,269
make the right thing happen and so some

00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:11,339
people actually join some company

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:14,639
because of that beliefs everybody i know

00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:17,669
that work at mozilla which is a non for

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,859
nonprofit organization is participating

00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:21,899
to the specification to try to make the

00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:23,549
web a better place not because they're

00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,220
getting paid to do it that's actually

00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:28,289
the other way around so that's a really

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,999
exciting place to be to be surrounded by

00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:32,609
people that are not there because they

00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:34,919
paid not there because the company has

00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:37,319
an incentive or pushing their technology

00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:40,109
in one way or another but really trying

00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:42,629
to do the best thing for everybody out

00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:46,350
there that's really rewarding for an

00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:49,799
individual yeah at the last I ETF

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,439
meeting that they just happened recently

00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:55,289
I was talking with to first-time

00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:57,889
attendees one from Tunisia and one from

00:16:55,289 --> 00:17:03,109
Pakistan and both of them

00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:05,449
were really amazed mostly at the quality

00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:07,100
of the conversations that happen they

00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,220
were surprised to find that they could

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:13,250
walk into those meetings and be talking

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:16,069
with people directly at a deep technical

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:19,039
level that is exactly what you can

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,750
expect organizations like that because

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,159
again it is the people who want the

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,970
right thing to happen you know what's

00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:31,549
going on who will debate what should be

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:33,620
done and definitely if if an idea is bad

00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:36,440
you'll hear about it but if an idea is

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:40,159
good people will will listen to it as

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,830
well ok so the IETF the internet

00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:44,990
Engineering Task Force is the group that

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:48,130
defines the protocols for the internet

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:51,350
and it really is free to participate

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,149
there is a cost if you want to attend

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,360
the face-to-face meetings and that's

00:17:53,149 --> 00:18:00,080
just because it costs money to reserve

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:03,230
the space but keep in mind that the

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,080
reason for that is that there is no one

00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:10,070
company sponsoring the entire event they

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,620
do get corporate sponsors but the core

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:16,250
of the meeting itself is supported by

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:18,049
the fees that people k to attend and

00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,110
that's only when you attend the

00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:23,149
face-to-face meetings actually all of

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,639
the work is done or the majority of the

00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:28,330
work is done on the mailing list yeah

00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:30,860
the remote one seat the remote Pacific

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,139
participation to IETF is free there is

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,240
no membership fee and everybody

00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:36,830
represent only himself right so you

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,899
don't represent a company or anything

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,760
and really the the idea behind that is

00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:43,370
the Internet is free and everybody

00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,919
should be equal in voicing which we

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,809
should go ITF meetings are the only

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,340
meetings where you are maybe thirty five

00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:51,830
percent of the audience which are

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,220
actually students that take the

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:57,679
opportunity you having those meetings

00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,919
locally to learn from from other people

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,289
and to learn how it happens I etfs that

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,360
rotation rule where you're going to have

00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:08,149
three meetings a year and one meeting

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,650
per continent to give everybody almost

00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:12,330
equal opportunity to at least one

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,090
so you're drawing the meeting and learn

00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:19,740
and participate right everything else is

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:22,800
done online for free right at them the

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,380
main reason front of these place to face

00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,140
meetings is to get to meet other people

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,900
working in your area and in other areas

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,660
so again that's not where the majority

00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,100
of the work happens but I would

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,050
encourage you if you've been

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,640
participating on the mailing list for a

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,230
while definitely get started on the

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,060
mailing list but if you've been

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,490
participating for a while on the mailing

00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,710
list you might want to try attending one

00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:51,150
of the meetings just to give you another

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:54,810
example of how hard the IETF tries to

00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:58,320
make it easy for any person to

00:19:54,810 --> 00:20:00,510
participate there's one one thing that

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,810
people do at meetings that seems strange

00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:06,840
you to most first-time visitors and that

00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:11,640
is when it comes time to vote or get an

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,440
idea in in the room how how people feel

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,780
about perhaps one approach versus

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:20,490
another approach instead of actually

00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:22,560
doing a vote the IETF takes a hum and

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,950
that's where they just ask each person

00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:29,220
to hum for what their for their choice

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,470
and they did that because when they

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,900
early on when they had people raised

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,900
raised their hands to indicate what they

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,610
were interested in they found that if

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,260
someone was sitting there let's say

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,980
you're a technical person attending and

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,540
your boss is also there with you you

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,120
might have a different opinion from your

00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:52,320
boss and you might be afraid to raise

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:54,420
your hand because you you might not want

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,880
your your boss to see that that's your

00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:02,100
opinion because it might not be

00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:04,410
considered appropriate by your boss but

00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,200
when when people home it's very hard to

00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:09,030
tell where the hums are coming from so

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,370
that was actually done specifically to

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:14,610
make it so that you can have your vote

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:17,490
count and have it be anonymous just to

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,920
guarantee that you actually get the real

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,290
opinions of the people in the room now

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,120
again it's only what happens on the

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,800
mailing list that's official but

00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,730
that can be good for getting a general

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:35,550
idea for for which approaches people

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:38,910
prefer now what is the IETF do a guide

00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:40,890
TF creates rfcs requests for comments

00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:45,420
another funny name basically that's the

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:48,030
end stage process in the IETF is the

00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:50,190
request for comment I'm not going to be

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:54,300
talking today primarily about the IETF

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:56,760
process I wanted to to focus more on the

00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,520
w3c process but Alex maybe you could say

00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:03,270
just a little bit about this right the

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,430
good news is I told you once every year

00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,800
you have free meetings right one in

00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,660
every continent and the last one is

00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,110
always in Asia and it's been

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:16,080
traditionally in North Asia so far it

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:18,630
was in Beijing the year before it was in

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,430
sayville two weeks ago next year is

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:22,650
going to be in Singapore right and

00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,170
almost fully found it so everybody that

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,750
is in Southeast Asia will have something

00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:30,510
more local to actually go to and

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,790
interact with all the people that create

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,070
http/2 and create all the cool

00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:37,470
technology that you saw example of today

00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:39,690
so that's a great opportunity to

00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,060
actually go and mingle with people and

00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,890
ask question it's not every day that you

00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,590
can actually see it another coffee with

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,870
a chief architect of Microsoft edge and

00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,780
and that kind of people and ask them any

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,790
question about not what they did put

00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,250
why'd they did that today you so a lot

00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,350
of example of what you can do with HTTP

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,000
too but then you don't know why they

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,620
make this choice and not another choice

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,020
what are the next feature and swans

00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,820
those guys can answer those question

00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,920
right so I think it's a great

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:12,330
opportunity and I encourage everybody to

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:16,950
go there next year november and raffle

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,570
hotel thank you since this is a

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,030
developer conference i want to talk more

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:24,530
about w3c now so the world wide web

00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:26,970
consortium is the one that defines HTML

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,580
membership is officially by company but

00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:33,770
remember participation is free on the

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:37,180
mailing list there is one global

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:39,760
combined meeting a year all the tea

00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:42,250
but there are typically weekly calls and

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,940
other face-to-face meetings for the

00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:51,520
individual groups what w3c as is to

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:54,340
create recommendations so in w3c if you

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:58,240
have an idea you can actually go and

00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:01,750
create a community group you need one

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,320
member of w3c to support you and then I

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,670
met other people beyond that who express

00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,250
interest in it but with that you can

00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:11,950
create a community group no cost to you

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,230
mailing list only but it's a great place

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,530
to discuss now the moment you want to

00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:19,750
actually create a standard you need to

00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:22,590
move on to the standards track and for

00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:25,870
that you need a officially created

00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:28,540
working room I fink then Gabby Tracy I

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,400
think people don't stress enough the

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:34,180
wonderful tool the community group is

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,670
and I want to give a few example people

00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,190
in in Japan say a would like to see

00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:42,670
about IPTV or we want to see about a

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:46,060
media display web in vehicle in cars

00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:48,160
right or in sub when things like that we

00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,960
don't know yet if it's going to be

00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,360
interesting we just want to work create

00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,160
a group and be recognized you can go

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,350
ahead and create a community group in a

00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,370
few weeks you won't be able to make a

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:01,840
standard yet but you can do all the the

00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:04,030
preparatory work for standard if you

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,370
want to and that allows you to have the

00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:08,500
full weight of the w3c behind you and

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:11,710
the full organization with people that

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,260
can help you actually prepare organize

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,210
go in touch with the industry and so on

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,850
and so forth so community group are

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:22,480
extremely cheap to organize their not

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:24,370
limited to any ID that's really a great

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,210
introduction for people to have an ID

00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:29,230
and would like to learn or explore or to

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,970
work with the with the standard

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,770
committee and the industry that's

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,770
something that can be done in a in the

00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:37,570
scope of a school program with the

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,740
excellent University we have here in

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:41,470
Singapore I think that's something

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:45,370
that's really underused today and it's

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:48,330
free absolutely and in fact it's what

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:51,330
w3c is encouraging people to start with

00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:53,380
w3c is more and more ass

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:56,560
individuals with ideas to start

00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,180
community groups and then only request a

00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,510
working group once they've gotten to

00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:04,450
where there is very clear clear

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:08,500
agreement on a path to proceed within a

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:10,210
community group so officially I'm not

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,740
going to go through this in detail there

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:17,080
are basically two main group stages in

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,030
the standards process there's working

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,760
draft and then there are various stages

00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:23,170
of the recommendation the working draft

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,200
stage is when you're working on the

00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:29,230
document but at some point you think

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,030
your document is complete and now you

00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,440
need to just demonstrate that it can be

00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:36,100
implemented and that's the candidate

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,590
recommendation stage so the two main

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,840
areas you'll see documents in or the

00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,660
working draft stage and the candidate

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,250
recommendation stage there's a proposed

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,650
recommendation stage which is mainly

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,270
just like a one month placeholder before

00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,850
it goes to recommendation to make sure

00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:53,110
nothing is is fully broken but just

00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,520
think of it this way working draft

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,470
you're working on it trying to get it

00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,820
technically complete and candidate

00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,560
recommendation is when you're trying to

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,350
get implementations to demonstrate that

00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,540
it really does work now unofficially of

00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:06,460
course the real process that you're

00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,410
steadily increasing mindshare and that's

00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,660
why you begin with a community group you

00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,820
give people interested agreeing on what

00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,580
the real problems are and what direction

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,530
might be for solution and then in the

00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,660
standards process you actually begin to

00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:22,360
involve wider and you get wider and

00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,760
wider involvement from other groups

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,100
besides yours to make sure that you're

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,050
not going to break anything in the

00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,490
standard and it's very important to

00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:36,240
understand that it's only those who

00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:39,010
actively participate that matter Alex

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,620
had pointed out here in the WebRTC

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:44,680
working group there are 88 people

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,330
registered in the working group but only

00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,270
about 35 show up to the face-to-face

00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:51,880
meetings and there really are only 10 to

00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:54,310
15 who are actively participating in the

00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,110
decision so those are the people who are

00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:58,270
driving what happens and that's the

00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:01,180
that's the important point we want to

00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:04,889
make today Google Mozilla Microsoft and

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:08,529
Apple know best right

00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:10,179
well no okay they think they do I can

00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:12,849
tell you that for every group that I've

00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:15,179
been in that those companies have

00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:17,919
participated in and that's everyone I

00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:20,830
have heard a statement from each one of

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:25,749
them at some point we know what

00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:29,169
developers want so trust us if you

00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:31,119
disagree at any point then you need to

00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:33,519
participate we really need more

00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,889
developer feedback that's just crucial

00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,259
in order for this to work out of the 10

00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:44,590
to 15 people who are actively working on

00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:46,389
web RTC i would say that maybe one isn't

00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,570
developer is an active developer who

00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:52,090
does not work for a company that is that

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:55,359
is implementing the specification it's

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:57,639
actually funny to see those four browser

00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,470
vendors claiming that they know what the

00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:01,869
web developer one more than more than

00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:04,330
the developer themself especially when

00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:07,059
they disagree with each other right when

00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:09,639
multi aware especially when google goes

00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:11,379
frontal with with Microsoft and start

00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:13,929
saying I know what the devs want no I

00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:15,580
know what the devs want and they have

00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:17,889
different opinion but at the end of the

00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,799
day that's that's really that's really

00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:22,269
something we worried about by we I mean

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,690
the people not working for a browser

00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:27,249
vendor is that we lacking enough

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,109
feedback from the people that are

00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:30,999
actually using the technology and it

00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:33,190
should be the first one that matter

00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:35,710
which is you and that's really the main

00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,090
reason why I reach out to Thomas and say

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,059
I would like to make that presentation

00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,919
and tell the guys guys you can you can

00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:47,499
actually come and have fun with us and

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:51,460
make a difference we need you right yeah

00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:53,649
so Alex go ahead you wanna say yeah I

00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,929
mean so that's like contributed that the

00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:57,879
thing is it's it's actually easy to

00:29:55,929 --> 00:30:00,759
follow and contribute right all the

00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:03,249
mailing list of free the process is easy

00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:05,859
the process used to be very complicated

00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:07,509
to actually change the specification the

00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:10,269
working draft and so on now we're using

00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:13,470
Geeta right so your pull request away

00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:18,330
from contributing to HTML 6

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:20,909
Oh long do we have all right 20 where

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:25,289
the editor hi so you have two websites

00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:29,179
the w3 org and the IETF dot org to

00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:32,610
actually go and document more next slide

00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:35,070
but you know most of the evolution is in

00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:37,049
the public domain most is free as in

00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,659
freedom and free as in beer you don't

00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:42,600
need to pay and you do whatever you want

00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:44,039
and we really need you right so if you
