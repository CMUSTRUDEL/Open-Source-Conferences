00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:13,979
introduced from underwater

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:48,770
sometimes it's really hard to organize a

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:51,200
conference with it I haven't had an

00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:54,610

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,810

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,240
Singapore super glad you're all here I

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:31,420
hope you'll be excited can I hear you a

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:34,210
little bit okay great I can't believe

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,310
we're here five years was definitely not

00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:39,550
what I set out for when we started in

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,630
2012 with the first jazz camp and I

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,200
don't know if you know the story behind

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:46,660
it it was a friend of mine Sebastian and

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,340
I who decided to create a community

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,870
conference because we didn't know where

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,430
all these developers were in Singapore

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,959
we couldn't find them like we found

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,350
ourselves here working with web

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,150
technologies and where we were coming

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,280
from from Europe like we knew a lot of

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,050
people doing this but here somebody seem

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,760
to be creating websites they're all over

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,670
the place but we had no idea where there

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,230
were so we thought okay let's create a

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,800
conference and see who all these people

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:17,320
are and turns out 300 people actually

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:21,820
showed up and I wanted to show you a few

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:24,519
pictures that we have from then and this

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,739
is it still true as it was in 2012 we're

00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:33,550
still the closest JavaScript conference

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:35,680
to Java still holds true so this is 2012

00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,920
this is the humble beginnings how it

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,530
started with a few friends of mine and

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,940
we pulled up some inflatable palm trees

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,709
and thought let's do is our school

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:51,670
conference this is how it looked 300

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:54,250
people showed up and a few things you

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,860
might actually still see at jay's convey

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,930
sure this year the Jimmy monkey flac in

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,519
the back there they're the same guys

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,110
doing the coffee for you today and it

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:07,450
still is good and we had a surprising

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,489
amount of great people coming by from

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,549
all over the places judge me to join

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:15,100
doesn't 2012 and Joshua Joshua are you

00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:19,209
here today to risk you for CSS come for

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,549
sure yesterday and he stuck around to

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,470
can you wave there in the back if you

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:25,390
have a good Wi-Fi connection today it's

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,430
because of Fred who did it the first

00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,289
year and he actually build

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:33,190
more company around providing Wi-Fi for

00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:34,870
events after this and this guy maybe

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,729
he's already in the audience he is also

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,470
one of the guys who stuck around he gave

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:42,009
one of the first talks the one in the

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:44,650
back yawn he's going to give a talk

00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:46,210
about Hardware this year again I think

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,860
it's his third talk at chess conf Asia

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,050
so we have a lot of people that stick

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,759
with us I think Simon is he already here

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,889
too he's going to do talk later after

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,690
lunch like he's also one of our

00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:59,590
favorites like I think this is going to

00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:01,509
be his fourth talk here like yeah last

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,610
year I told him Simon I can't have you

00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,919
on every year like we need other people

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,330
to and then he came and gave a lightning

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:13,270
talk in the break as an audience member

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:17,050
so the whole team 2012 which I couldn't

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:20,320
have done it without that's how he

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,509
started the first 300 brave souls said

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,139
thought yay conference in nature sounds

00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:28,509
great let's go that was the year

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,949
afterwards that was in Manila was

00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:31,570
slightly smaller in back then I was

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:33,340
still naive enough to think it would be

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,960
easy to just have a conference travel

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,479
around Southeast Asia and be organized

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,590
in every city every year it was really

00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:46,810
tough but it was a great event

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:54,039
afterwards 2014 slowly growing that was

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:58,060
last year 2015 5 years can I actually

00:05:54,039 --> 00:06:00,460
see who was here 2012 just a show of

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,789
hands I see young yeah that's correct i

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:07,180
see CJ we have a few souls that came who

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:09,940
is here all five years actually I at

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,550
least saw two names coming up and I did

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,259
the Kree myself and I wonder if they are

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,710
here already and can identify themselves

00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:19,659
I think that's super cool that we are

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,550
able to do a conference like this year

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:24,400
of the year and have so many people show

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,080
up and the main idea behind it is still

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,759
the same we still want to know where all

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,270
these web developers in Southeast Asia

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:34,449
and want to talk to them and make sure

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,760
that we create more people that want to

00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:37,290
come into web development

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,600
and create a welcoming community around

00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,310
it and that's kind of the word that I

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,710
want to stick the conference around is

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,810
the community building aspect of it so

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,550
during the next two days make sure you

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,680
find as many interesting people to talk

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,990
to that you can possibly find we're

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,940
going to have life chest tonight where

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:58,200
there's going to be great performances

00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,210
and together with a bunch of drinks so

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,560
you can talk and roam around and then

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,350
George our script giving your

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,910
entertainment time and we're going to

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,950
have the five-year anniversary party

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,720
tomorrow at the great escape where you

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:14,070
are happy to join in and pay with your

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:16,290
brackets for drinks and just make sure

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,030
you go home with the most learnings in

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,430
the most new contexts that you can

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,260
possibly find I also want to give out a

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,390
shout out to the good guys from Palo IT

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,880
who are participating in deaf West Asia

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:30,300
and they had a workshop last weekend

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,890
where I think eight to ten people that

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,050
just found themselves i signed up

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,210
randomly i had to create a mobile app in

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,850
two days and they actually succeeded in

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:42,660
doing so it's online as a mobile website

00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:44,340
on conf match com so you can try it out

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,990
it's a very simple thing is an app with

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,790
your github and you can put in your

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,260
interests and see if you find other

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,080
people that you want to connect with in

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,450
this event or other deaf fest event that

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,850
fest came actually about three years ago

00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,110
as a simple list of events that happened

00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,640
around the conference because people

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,130
were with bothering me is like can you

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,240
put my event on your website for the

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,680
conference because I want all these

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,630
awesome people to come to my event too

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,480
and eventually create ad FS as a

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,070
separate website that would list all of

00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,020
those events and last year grew bigger

00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,480
and bigger this year we have 21 events

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,360
more than 1,200 registered attendees for

00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,210
all these events this is I think the

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,490
16th or 17th event as part of deaf fest

00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:26,010
this year and FS has now an official

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,500
vision to which is to enhance digital

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,230
expertise in Asia emphasize on

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,140
collaboration and build community so

00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:37,039
with all of this community talk let's

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,099
get some more community talk

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,099
