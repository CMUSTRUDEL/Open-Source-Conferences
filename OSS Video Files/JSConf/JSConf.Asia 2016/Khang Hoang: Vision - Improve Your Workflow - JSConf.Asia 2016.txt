Description: 
	Remember the times when you needed to hardcode an API response because the actual APIs are still to be implemented? Making it impossible to simulate edge cases with the real APIs or the network? The wait is over! Khang has created just the tool for those situations.

Khang works as React Native developer at Employment Hero by day. He is a JavaScript hacker & open source contributor by night. He organizes the React Native facebook community group for Vietnam.
