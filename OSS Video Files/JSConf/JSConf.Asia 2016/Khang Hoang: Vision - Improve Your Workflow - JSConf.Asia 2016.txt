Title: Khang Hoang: Vision - Improve Your Workflow - JSConf.Asia 2016
Publication date: 2016-12-19
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	Remember the times when you needed to hardcode an API response because the actual APIs are still to be implemented? Making it impossible to simulate edge cases with the real APIs or the network? The wait is over! Khang has created just the tool for those situations.

Khang works as React Native developer at Employment Hero by day. He is a JavaScript hacker & open source contributor by night. He organizes the React Native facebook community group for Vietnam.

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:27,480
hi everyone so I'm calm I'm from Vietnam

00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:29,849
little bit about me I am full time react

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,780
native software engineer for a company

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:36,719
named employment hero which is HR

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,370
platform from Australia before that I

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,570
make iOS app and build a server by

00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,760
nodejs

00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,910
so I'm here today to share with you guys

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,239
about tools that I'm curry working on to

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,570
serve my daily problem when I do the

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,879
coding please notice that I mentioned I

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,020
will mention a lot about react react

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:05,280
native Redux but if you from different

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:10,409
backgrounds like angular ember or view

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:13,560
you see tech benefit form the top so

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,900
gallant they get stuff from my tools

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:22,640
that I used in my current workflow so

00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:25,350
this is tools that I use daily because I

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,579
react native developer so I new chrome

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:33,000
dev tools to debug a new live load as

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:36,390
well as react they're tuned and we redux

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,860
they're tuned to time travel and the

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:44,340
react hot daughter you know that tool

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,509
doesn't exist in vacuum they exist you

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,170
solve the problem

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,720
and when I say tools I mean the tools

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:56,790
that help us to improve our productivity

00:01:51,720 --> 00:02:00,860
and keep our sanity thing like when we

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:05,070
change UI the page will immediately

00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:08,970
update to reflect the changes or we can

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:13,390
easily spin point on the bug stuff like

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:17,409
that there's more tools like run and

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:20,560
webpack crucify grown-up chairs

00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:23,349
s-sarah but is that there are tasks

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,849
runner and a bill tooled and they are

00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:31,959
not the topic so i get started

00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:35,379
michael of time when I work on my first

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:39,849
website it was a single page application

00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:42,810
that we completely on jQuery and the

00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:46,569
whole page with a check at the point

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:50,709
2010 people thought that I crazy because

00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:54,519
no one did that except for some big guy

00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:59,079
like Facebook Google but I did it anyway

00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:02,260
and my first experience when I try to

00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:06,299
debug is something like this

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:11,650
I knew this alert a lot when I try to

00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:16,569
debugging like to understand what is a

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:20,829
synchronous thing come back and if I

00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:24,400
look but you know it's work right we

00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:28,810
tried to I try to to file the bug and

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,180
it's work but it's not good it's not

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,810
good and then I knew about chrome dev

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:39,129
tools and it really makes my life easier

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:41,799
so this is the chrome dev tools you can

00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:45,939
do a lot of do a lot of stuff on this

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:48,220
you can set the prac ponds check the

00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:50,909
corn-stack debug with a meaningful

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,099
meaning my code by using the source map

00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:57,370
beside that is has many feature like

00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:59,879
network performance timeline and let you

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,609
know about the information of your page

00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:06,030
how I get render JavaScript and see

00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:10,180
there's performance and of course is

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:13,680
expecting Dom and star tinker matter

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:17,079
over time but this was a problem that

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,440
whenever I change the code and it

00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:24,760
suppressed fi to reverse the page which

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,820
for me is very tedious thing and then I

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,360
find out the

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:35,800
the app named live reload it's claimed

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,050
to be a supreme developer to wonderland

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,350
a happy land where the browser don't

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:46,180
need a refresh button so whenever you

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:49,270
change your file is we also refers your

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,940
web page and if you church change the

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,669
image URL or just a test

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:59,800
it just update immediately without fully

00:04:54,669 --> 00:05:03,370
refreshed your whole page and for your

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,699
information react native have the world

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:11,139
look live reload as a viewing feature

00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:14,620
and I'd use it every day so next let's

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:18,220
talk about we are kept tuned so this is

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:21,340
real depth in chrome attention you can

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,220
see that you can do a lot of stuff with

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:28,150
it you can see the hierarchy of your

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:31,419
react app you can treat it props just

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:36,160
stayed as well as the infer and listener

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:39,970
of your component and if you if you

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,630
redux you may not need but you know if

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:46,990
you if you use it there's a tool cone

00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:50,949
without step tool which allow you do a

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:54,610
lot of thing list it can lock your

00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:57,010
action in many form and you can see what

00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:00,099
action you just be patch with what

00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:03,820
payload and which part of your reduc

00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:05,169
star change by on that action there's a

00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,050
feature called

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:12,340
time travel which is a very cool one

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:15,090
that allow you to go backward something

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,460
like undo

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:22,120
like for example you have a login form

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:24,490
and you work and when you click the

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,620
login button the response from the

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,919
server it turns so fast then you cannot

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,800
see the loading indicator and what if

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:37,870
you just want to do a UI changes for

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:40,230
that loading indicator so just you time

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,630
travel then you can go back

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:47,010
like what so any point of time from the

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:52,169
past I will I will show you later if I

00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:56,760
have enough of time and then we have a

00:06:52,169 --> 00:07:00,720
library cone react hot reload

00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:05,460
you can see on the screen is how can how

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,760
I can enable it on react native so what

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,949
it does is that is leverage the web pack

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,740
called Mattoon do loads to allow you to

00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:16,530
treat your components without losing the

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,210
state of your apps for example if you

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,690
are walking on the pavement screen and

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,100
when you change is code I mean the

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,310
payment screen code

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:30,090
the app will update immediately and you

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:33,539
you still at the same screen but with

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,729
the newest code and you don't lose any

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:41,760
stay of your app and anything that you

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:45,090
input in the form still be there and for

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:49,500
me it's a big win because I don't need

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:51,780
to do a whole process like login pick up

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,880
the products and then go to the cart and

00:07:51,780 --> 00:08:00,110
then checkout fielding the building

00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:04,229
information to get on the payment screen

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:08,130
but they're more so let's say you are

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:11,070
feel developer or angular or amber there

00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:15,440
are tools that help you to make your

00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:21,030
life easier like future a step tool and

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:24,720
inspector angular every circle chair

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:27,120
step tool and a lot more each platform

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,490
and framework this has their own dev

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,710
tools which have developer is lease to

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,339
figure out what is the problem and and

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:40,770
how to fix it so the next question is

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:43,620
are we there yet so I mean when I say

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:46,800
that I mean are we happy with our our

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:51,390
our current workflow is there anything

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,510
that we can improve on it so the thing

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,380
about my workflow again

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:59,029
so I start with the mock-up like

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:02,300
designer give you a screen and then

00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:04,610
based on that screen I can make react

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,500
component react native components based

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,260
on that mock-up and then I will

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,649
implement some business logic and then I

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,800
turn on my hot reload so that whenever I

00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:18,100
change the UI called or the business

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:24,560
logic the app will change accordingly

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:27,709
without using state yeah and then when

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,260
the bug comes with just you chrome dev

00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:35,199
tools to to figure out how you can fix

00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:40,970
it and it's been pretty neat right but

00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:44,209
it's not this is one thing that we can

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:49,339
control is data from external services

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:52,279
for example response of an API call like

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:55,160
when we when you do a to do a pray you

00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,519
want to send a request to the server and

00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,639
then get a respond back and then render

00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:05,690
whatever the server sent back to you but

00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:07,459
you do not have the power to to decide

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:14,690
what is a response that you want to

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:18,410
forget and yeah there's a there's a walk

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:22,519
around solution such a we can have coat

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:27,050
the the data or we just use the mock

00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:30,620
server but those require code changes

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:34,250
and when you find yourself and ups with

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:42,019
you sitting back and forth between the

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:42,829
mouse server and the real API but how

00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:46,790
can we

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:50,420
so how can we simulate the very 8 cases

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:52,250
like when the user login 5 time we want

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,970
to show our error message from the

00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:59,750
server but do we want to just login 5

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:06,630
time to just see the error message no I

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:08,280
don't so I create a tools

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,780
actually it's a chrome attention and

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:16,950
named it reason here's what it looked

00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:19,280
like is there the gift I will play it

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,410
right now but what you are seeing is uh

00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:26,700
you can see that is the chrome dev tool

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:29,760
and the reason up here is a panel beside

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,340
of the source map and the control and on

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,610
the left hand side very dummy

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:39,360
Lucky's login page which allow you to

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:42,420
enter your name and is it is this in the

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,790
database is will redirect you to the

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,090
dashboard if not and just display the

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:50,400
arrow the first time I will try with the

00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:54,680
real API so it returned you and

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:57,780
authorized and then I turn on the mock

00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,750
and then when I click login there's a

00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:03,870
button the green one I can click on that

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:06,200
and change the response to whatever I

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,200
want

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:19,470
so why reason why I make this chrome

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:24,780
attention so with reason you don't need

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:29,750
to have code anything and you can easily

00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:33,180
to simulate the complex cases like

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:36,270
imagine that you need you have the form

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,870
and the first time the users submit that

00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:42,450
form the server will return you repair

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:45,360
time our error message at the five

00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:49,530
second but the second time it will

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,050
succeed how can you simulate that with

00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:56,700
your current workflow I think there's no

00:12:52,050 --> 00:13:01,890
way except you like change your code I

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:07,590
have caught it but with the reason you

00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:10,320
can just type out whatever you want so

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,230
it will help you to simulate the

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:18,570
responses the only limitation is your

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:20,460
immunity date imagination I think in the

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:24,870
future we

00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:29,310
and have the feature like those cases we

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:31,710
can name it is scenario and when we find

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:35,130
out there's a scenario that we haven't

00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:37,350
handled yet we can just export it I

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:39,450
spawned a scenario from the reason and

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,630
then send it back to the other developer

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,610
in your team or your p.m. and say hey I

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:49,080
think there's a case that we didn't

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:51,570
handle it properly and vision will

00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:59,480
cross-platform even with the react

00:13:51,570 --> 00:14:09,230
native okay so he's time for life demo

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:09,230
okay okay here we are

00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:18,480
okay can you see it right so this is the

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:21,750
example that I get from the Redux

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:27,420
response story so it's a very simple one

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:29,040
just just pull the latest news with the

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:34,830
keyword right here

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:42,570
forum graded so I will try to present

00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:45,300
again okay very fast okay I just proved

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:49,800
with you that is actually fetch form

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:54,600
ready server and now what I gonna do is

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:57,930
that I will try to modify the response

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:07,530
from the server okay how I can do that

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:10,950
I will turn it on and then I will click

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:14,450
the refresh okay so now you see that the

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:19,050
whole page is in the loading state and

00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:21,120
there's a green button that his name is

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,230
released the request with the ID of the

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,770
request and then you just keep whatever

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,770
respond that you want

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:46,169
okay here I copy sorry I will pass the

00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:48,339
contents after respond sorry it's uh

00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:53,169
there's something wrong with the

00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:58,600
response so it doesn't highlight and all

00:15:53,169 --> 00:16:04,199
the time okay that's right I think it

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,199
doesn't work because I miss something

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,769
no please

00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:23,009
okay so this one should be like this

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:32,970
No yes Wow okay this one on so sorry

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:39,750
about this

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:44,430
I just happened because I just copy and

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:46,800
paste it but basically what it does is

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,610
that when whenever I click return the

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,250
mock object is will respond the data

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:56,510
that I just enter instead of going to

00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,770
the greatest server and and fetch that

00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,340
how can we fix it

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,770
can you have one minute that I could lie

00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:08,480
to fix it it's very cool and I really

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,480
want to share with you

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:23,370
I are gonna do is I just checked the sin

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,309
tag because it's a JSON so if it's not

00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:34,860
in the correct format as we crash the

00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:37,970
app okay a lot of okay so it's there's a

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,830
lot of you know it should be like

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,620
instead of being like this is to be like

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:47,280
double collect this and because of the

00:17:43,620 --> 00:18:01,850
editor so we cannot change

00:17:47,280 --> 00:18:05,820
Oh actually we can yeah that feature

00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:08,940
okay so I will save this one for if you

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,540
have if you want to see it just comes to

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:15,510
me after this talk and we will I will

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,700
show you this demo because a pretty sure

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,669
that when I click return is not gonna

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,260
work so you have to option whether you

00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:24,780
want to return the mock object or you

00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:28,559
can forward it forwards mean that it

00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:33,059
will fetch the real API instead of

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:39,570
return your mouth later you have time

00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:41,910
for for me to fix it yeah I think a

00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:47,100
minute we have I kind of computers now

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:51,110
about the result okay I will try to do a

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:57,510
fast way I can I just want to bring out

00:18:51,110 --> 00:19:02,000
hello jazz conference give me one minute

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:02,000
if it's not that I just give up

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:16,200
okay so I will go to just one double

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:23,140
click on that okay

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:26,310
copy this vodka we crazy okay yeah we

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:34,260

00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:37,260
just hold on okay here okay

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,260

promise okay that back sooo you can

00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:40,800
