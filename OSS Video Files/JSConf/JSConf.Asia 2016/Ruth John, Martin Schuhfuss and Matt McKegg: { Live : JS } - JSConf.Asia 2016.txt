Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	Are you ready?! Are you really really ready?! You‘d better be cos it‘s { Live : JS } time! We‘re going to bring you JavaScript powered music, visuals *and* interactive lights! It‘s been a incredible day of talks, so grab a drink, relax and let Ruth, Martin and Matt entertain you: JavaScript style!

Ruth is a web technologist and Google Developer Expert. She likes to educate people about new web technologies and inspire them to try them, coming up with exciting and engaging ways to use them. Her favourite things include interactive audio/visual installations and 80s cartoons, usually at the same time!

Martin works as a creative developer at ubilabs in Hamburg, focusing on WebGL, Data-Visualization and interactive website experiences. In his spare time he plays around at the intersection of electronics and JavaScript and loves to connect random things from the physical world into the web.

Back for his second time at JSConf.Asia, Matt is a JavaScript hacker and backyard musician from Wellington, New Zealand. He is a lover of all things open and modular and spends most of his time pressing buttons of various shapes, sizes and colours. Sometimes these buttons make sounds.

projector everything that you just saw

00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:44,140
everything that we do here tonight is

00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:45,880
done with JavaScript so I know right so

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,979
before we start actually giving you a

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,200
show we thought what we'd do is just

00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:52,810
take you through very briefly every

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,850
single aspect of what you just saw so

00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,130
grab a tray I assume you got drinks

00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:02,020
outside at some war that's fine relax

00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:06,759
and enjoy the show and I'm supposed to

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:10,479
be starting my fix of the screen get up

00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:13,600
sweet it's gonna be fun right so yeah as

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:18,580
you may have gathered I make music and I

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:22,360
use computers to do that however it's I

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:26,980
can hide there I haven't even drank

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,319
anything it anyway okay all right sorry

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:34,240
I just we yeah we good we good ok all

00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:36,280
right so I got sick of making music with

00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,740
computers and I decided to make software

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,020
to make music with computers and I did

00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,060
it with JavaScript because javascript is

00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,959
the thing I know but I know what you're

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:49,510
thinking today I'm going to show you a

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,099
super simple turkey recipe that gives

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,739
you the most perfect delicious bird

00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:56,070
every time we'll start by tossing out

00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,240
the giblets

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,940
but we'll keep the Nick will be using

00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,730
that now for the stuffing will need 1

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,270
cup of celery 1 cup of carrots and X and

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,270
a dog

00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:33,560
why would you do that why on earth what

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:36,750
anyway I have a very good reason

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,950
basically playing computer music is

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:45,270
really weird it's it's a strange thing

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,980
so most of my life the last 10 years no

00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,630
not most my life almost the last 10

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,370
years i have been using computers to

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:56,850
make music in my bedroom and going from

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,620
composing stuff in a timeline to

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,720
actually trying to play a gig in front

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,000
of people it's something that every I

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,070
think pretty much anyone that's doing

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,090
modern music these days faces but

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,010
particularly people that are doing

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,940
entirely computer-based music with

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,320
they're not actually playing any

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,209
instruments themselves they're just

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,010
putting little dots on the screen and

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,870
they're tweaking parameters and it's

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,570
just it's just really strange for us to

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:22,590
try and play live and compared to

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,610
someone like a guitarist because what

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,320
they're doing on the album is really

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,240
similar to what they're doing on stage

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,440
they just playing the guitar and so if

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,090
they're on stage they play the guitar

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,100
people are like woohoo if they're on the

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,110
album then the recording engineers like

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,770
do that again but otherwise it's pretty

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:41,130
much the same so what are my options as

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,990
a musician if I want as a computer

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,270
musician if I want to actually play my

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,950
stuff for real to an audience well one

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,360
of them is I could just get some real

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,950
musicians to play everything for me and

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,650
I could be like the conductor or

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,060
something and there are a lot of really

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,560
cool electronic bands that do that so on

00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,210
the album it's just like one guy doing

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,490
everything or one gal but in the stage

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,590
they start getting some guy on the drums

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,910
and someone else on the guitar and some

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,060
of the sense and someone on the crazy

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,110
stuff and it's kind of cool but I think

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,310
you kind of get a different complete

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,110
different vibe from that and some of

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,220
this kind of better I mean why do we

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,250
even doing computer music which is just

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,100
play real instruments but the next

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:24,000
option of course is you can DJ it and

00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,330
this is more like exhibited as a musical

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,389
artist so rather than

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,739
just rather than trying to like recreate

00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,899
everything on stage it's like you know a

00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:37,289
painter isn't going to paint something

00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,300
every gallery it's they painted this

00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:40,979
thing in the beautiful little mentioned

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,599
somewhere up and he'll and then they've

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,099
shifted all this stuff into a beautiful

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:46,889
space that you can come view their

00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:49,319
painting and so I think DJ's are kind of

00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:54,300
doing that and this is my favorite

00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:59,309
example to welcome this gentleman to the

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,499
stage please give it up for darude so

00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:04,800
everyone is so hot to see this amazing

00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:09,319
musician perform have paid thousands of

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:12,779
dollars and learn miles or kilometers

00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:16,159
and here he comes is so cool this is

00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:22,529
darude darude is like the most amazing

00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:30,149
electronic artist of all time he's

00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:34,829
coming up on stage and what does he do

00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:37,199
are you ready for it he pushes play and

00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:40,319
the rest of this is just him going

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:45,349
height and lots of light show so Madden

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,349
has a really useful role for the river

00:06:50,090 --> 00:07:00,139
but that is not what I wanted to do for

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:02,520
vyas reasons maybe to some people so

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,720
really I was only one their option which

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,830
is I actually have to play everything

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,270
myself and I have and well I mean I'm

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,009
not really going to show you the music

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,960
that I've been that I used to make

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,150
because it's completely changed since I

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,940
started trying to play everything myself

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:23,130
but yeah it's if you want to find out

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,630
about that story you should look at my

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,840
talk I gave last year jazz conf there

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:30,539
was anyone here at last JS conf yeah

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,770
cool some people yeah you should look it

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,000
up because i'm going to explain what I

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,550
makes you doing so what I'm going to do

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,599
now is I'm just going to show you what

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:44,699
my JavaScript software does so oops I

00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,349
haven't get my web camera working and we

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:51,810
able to OB have yeah can you get a

00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:54,590
close-up of my hands sweet so I can just

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,590
play sounds

00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:09,030
instruments I can also play perfectly in

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,030
time with the beat

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:40,720
and then i can look whatever I've just

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:43,240
done and I can just build up whole songs

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,370
doing those things and so all of these

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,780
different colors represent different

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,730
sounds that I can trigger at any moment

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:52,360
that I want to and I can have as many

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,860
different things loaded and I can mix

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,980
between them kinda like it has somewhere

00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,130
between a DJ and a musician yeah so

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,960
that's pretty much how this all works so

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,210
I'm going to be doing this for another

00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,840
hour after this but without talking it's

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:10,420
gonna be much better thank you very much

00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,700
Matt so what you're saying is you make

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,420
music with JavaScript I do that's

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:19,360
amazing cuz I need music really yeah I'm

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,090
the VJ right you what now well it's a VJ

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,910
I know I get this question a lot so I

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:27,490
put visuals to music that's what a VJ is

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:31,270
I might need a llama in a minute so how

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:33,520
out of the audience waiting for that to

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:39,450
be ready yeah okay good who remembers

00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:48,400
this we're now it really whips the law

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:53,050
haha the best internet in heaven and

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:56,320
Eminem I honestly I'm taking that DJ

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:59,170
everywhere with me from now on no best

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,550
mp3 player of all time right for those

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,200
of you don't know it's a really really

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:05,830
light mp3 player for when we actually

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,630
kept mp3s on hard drives but this wasn't

00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,580
the best thing about winner this lovely

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,580
piece of software no no the best thing

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,010
about winamp was this the visualization

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,450
engine he remembers that so this was

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,190
actually a part of the software so you

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,440
could fire this up and it would show you

00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,660
visualizations that went in time with

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,660
the music this is probably the biggest

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,980
influence of any VJ of my generation we

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,360
used to sit there in our teenage years

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,620
and just watch it

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,589
like I wouldn't be caught if we could

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,860
make this ha funnily enough we can in a

00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:38,260
browser okay so the first thing you need

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,540
to create visuals in browsers to analyze

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,370
the sound so we can do that with the Web

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,930
Audio API it has an analyzer node that's

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,959
really cool so this is just a quick

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:49,269
example of what we can do this is mostly

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,769
sort of analyzing my voice now it's a

00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:53,290
little bit of latency cuz I'm running it

00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:55,800
within the slides so we just grabbed the

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,630
analyzer node from the Web Audio API and

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,430
all we're doing or we get back is an

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,200
array of frequency velocities all right

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,329
so frequencies that's low sounds too

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,579
high sounds and all it's doing is

00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:09,220
telling us what volume those frequencies

00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:10,990
are any given time so we can take that

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,149
data and it's just numbers we can just

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,350
take that data and do whatever we want

00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:16,060
with it and we can do that when they're

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,130
browser so you can use a whole bunch of

00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,540
sort of browser features so we can do

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,459
stuff on the Dom we can do stuff on

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,230
canvas we can we can do stuff with WebGL

00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:26,589
we can do whatever we want we can use

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,600
new features so one of the visuals do so

00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:30,730
at the beginning uses CSS blends and

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,740
filters which is nice these lovely

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,380
speakers here you saw some of them

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,209
earlier that's all blend modes that was

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,680
fun building that it's a little bit it's

00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:41,140
a little bit cranky unerring a bit it

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:45,100
was fun building it other things like

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:47,230
custom properties right so this is a fun

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,690
one this is JavaScript all up in your

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,810
CSS so what you can do is you can take

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,519
one of the frequency values pass it into

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,040
a custom property which is basically a

00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:00,310
CSS variable and pass it back into your

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,019
CSS right so we can do that here we're

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,640
using the get byte frequency data so a

00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,500
frequency data here is our frequency

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,720
data array and then we're just doing

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,060
document.documentelement style step

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,000
property and then the level there that's

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,130
my CSS variable and I'm just passing

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,860
that data back into my CSS so i can

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,720
change anything in the browser CSS wise

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,100
with that frequency data so i can not

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,730
only can I do it in my JavaScript I can

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,170
do my CSS as well that's fun so it's

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,850
pretty it's pretty easy to make visuals

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,230
I'm sure we can all code right if you

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,060
want to see more of my visuals I've been

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,100
doing code member this month so if you

00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,630
go on code pen and look me up and see a

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,620
whole bunch of experiments I've been

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,790
doing I've been trying to do them in

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,430
different ways as well whether that's

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,440
normal Dom elements like looping over

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,540
sort of il

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,670
and changing sizes which is the spectrum

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,680
you saw earlier or trying new things out

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,960
like using d3.js that's a really really

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,430
nice library to use for taking the data

00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:55,080
and manipulating it and doing things

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:58,020
with it but how do we control it web

00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,790
MIDI API right so when my favorite

00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,530
things to talk about you say midi to

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,840
somebody and everybody just assumes it's

00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,820
bleep e electronic music i am going to

00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,300
i'm going to break your brains it is not

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,860
even sound midi is a data protocol it

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,600
came about in the 80s and a bunch of

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,220
industry experts and music manufactures

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,720
got together and they said we've got all

00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,860
these amazing electronic instruments

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,390
these days and they've got no way to

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,970
talk to each other and they weren't

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:23,220
let's make let's make a protocol so they

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,110
did we are all running midi controllers

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,480
here all three of us only one of them is

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,950
being used to make sounds like he's

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,980
using went to control lights with which

00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,690
is pretty brilliant this this is a

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,810
million a word instrument so this has

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,340
onboard audio right we pretty much steam

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,440
run of these this is a keyboard you play

00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,300
it play sounds it also sends MIDI data

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,500
so you can plug this into your computer

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:48,840
and it will send MIDI data this this is

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,010
a controller this is what we're using so

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,480
it does the same thing it sends midi

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,610
data but it doesn't have any onboard

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,140
audio so you can just plug into a laptop

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,620
you run the web MIDI API you're

00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,720
basically getting numbers so this is my

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,250
midi controller I've got a little one

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,090
they've got big once it's my handbag

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,410
midi controller oh and if we get the

00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,780
camera over here so you can see what

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,240
would undoing can i point it that way

00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,880
what should happen i say this happens is

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,520
when I crossfade using the bottom slider

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,810
here it will fade from one visual into

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,510
the other visual there's a tiny bit of

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,150
latency but yeah we're going from the

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,610
love the opening for JSA de into the

00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,470
speakers and back again and all I'm

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,240
doing is just picking up on the numbers

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,960
and making sure that happens we make it

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,910
go back again there you go thank you so

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,100
MIDI is a great data protocol and it

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:41,280
actually influenced other things like a

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:46,710
lighting protocol which is DMX which I

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:51,880
believe Martin is using I am actually

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:53,890
so just a bit of background information

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,680
if you so there's this protocol called

00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,450
DMX which is basically used by any sort

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,930
of professional lighting equipment but

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:04,420
if you ever have a look at how these

00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:07,960
lights are normally operate their huge

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:11,010
custom-made computers that are terribly

00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:15,010
expensive I couldn't afford one so I

00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:18,040
look like mmm I can build something like

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:21,130
that myself so this is one of the two

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,500
medium two phases notnot media DMX DMX

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:27,010
interface is that I'm using to control

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:31,630
all the lights here in this venue um so

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:36,720
how DMX works as a pretty simple so DMX

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:40,020
has 512 channels hence the name DMX 512

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:44,230
and all each of these channels is

00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:47,050
basically just one byte number and in

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:51,150
DMX there's always only one sender and

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:54,820
all the other devices are receivers

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:57,100
there's something I call device mapping

00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,220
happening which means that every device

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,810
needs to know which of these 512

00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:08,710
channels it should read from a stream of

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:10,810
512 bytes so I define a start address

00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:13,420
for each device which is the first

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,760
address agreed and then the menu says

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,360
for instance or device will read like

00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,790
four channels for different functions or

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,910
maybe just one channel if it's just a

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:27,580
lamp that I can doom or switch on and

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,530
off or something like that but the most

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,480
annoying thing about DMX is how its

00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,060
implemented because every manufacturer

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,880
does completely different things with it

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,220
so that they're sometimes you can

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,830
control the color with 16-bit well I use

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,860
using two channels sometimes just ate

00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:48,030
but were you so it's kind of horrible to

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:52,870
just manipulate the spider race manually

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:55,780
however we look at something like this

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:58,270
this is basically DMX translated to

00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,860
JavaScript so I have a unsigned int

00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:03,870
array

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:05,880
512 bytes and this device data would be

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:09,680
a slice of that array that the device

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,590
sees in this case starting at address 42

00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:16,020
obviously and gather the array index

00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:19,740
zero bias dmx addresses are always one

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,120
based and so for instance some device

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,800
mapping could look like those that I

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,290
have one channel the control to

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:30,840
brightness and three channels and

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:33,450
control a color value but however most

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,010
devices especially adult that way i have

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:39,630
here i'm not that simple so the

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:43,500
spotlights we have here in the venue

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:46,260
have like 20 stepper motors and all

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:49,140
sorts of really complex stuff going on

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,510
so they are moving hat spotlights like

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,310
you see in a picture so you can control

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,100
with pan until you can control the

00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,900
motion then there's the brightness and

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,250
the color value the caliber you is not

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,980
RGB but it is an see my color mixing

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:08,430
then we have configurable lenses so I

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,620
can move both lenses back and forth so I

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,840
can have half parameters like zoom and

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,930
focus and then there are special beam

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,740
shaping effects and a lot of more stuff

00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:23,670
so in total verse 27 channels for each

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:27,210
of these devices in order to manage that

00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:29,220
I wrote this library called 512 and I

00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:32,160
did that for last year's jazz comfy you

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,680
where I was first presented which is

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:39,960
basically just a really neat abstraction

00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:43,620
library for this dmx512 protocol coat

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,350
looks like this so I have DMX device the

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,790
first parameter as an address the second

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,460
parameter is a list of all the

00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,710
parameters that device accepts I left

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:58,200
them out because it's usually really

00:18:52,710 --> 00:19:00,240
really long list and yeah once I have

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,450
those device I can just assign values to

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,090
a property is so which is quite amazing

00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:10,590
what define property year allows me to

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,750
do there there are also things automatic

00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,710
version from degrees to the internal

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,630
system of the Miller moving heads or

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,640
even every CSS Calla values

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:27,659
automatically translated into see my

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:29,940
color format so um I wanted to do some

00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:32,640
light show with it so the simplest way

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,000
would be so I I have some sort of

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,960
integral function and yeah I can I can

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,850
just use something like trigonal

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,770
trigonometric functions I had those were

00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:50,539
just to control the motion and and that

00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:53,130
works give me a smooth motion but

00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:54,990
controlling this was something like

00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:58,190
these mini midi controllers here and

00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:00,570
constantly switching and not knowing how

00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,700
exactly the lights are layout and when

00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,649
you I would have magic numbers

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,860
everywhere so I decided to go a

00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:12,809
different route and Reeve real bad cold

00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:15,720
so it look like this so um you might you

00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:17,850
might notice what I did there I still

00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,120
the same properties but it's just CSS

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:26,279
syntax which is really very much easier

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:31,500
to ride um but yeah how could that even

00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:34,740
work so the first thing i did was i have

00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,500
some HTML so I have something that I can

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,200
style which looks like this so I have

00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,020
devices I have the device route and no

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,899
browser of a dentist it's just chrome

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,149
didn't complain about there being some

00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:50,820
unknown texts I could still style them

00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:53,820
as I liked so I have these channel

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,950
numbers so one coulomb is the business

00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,799
interface number so which of these two

00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:02,070
interfaces will handle this title the

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,320
second one the channel number and then I

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:07,799
have some classes and stuff that i can

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:11,100
use when writing that CSS and then there

00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,649
is a little bit of JavaScript so i can

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,770
just very all these device notes from

00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:19,649
from the document and then I can use get

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,450
computed style doing this repeatedly in

00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:22,210
an animation loop so i can always get

00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,360
the

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:28,780
current value of all my custom

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,150
properties that I just made up and then

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,750
I just need to decode what is in the

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:37,630
style so from string to number

00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:42,970
conversion stuff like that and write it

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:46,360
out using the dmx interfaces but there's

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:50,170
one problem with that because if I just

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,940
write pan colon zero degrees the browser

00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,950
will just say and now that's invalid

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,160
seus as I don't have that in computed

00:21:53,950 --> 00:22:00,490
style so I had to do a little trick

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:03,040
which is using custom properties so

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,840
color is something the browser knows and

00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,550
animation is something the browser knows

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,590
but everything else just gets the plug

00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:12,670
custom property so i can read out the

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:15,930
values but i don't know if you've been

00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:18,700
here yesterday's talk by Leah veeru

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:21,370
custom properties and animations don't

00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,580
mix so there's a proposal for that and I

00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:25,840
would have hoped i have a working

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,480
implementation of that now here but

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:33,610
didn't show up so I needed a hack for

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,560
that this is this one so I figured I can

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:39,040
just use any animatable feels as

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:40,750
property and just instead of writing pan

00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,570
I can right left and instead of right

00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:46,120
until I write lat riot and instead of

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:49,420
brightness I could write top or all

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,550
these margins or all these border radius

00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,800
and any any animatable sees as property

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:56,860
would work for this so i have a huge

00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,960
repository of properties that i could

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,380
animate instead of my own custom

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:06,280
properties so the heck is this I pass

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:09,340
all those years SI right and then modify

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:13,090
the AST so i can add these custom

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:15,940
properties and animation for bags then

00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:18,460
finally reassemble it into a CSS source

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,970
code and inject it into the browser and

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,160
finally in this animation group that are

00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,720
shown that i've shown you get computed

00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:31,660
style will always give me the current

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,770
value of all those animations and to

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,950
prove this

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:39,340
this is um the code that has been

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:44,140
running all the time so we have for

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:48,220
instance as a whole lot of CSS that I

00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:50,770
wrote last day but um so I have these

00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:54,850
abbreviations like you p for the quantum

00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:58,900
profile and AQW for the quantum wash

00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:08,460
light and i can now just go ahead and be

00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:13,470
like nah QW and let's say brightness 1

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,470
this will be full brightness all right

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:24,400
and it gets even brighter now this app

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:32,650
III know I no no no problem is i'm

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:36,720
missing it's been in pin being overrun

00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:40,240
by and here i can also show you that

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,940
this is actually happening right in my

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:47,860
browser so here's this device root and i

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:50,590
can now just look at this here and so

00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:56,220
which one stage floor stage fours

00:24:50,590 --> 00:25:00,070
interesting let's look at this one ah so

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:03,790
come up and here you see all these

00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:06,520
others generators style so i have this

00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:11,260
color white here which is now over

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:14,850
written somewhere here and i believe i

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:19,650
should be able open those aren't on okay

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:25,600
so i can also just go ahead and write

00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:27,490
directly until my dev tools additional

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:34,090
CSS for all these sir for all these

00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:41,130
devices anyway so it's about to reload

00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:46,560
um and now stuck here

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:52,950
okay this bed oh that's great yeah I

00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:55,560
guess wow the little what I what I will

00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:59,340
be presenting with for the for the next

00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:02,250
hours and the final thing what I need to

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:05,340
know tell you is this thing will do

00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:09,420
nothing out and toggling CSS classes on

00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:13,170
that devices element on the top so if i

00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:16,230
just press these buttons you see devices

00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:21,630
updates the style and animations start

00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:24,690
and stop and move and so on right was my

00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:26,550
part roof that's amazing it if you

00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,230

in my hand and you guys have voices and

00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,020
you have feet and you have hands and you

00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,640
can whack all those things together

00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:02,550
we'll see what happens not each other

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:04,820
though okay and just adjust that we will

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:08,010

00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:35,020
warmup what is with it okay okay um can

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,140
I get everyone to on the count of three

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,760
to stomp their foot I know it sounds

00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:45,340
unusual but it makes a very good

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:59,200
standing kick drum hang on okay one two

00:27:45,340 --> 00:28:10,150

beautiful singing voice or just a voice

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,450
is good enough voices so I'm creating a

00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,450
new chunk which I'm going to drop on my

00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:50,590
launch pad as you can see on the screen

00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:53,200
there these here they curl correspond to

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:55,420
my actual hardware so I'm just saying on

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,580
this particular pair XY coordinates i

00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:00,880
want this particular sound and so now

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,650
