Publication date: 2016-12-15
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2016
Description: 
	Node.js is growing up, and with that comes the responsibility of delivering proper legacy support. From Node.js Argon (v4.2.0) onwards, there is an official Long Term Support release cycle that lasts for 30 months. How does a project moving at the pace of Node maintain multiple release lines? How does a commit get backported? How is a release actually made? You will learn all this and more in this talk.

Myles is an artist, musician, developer, and inventor. He works for IBM spending most of his time contributing to the node.js ecosystem. He graduated with a Master of Music Science and Technology from c.c.r.m.a. a.k.a the center for computer research in music and acoustics.
