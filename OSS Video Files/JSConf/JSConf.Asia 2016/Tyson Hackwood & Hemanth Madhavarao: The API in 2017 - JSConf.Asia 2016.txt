Description: 
	Let’s talk developer programs, standards, scale, SDKs, REST, good and bad practices, documentation, business, security, and regulation. Let's talk APIs.

Tyson has been actively involved in both Online Payments and Mobile Payments for 15 Years, with extensive experience working with both traditional and next generation businesses. He has worked with many of these organisations through his time in Braintree, PayPal and Vodafone.
He is excited by projects and businesses that are trying to enhance ‘mobile’ experiences and drive commerce by using the ‘invisible payments’ like Uber, Hotel Quickly, Hailo and many others in the Asia region.
Currently expanding the Asia footprint of Braintree, is involved with expanding access to the traditional payment methods as well as the emerging payment technologies. Is an avid mentor and educationalist, spending much of his time explaining ‘payments’ and how they can be used to grow commerce. Related to this is his love of ‘start-up’ t- shirts and stickers.
