Publication date: 2015-12-20
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2015
Description: 
	This talk on PostCSS, will give you a quick overview of what PostCSS can do for you, how you can leverage PostCSS plugins to take a lot of the developer error out of front-end development.

Originally from a farm in New Zealand, picked up programming while applying for a job in economics and never looked back. Mostly Rubyist, JS and CSS are my second and third loves. I teach people how to code through Rails Girls and Ruby Tea Party as I want to demystify the industry.
