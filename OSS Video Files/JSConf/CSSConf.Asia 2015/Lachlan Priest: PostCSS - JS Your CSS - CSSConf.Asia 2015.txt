Publication date: 2015-12-20
Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2015
Description: 
	This talk on PostCSS, will give you a quick overview of what PostCSS can do for you, how you can leverage PostCSS plugins to take a lot of the developer error out of front-end development.

Originally from a farm in New Zealand, picked up programming while applying for a job in economics and never looked back. Mostly Rubyist, JS and CSS are my second and third loves. I teach people how to code through Rails Girls and Ruby Tea Party as I want to demystify the industry.

hello I'm actually a rubios and this

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,890
quite loud and a JavaScript developer

00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:27,470
portrayed so CSS is kind of like a

00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:30,289
necessity for me and so this talk is had

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,760
a sneak JavaScript into a CSS comp I'm

00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:33,590
going if you're walking tour of how

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,020
folks USS works and I'm going to teach

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,150
you how I can into how integrated it to

00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,790
an e-commerce platform to convert that

00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,290
platform from English to Arabic so I try

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,030
to hold on to things and I was trying to

00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,199
make it fail because I wanted this to be

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,420
a story of agony because they're way

00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:51,170
more fun to watch I find tragedies the

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:55,070
best for this story okay so about me I

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,379
do a mean Ron Swanson impression my name

00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,330
is Lachlan priest I go by at LC priests

00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:01,460
pretty much everywhere there are two

00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,650
Lachlan fries on this planet one's a 16

00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,620
year 16 Australian and he stole my

00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,930
twitter handle he followed Justin Bieber

00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,180
and then stopped using Twitter so I'm

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:16,130
just gonna give it to him and you won

00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:18,110
this one dick yeah so most the time if

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,960
I'm working on Ruby on Rails and images

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,810
so I always here so is Ruby Jade yet is

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,460
in bj's dead yet I'm like not just go

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,990
back to my work now so this is what I

00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,670
work on a specially closed source but I

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,540
try and contribute one thing a week back

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,890
to open source generally in systems or

00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,160
integrations that I'm working with like

00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:43,100
closely not really sure why Thomas let

00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,690
me speak to the CSS comp but let's go so

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,970
I went for trade gecko that's this group

00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:50,420
up front they're my co-workers and I

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:53,570
Boston to laugh for me so just use their

00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,100
cue um so this little guy he's moco I

00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,050
have stickers if you want some stickers

00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,490
he was invented by our design team and

00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,870
he is the embodiment of our company

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:05,090
thats is a James Bond theme I think

00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:08,750
shakin what's dead my official job title

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:14,750
is the most huggable engineer okay so

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:16,879
post ESS uh it is who knows it sounded

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,989
cool and I wanted to remove sass from a

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,260
JavaScript object we're working on

00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:23,329
because we have one main API and I was

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,769
building an e-commerce platform that use

00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:25,160
that API but didn't need to have any

00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,110
back in

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,210
services so I didn't want a lib SAS

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,930
dependency so I just had to use post CSS

00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:35,330
so what is it I'm no idea well I had no

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,440
idea whenever I do a blog or a talk I

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,930
like to pick something I've never

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,670
touched before and learn about it so

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,510
that's what I did how do you learn about

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,940
things go to github great this tells me

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,040
nothing it is a tool for transforming

00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:53,090
styles with jes plugins that means

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,650
nothing to me okay but if you look down

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,630
further it's talking about how post CSS

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,450
passes CSS and lets you do other things

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:02,240
so it does nothing by itself but with

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,060
other things you can do magic okay so

00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,910
when I started this this talk I had a

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,320
hypothesis that I would fail at this and

00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,940
would be a great story of me failing

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,350
something anyway and the point I wanted

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,000
to make was that it's more important to

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,500
do your job than to play with new

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,600
technologies being with ruby on rails in

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,040
in bjs everyone asked me why we haven't

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,470
moved to go or some new fancy language

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,120
that is great we didn't move because

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,660
there's a lot of effort and I want to do

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,300
features so now with Paula CSS I wanted

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,640
to find out what I can use it for okay

00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:38,750
so I'll take an input file this is some

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,570
CSS as you can see and store / CSS and

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,540
run it I had to include this plug-in on

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,550
the far right which I wrote because you

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,650
can't even run / CSS without a plugin it

00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:52,190
does nothing don't worry this is the

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:55,340
output it's exactly the same what does

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,140
Posey assistive it's not a preprocessor

00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,820
the main thing you hear when you talk

00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,890
about posea says is that it's not sass

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,160
it's not less it doesn't do any of those

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:06,350
things but it can it's just a passer and

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,870
it passes your CSS into a series of

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,300
notes so the nodes go like this there's

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,180
a root node that is your entire fifth

00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,640
his file there are rules those are divs

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,609
whatever all the elements classes and

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,060
ID's there are declarations which are

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:24,470
like color and this color is really

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,740
important it is gecko green like the

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,480
t-shirts and just a nice font and then

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,190
there are comments so you can track all

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,850
of those things using Pro CSS and then

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,979
perform operations on those things post

00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,520
CSS provides a nice little API to that

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,879
is provided to all plugin

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,599
we were past an object called container

00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:48,270
and that can that object has a variety

00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:49,830
of functions the functions are walk

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,409
declarations walk rules and what

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,900
comments they're essentially a for each

00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:57,030
I don't know why they call it that for

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,409
those specific things now if we go back

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:04,229
to those things a declaration is a CSS

00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:07,110
property a rule is a different class and

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:09,470
comment is a comment obviously so the

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,610
API comes with little plugins and

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,440
because it's just an API and does

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,750
nothing the community provided

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:21,300
everything else here's a list of some of

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:24,599
the plugins there's like 200 of them so

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,460
I'll go over the first bit again i think

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,889
i just talked about this the main point

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,110
is that it's not a preprocessor it's not

00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,810
really anything but there is a

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,340
preprocessor processor plugin so pre CSS

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,669
provides you everything that SAS

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:42,330
provides you but with just a JavaScript

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:44,490
so in my day job I have this this is an

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,020
e-commerce platform it has like 10

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,930
different pages it's very small very

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,000
easy to use and it's got demo data about

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,139
Willy Wonka I don't know why it's always

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,900
been in our production that's always

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,539
going to stay so I want to replace ass

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,880
with row CSS so i did that i installed

00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,440
post ESS apparently the normal library

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,599
is broken so there's a fixed one and

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,050
then i installed pre CSS which is the

00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:11,909
SAS drop-in replacement nothing changed

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:13,380
again so at this point I kind of had

00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:15,300
like a draft email to Thomas being like

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,610
this isn't working I was trying to be

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,650
funny nothing's breaking it just works I

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,599
had away how do I make this story about

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,900
posties his failing means sticking with

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:28,430
the status quo work so i decided to try

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:31,770
and break it it's pretty hard actually

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,630
so what do I do now let's translate the

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,819
website so anyone that works with me

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,039
knows that my main contributor can check

00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,719
our contribution to github is in all the

00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,210
qas I'll call out all of the files you

00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:44,370
haven't translated and just what i 18 n

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,620
or internationalisation like hundreds of

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:50,070
times everywhere all the time it's the

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,509
most annoying thing but it helps so even

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,009
with my admittedly very aggressive

00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,900
stance

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:56,599
I've never actually translated a project

00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:00,020
I've just made it possible so how was /

00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:02,629
CSS useful here it's not really so and

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:07,159
here comes ma this is my he's my co

00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:09,439
worker that works on slack by the way

00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:13,610
you can use gifts and it's amazing what

00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:15,499
happens okay so mo and I we run a meetup

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,119
called Ruby tea party where we teach you

00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:19,610
what Ruby because there aren't enough in

00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:21,080
the community and I love Ruby this is

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,599
really important to me because I taught

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,009
myself the code and the community really

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,740
helped me with that so I wanted to give

00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:29,979
back so Mohamed and I always talk about

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,479
startups on what we could do and how

00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:34,639
sorry Mohammed's from Syria speaks

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,349
Arabic and we're discussing how no one

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,149
really caters towards the Arabic market

00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:40,339
so wouldn't it be cool if we could build

00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:41,719
a project that works for them so first

00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,339
of all I wanted to try it in our own

00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:45,139
projects because I don't really have any

00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:48,999
side projects worth marketing right now

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:51,289
or ever i don't know i'm not very busy

00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:52,909
so if you want to come to the tea party

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:54,469
by the way it's every thursday come talk

00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:59,089
to me we have great offices in this free

00:07:54,469 --> 00:08:00,229
food so the way we can work with arabic

00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,270
is that there are two things yet to do

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,800
one is translate the project and the

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,349
second has changed at X direction and

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,779
even the flow of the app so there is a

00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:11,180
plugin for Posey SS surprise that does

00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,789
this this is an example of github if you

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,409
reverse it they've still got an English

00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:17,559
I don't know why but this is the point

00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:19,789
this is mohammed a different mohammed

00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:22,249
that I reached out to an almost offered

00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:25,879
a job too but he was in Jordan and

00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:29,300
didn't leave any you need to make sure

00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,610
that your site not just is in Arabic but

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,500
feels native to an Arabic speaker so the

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,680
way this plugin works is that it takes

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,360
your CSS this is the top and the bottom

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,550
and all it really does is it finds all

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,490
lefts and rights and equivalent things

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,829
and switches them so if you run the plug

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,360
in your position relative left hand

00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:49,010
picks becomes right Tim picks and it

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,290
just works because every time you

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,690
reference aside like float left position

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,670
left texture issue a direction left to

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,170
right all year to do is reverse it and

00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,550
then suddenly it works because the

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,130
browser was just this way there's no up

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,959
and down there's no rotation great

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,259
obviously before you can translate so

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,600
I'm going to slow down going for

00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,699
just obviously before you can translate

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,589
is a bunch of manual work like putting

00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:12,629
all your strings in your app into one

00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:14,669
file so this is all of the texts i think

00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:16,619
it's another like 500 lines in that

00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:19,739
e-commerce store it's only like nine

00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:21,299
hundred words and i had to get it

00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:23,160
translated obviously i could have asked

00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,289
mohammed but he's got stuff to do so i

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,850
found a service the same way that i

00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:28,019
always find something new if I want to

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,089
learn a new technology you'll see how

00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:34,470
best practices it is I go check out

00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:36,479
discourse discourse is a images and

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,979
rails app it's much bigger than ours in

00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:40,379
its open source so it's always a good

00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:42,029
spot to work on like scaling problems or

00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,579
learn new things so the way they

00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:46,470
translate it I think it's in like 60

00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:48,239
languages now the way they translated it

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,949
is with this project called transifex

00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:51,479
you just throw your strings in there and

00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:53,429
you can translate it as a group or you

00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:55,169
can pay someone I obviously didn't have

00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:57,629
a group so I found someone to pay and it

00:09:55,169 --> 00:10:00,269
was like 130 dollars the translate to

00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:02,789
Arabic incredibly cheap didn't wanna pay

00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:04,139
myself so I convinced my boss but so

00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:05,759
here are the numbers to commit your bust

00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,949
by the way there are 19 countries that

00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,709
speak Arabic natively 280 million eight

00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:12,239
is needed Arabic speakers five percent

00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,519
of our customers are from arabic arabic

00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:16,739
countries and for naps in the world

00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,529
speaks over in Italy natively so why are

00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:21,329
these customers using our product at

00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,639
that ratio which is higher than the

00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,379
standard if there is something available

00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,359
for the Arab market turns out there

00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,339
isn't if you look so my company does

00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:30,509
inventory management software if you

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,919
look up English inventory management

00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:34,649
software you get seven million results

00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:37,529
in English half million in Arabic and if

00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:41,639
you actually use average tank text you

00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:44,730
get even less so 123 dollars and 36

00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:50,459
hours later my site was in Arabic super

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:52,769
easy there we go whoops 12 mini now it's

00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,659
an Arabic obviously I didn't translate

00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:56,939
the dynamic data I probably could have

00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:59,279
given you example data for that but all

00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:01,049
of the layout is and it looks pretty

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,729
nice actually so this is where

00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:07,859
right-to-left CSS comes in I had to

00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:09,149
reverse the UI direction in order to you

00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:11,519
know make it more comfortable for Arabic

00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,980
speakers so rad clear CSS comes along

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,990
runs it over my files and it's not

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,060
perfect

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,670
in fact it breaks quite a lot in random

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,250
places but that's actually a case of

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,710
first of type last child etc when you're

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,630
trying to do border radiuses and a few

00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,550
other things and it just doesn't work

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,400
perfectly but a little bit of hand with

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:35,950
your magic layer and it looks great so

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,850
everything is aligned I may have just

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:44,200
used developer tools for this but so

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:46,450
telia / CSS does nothing but it provides

00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,830
an API for us to do everything like if

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,940
we go back to those previous slides I'm

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,000
not going to jump in so it's like 30

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,040
back there are approximately 200

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,170
different plugins available ones that do

00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,170
like color blindness to usability

00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:04,870
obviously i think is a translation one

00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:06,190
minification CSS next is this for BAM

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,220
linting that's really important five

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,290
teams are trying to move to bem just a

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,330
million of them one of them CSS format

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,500
that all is great I ran at once and I

00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,050
think in committed four thousand lines

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,290
of CSS to github because it tied

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:24,970
everything up great so Perseus does

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:28,570
nothing it's just an API but it allows

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,740
for a awesome ecosystem to form and one

00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,090
of the things I love about it is it

00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,460
allows people to stop arguing about

00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,510
Seth's like capabilities because they

00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,260
don't want Ruby could dependencies in

00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,250
the jas projects I love sass it's great

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,490
I want to stick with it as long as

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:45,190
possible but if I can get all of the

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,230
functionality SS without using Ruby or

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,180
lips s or whatever it's great I would

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,440
love to do that because in bridge is

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,890
great and I never want to touch Ruby

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,850
when I'm touching Ember anyway ok so I

00:12:53,890 --> 00:13:01,170
think I've gone a little bit too fast

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:03,430
that was my second to last slides I

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,650
don't know why this video came out but

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:09,250
it came with so many cool gifts this guy

00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,720
is amazing sidenote internationalisation

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,580
gets really addictive here it is in

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,980
Spanish um that took me another 36 hours

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,470
at one hundred twenty dollars as you can

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,660
see it's super easy let's go more into

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,960
my CSS I can do this for hours so the

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,360
community is super weird one of the

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,120
things that I as a new zealand I just

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,430
like about si si

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,320
that's in American English someone fixed

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,790
that you can now write your CSS as if

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,040
you're British what the you with

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,800
transparency with sintel as its to be

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,620
spelled and it just translates just

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,330
compile sorry to the right version our

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,120
very own Sebastian deckers who's

00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:50,470
actually teaching across the road he put

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,910
this one which is amazing so you can use

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:56,210
nonsense units in his fiercest and it

00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:59,779
just works that joke there is 20,000

00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:02,540
Leagues Under the Sea so my contribution

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,550
was a post English post ESS English

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,810
style sheets I had to get a co-worker to

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,540
check this to make sure I wasn't insane

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:10,100
Thank You jing-mei um it was really hard

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:14,150
to find a lot of things I ended up just

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:17,480
doing colors this entire thing was built

00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,890
in like twelve lines of JavaScript so

00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,510
that's just doing the warp declarations

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:24,800
and then you can just go over each them

00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:26,480
and it just gripped um I did the ice

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,300
kacang is my favorite it does the the

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,470
gradient and it's beautiful I don't I

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,650
guess foreigners wouldn't understand

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:36,080
that one but anyway that's great man I'm

00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:39,470
way and time sorry I shoulda spoke and

00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,180
slow okay so you want to learn more

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,959
check out discourse discourse is an

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,779
awesome resource for learning rails

00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:50,060
umber scaling just anything transifex

00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:53,390
was the translation software that took

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,180
me maybe 20 minutes to master the U is

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,760
not amazing but they're getting there

00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:00,410
obviously pro CSS is available and if

00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,930
you didn't actually listen to me there's

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:07,690
another video of a guy who wrote OH CSS

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:11,270
Heaney's available to this is pushing

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:13,760
he's a ginger with a mustache like me um

00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:17,150
I couldn't find a top hat in the monocle

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,790
but I tried pretty hard sorry I went

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,800
away under time doing any questions

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,770
excuse gone when you were playing around

00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,900
with post CSS apart from dodgy

00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,330
translations and things like that did

00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,700
you find any plugins they're quite

00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,740
useful or do you not really use it at

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,230
the moment I actually I dropped it into

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,120
I'm a nap and replace s like it was I

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,829
did everything I needed to do I was just

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,240
surprised it work so easily like I

00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:42,500
wanted to be like its Tara

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,140
don't use it but it just worked

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,550
perfectly so at the moment I'm using CSS

00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,339
and nano which is a mentor fire i'm

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,690
using scissors next so i can try and

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,899
drop variables and use the standard one

00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,370
that's coming out with CSS for either of

00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,589
them I don't think this is this for

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,160
think it's called CSS next and we're

00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:03,020
also using pre CSS to replace s

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,790
obviously and i'm probably going to put

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,560
in beam lint in the future because

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:12,350
brooke my main front end co-worker is

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,870
trying to get us a switch it works

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,130
really well i also i wanted to do one

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,350
for color blindness because our company

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,959
uses way too many like greys and I want

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:25,040
to like demonstrate that to out like

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:27,770
exec team yeah I was just wondering like

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,100
you were saying pre CSS what's very well

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:33,260
if you convert from SAS to Paul CSS I

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:37,100
was just wondering if you use like

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:43,580
multiple libraries or obsess mix-ins was

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:46,310
it like things up so pre CSS is a

00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,800
set of smaller / CSS libraries that give

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,120
you all of those functionalities are

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:55,490
posted says at rules which is the main

00:16:50,120 --> 00:17:00,350
sets mix in tool and then post ESS
