Playlist: CSSConf.Asia 2015
Description: 
	What do you do when the project of redesigning emails AND making them responsive becomes yours? You've heard the rumors: designing emails means coding like it’s the year 2000, creating tables and adding styles inline, and throwing best practices and hopes of compatibility out the window. BREATHE. In this session, get your emails in shape for 2016 and ready for the responsive spotlight! We’ll see: 

- Why you need a reusable, maintainable template and how to design one.
- When and how to use media queries and the ever controversial !important.
- What vendors and properties require CSS prefixes
- How to make desktop, mobile, and web-based clients play nicely with your code, and which ones to watch out for.

Jennifer is a self taught web developer. She spends her days on the front end, making the web a prettier and more functional place. In a former life, she was a civil engineer and is still a registered Engineer in Training (No. EIT 121059) with the California Department of Consumer Affairs. She's a jane of all trades and loves eating, coding, and sleeping.

you

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,800
alright so as waging said I'm Jennifer

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,750
Wong and I'm here to talk about

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,169
designing responsive emails and coding

00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:30,310
in the year 2000 and you all are welcome

00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:37,870
to follow along by going to this github

00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:40,680
link here and to start so Who am I I am

00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,390
a software engineer at eventbrite and

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,760
before that I actually worked as a civil

00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,879
engineer just like these two ladies here

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,039
I quickly became bored with the very

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,020
slow pace of the projects at that time

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,020
you know things when you're making

00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,190
buildings it takes years to complete so

00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,320
I wanted to be in a more innovative

00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,800
space and I decided that that would be

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,700
tech so to get my foot in the door I

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,520
started doing I started working as a

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,560
community specialist for a startup and

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,869
that meant that I was actually just

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,440
doing customer support for a company

00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:19,119
that was around for about 10 years I

00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,270
totally totally hated it and so I

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,060
decided to teach myself to code I would

00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,729
work on my projects at nights I would go

00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,830
to hack my hackathons and I just kept

00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:33,160
working on these things and eventually

00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:35,739
that led to success and I landed my

00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:42,610
first job as a front-end developer at a

00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:45,160
company called hot pads yay so here we

00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:48,250
go my first assignment at hot pads was

00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,020
to redesign all of our emails and make

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,739
them responsive and I was like oh yeah

00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,629
no problem super easy right I started

00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:58,300
working them on those emails and I

00:01:55,629 --> 00:02:02,410
thought oh crap I have no idea what I'm

00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:04,810
doing but fortunately i'm here to share

00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:08,890
all of my strategies and mistakes with

00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:11,260
you all so my story is about how emails

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,580
are evil which I'm sure many of you can

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,709
relate to if you've ever worked on

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,300
responsive emails so I'll talk a bit

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,070
about design

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,870
food and I'll share some resources that

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:25,840
i found along the way so to start I'm

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,520
going to talk about design so first

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,800
things first when I was working on

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,180
hotpads they asked me to redesign their

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,770
welcome email and i decided to first

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,750
start by doing a bunch of research so i

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,460
signed up for a ton of different

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,360
services just so i could look at their

00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:45,250
welcome emails I thought the prettiest

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,080
email that i found was actually in d

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:56,680
gogos which we can take a look at here

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:58,300
very quickly oh there we go so the first

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,280
thing I notice about this email is they

00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,170
have this top anchored logo so you know

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,810
exactly where the emails coming from and

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,790
as they move down the page I see a lot

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,100
of really beautiful image content and

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,470
notice that all their calls to action

00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,590
are the same color so I can just click

00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:16,330
on these buttons on these pink links and

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:21,340
also i can click on the images which is

00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:22,870
great so keep scrolling down and then I

00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,120
also notice that there they have these

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,830
social media buttons but also they have

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,290
links in text and that's really great

00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,900
for accessibility and then I also see of

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:37,510
course a way to unsubscribe and update

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:39,250
your subscription so some of the

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,380
takeaways that I found in doing all the

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,900
research and again I received many many

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,180
welcome emails was that most of them

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,540
were very text light many of them were

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,720
very image heavy there was always a logo

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,160
there at the very top of the email and

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,840
also max-width so you didn't have your

00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:01,180
users reading across the page a quick

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,040
disclaimer about all those things so

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,360
they may not work for everybody and I

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,370
highly recommend if you're working on

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,989
emails is to a/b tests all of your

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:13,269
emails so after doing that research I

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:17,079
decided to check out what our welcome

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:19,419
email looked like get ready

00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,159
this is what it looked like the first

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:23,259
thing I notice I'm like why is our logo

00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:26,699
kind of right in the middle of our email

00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:30,699
what's with all that weird spacing and

00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:32,439
why is there text after our closing for

00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,150
like welcome on board but then we add on

00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:38,169
a bunch of stuff at the end and then

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:40,150
there's also no way to unsubscribe so

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:45,729
seeing that email I felt very much like

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:48,310
Doge was like wow just wow all right so

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,469
next up I decided to plan and I was like

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,009
what am I making what am i doing for hot

00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:55,719
pads so I had a couple of goals and

00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:58,419
those two things were to bring

00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:59,830
consistency to our emails our emails

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,650
were just all over the place they all

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,569
look different they all looked crazy so

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,300
I wanted to really give them a more

00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:08,650
formalized template and I thought that

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,509
that would bring a lot of brand

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,940
awareness because once you see that

00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:17,529
recognizable template you know where

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:20,740
your emails are coming from so to make

00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:22,840
or not to make I decided or I checked

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,639
out the internet and saw that there are

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,889
a ton of pre-made email templates that

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,840
you can use so you don't actually have

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,539
to build them from scratch and they can

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,250
be quite helpful but I actually didn't

00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:36,279
use them personally and there are a few

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,830
reasons for that those reasons being

00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,360
that it was my first project as a

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,000
front-end developer and I really wanted

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,310
to get you know in the nitty-gritty of

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,129
the code and so I actually built up our

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,569
template from scratch if you guys have

00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:51,490
less time to work on your emails

00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:56,529
pre-made templates can be a really great

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:58,659
way to go on when designing emails it

00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:00,250
can be really great to sketch so here

00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:02,379
you can see I've sketched the same email

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,940
four different times and that just gives

00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:05,469
you a sense of where you want to lay

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,870
things out and that can really help

00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:11,319
before your coding especially if you

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,719
don't have a designer Photoshop can be

00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,770
really great if you have the skills I

00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:16,770
definitely say go for it

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,419
another thing I wanted to think about

00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:24,460
when I was planning was what I call our

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:27,729
role of thumbs or the minimum touchable

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:32,500
area on mobile devices so I had often

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:34,629
heard of the number 44 x 44 pixels it

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,539
turns out that number is wrong it comes

00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:40,240
from the original iphone human interface

00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:41,530
guidelines for the very first iphone and

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,389
those guidelines don't even exist

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:48,009
anymore so just so you know actually all

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,780
mobile devices have a different minimum

00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,120
touchable area so i've linked to these

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,060
two pages here and they definitely help

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,490
you figure out what that size is and

00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:02,860
it's really dependent on what devices

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:04,690
are most popular with your users so here

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,639
is the new template for our welcome

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:13,330
email that I created I like to say it's

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:17,710
a design for the new millennium in the

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:19,449
year 2000 so the design I can see is

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,830
like a little bit outdated but this is

00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,680
actually what our website looks like

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:27,060
back then and so I was obviously pulling

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,770
some design cues from our website and

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:35,009
just for comparison this is what our old

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:35,009
emails look like and versus the new one

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,810
all right on to some code so here's a

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,710
bunch of tips and tricks that I learned

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:46,449
along the way so some things that I

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:52,770
learned before I started coding our

00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:52,770
emails number one tables are coming

00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,520
mozilla developers network says note

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,469
prior to the creation of CSS HTML table

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,650
elements were often used as a message

00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:08,560
for page layout this usage has been

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,810
discouraged since HTML 4 and the table

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:16,139
element should not be used for layout

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:16,139
purposes email say Lowell

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,980
tables are really important in emails if

00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,930
you don't have a rapper table in your

00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,170
email it actually makes all of your code

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:32,030
disappear in Apple Mail and outlook 2011

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,030
so make sure you have that outer table

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,950
something I also found out was that

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:40,890
tables don't display as inline or block

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,960
or inline block and I was like what what

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:46,230
does that mean well table is actually

00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,360
default to display as table but in that

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,520
case chrome actually will ignore a max

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,080
wits that you said on your emails so you

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:57,810
definitely want to set your table to

00:08:52,080 --> 00:09:01,230
display as block next up is inline

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:03,270
styles you definitely need them reason

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,850
being gmail doesn't support of style on

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:08,130
the head outlook.com doesn't support a

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,650
link element in the head and many

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:14,070
clients don't support a whole like bevy

00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:16,760
and slew of CSS so a really great page

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,700
to help you know what is supported is

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,460
campaign monitor CSS page here what you

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,380
see here is a really great chart which

00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,080
shows all of these different email

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,530
clients and what's supported what CSS is

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,730
supported in them so unfortunately

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,490
you're going to be doing a whole lot of

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,850
this if you're designing emails it's

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:43,830
really ugly I know but it's got to

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:46,560
happen all right again back to max width

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,720
so I think that this company didn't get

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,730
the memo on max width and you see that

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,260
their text just kind of goes all the way

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,650
across the screen and it just makes it

00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,410
really hard to read so it's important to

00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:01,020
set a max width on your email and

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:04,010
typically it's between 550 to 600 pixels

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:08,010
and that's based on most email clients

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:10,140
preview pains a quick note about

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,610
comments when you're writing emails

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,550
you're going to have tables within

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,690
tables within tables and so you're going

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,670
to have tables all the way down your

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,040
page and it's really important to have

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,690
comments so you know where you are so if

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,610
you go back and look at this code really

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,620
quickly you'll see that it's great and

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,480
super helpful to have comments letting

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,480
you know where each table begins and

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,790
all right image alternatives it's always

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,089
great to have an alt tag or a background

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:42,700
color on your images a lot of browsers

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:44,769
and clients don't automatically display

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,690
images and so when that happens it's

00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,640
good to have a back up there and this is

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,940
also great for accessibility so you

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,260
should be doing it on the web as well so

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,089
this is an example of an email in Gmail

00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,890
our logo didn't show up and so it's

00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,769
great to have that alts there so that

00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:06,279
your users know what image is being

00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:07,930
loaded another thing I did is in our

00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,540
footer we had that really beautiful like

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,430
image at the very bottom but I set a

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,500
background color on that so that the

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:19,600
border goes all the way around in case

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:21,779
that images and showing and I created a

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,640
template you can check it out on github

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:26,620
why should you template well it's really

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,810
great to not have to repeat yourself so

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,709
here you see two different emails but

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:35,170
all those little micro listings you'll

00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:37,240
see they overlap between both and so

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,100
those are just kind of little pieces of

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,170
abstracted code that I don't have to

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,820
keep riding over and over again so it's

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:47,260
really helpful to have a template all

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,339
right some things I learned while I was

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,720
coding my emails media queries I'm sure

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:55,120
you guys are all really familiar with

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,610
those they can be super helpful for

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,670
readability and also targeting specific

00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,290
devices a quick note is that there are a

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,209
lot of clients that don't support media

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,130
queries so you'll definitely want to pay

00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:10,120
attention to those and style campaign

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:13,329
did a really great or did some really

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,149
great research on this and so they tell

00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:17,860
you which devices and which email

00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:22,120
clients will support media queries or

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,949
not and with media queries you

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,089
definitely want to cover your bases so

00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:27,579
it's really good to use them in

00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:30,839
conjunction with fluid layouts so here

00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:33,760
I've paired a media query targeting

00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,910
devices that are smaller with the

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,500
percentage based width here and that

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:44,320
will help you cover all the clients that

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:46,870
do and don't support media queries next

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,089
up is device pixel ratio so the device

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,029
pixel ratio is the ratio between logical

00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:53,920
pixels and physical pixels and that will

00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:57,670
help you target retina or high res

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,260
devices and I'll actually come to a

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:03,100
really great example of that in just a

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:06,970
bit all right important when should you

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:11,860
use it a lot of people say never but in

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:13,930
emails it can be necessary sometimes in

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,240
emails your inline styles will overwrite

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,160
media queries so here's a really good

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,550
example of when you actually want to use

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,470
important so in line I have the height

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,990
and the line height of an element set to

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,850
10 pixels but on actually smaller

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,829
devices what I want is to have a height

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,810
and the line height be 5 pixels and so I

00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:38,140
have to set an important on there when

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:39,940
being used with a media query all right

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,550
something weird I learned along the way

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,199
to is about line height if you look at

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,870
the very bottom of this image you'll see

00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:49,899
this like thin blue line right at the

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:52,420
bottom and I'm like what is that oh why

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,459
is that there it's so annoying it turns

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,620
out that the solution to this is to set

00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,810
a line height on the surrounding column

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:04,240
element of your image and that just

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:06,160
brings it down all right some things I

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:12,399
learned after the release of my emails

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:15,390
oops this one is really weird when you

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,520
have an image tag in an anchor tag

00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:20,649
something strange happens sometimes in a

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,480
client you'll see that there's this

00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:24,699
weird gray border around your image and

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,230
it's so it happens so occasionally and

00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:30,550
so strangely that I don't even have an

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:32,260
example of it unfortunately it turns out

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,779
the reason for this is actually the

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,360
white space in your HTML and so you can

00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,339
actually just move the image tag to be

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,470
in the same line as your anchor tag or

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:45,779
you can comment out the white space and

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,779
that removed that weird gray border

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,820
hi-res images for retina

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,740
so this email actually went out to a

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:57,910
bunch of our users and they're like what

00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:01,630
oh my god caution has like oh crap I'm

00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:04,030
sorry so what was the problem here the

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,970
problem was I was using a very large

00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:11,950
image and then sizing it down for retina

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:14,110
devices but outlook 2007 2010-2013 and

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:18,490
outlook and Internet Explorer don't

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:20,740
allow for HTML or css image resizing the

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,200
solution is to set a background image

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,720
your retina image on the surrounding

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,020
column element and then set the inner

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,810
image to display as none and i found

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,460
that solution on campaign monitor so

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:37,420
here you'll see that's exactly what i've

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:41,260
done so i set a background image on our

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:43,090
column element and then the image inside

00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,970
the column element i set to display as

00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:49,600
none so that's how you can use retina

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:54,340
images in your emails um another thing

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:58,180
is that outlook 2007 2010 and 2013 don't

00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:01,330
support max width so what you'll want to

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,820
do here is use a max with bypass what

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:06,190
you do is you set a fluid layout as your

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,100
baseline so you set that to be your

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,690
woods one hundred percent so that all

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,510
use cases use that one hundred percent

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,270
but for larger screens then you'll set

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:20,610
the width to be affixed with instead of

00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:27,040
using max width so you may be wondering

00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:29,920
outlook 2007 2010 in 2013 WTF well the

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,820
reason for their issues is the rendering

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,150
engines outlook 2002 2003 use Internet

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:40,960
Explorer to render their emails outlook

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:43,240
2007 10 and 13 used Microsoft Word as

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,010
their rendering engines and I'm sure you

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,580
guys can understand what problems that

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:50,620
would cause outlook 2011 also called

00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,720
outlook for mac actually uses webkit to

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,850
render their emails and I was like why

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,720
did you guys switch back to Microsoft

00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:01,380
Word in 2013 I don't know but that's

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,380
something to keep in mind

00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,760
again gmail doesn't support styles in

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:09,920
the head so if you want to change the

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,620
color of your links you actually have to

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,260
go and style every single anchor tag in

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,089
line of your email so definitely think

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:23,959
twice before you decide to change that

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:26,300
color AOL and outlook.com they do these

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,150
this really weird thing well the they'll

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:32,060
prefix all of your styles and your

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:36,320
classes with either external class or

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:38,060
ale AOL replaced body a solution to that

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,590
for at least outlook calm is you can

00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,210
actually prefix all your classes

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,850
yourself which is great you can just

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,470
target them right away but AOL you can't

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:50,210
do that because it'll double up the

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:51,590
class and that'll target nothing so I

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,010
found out that actually a well does

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:57,500
support Unicode classes though but not

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:00,800
Unicode IDs and so that's a really great

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,060
way to target AOL styles and that's

00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:07,370
something that I learned from mr. mark

00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:10,670
Robbins unfortunately android mail and

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:14,420
outlook.com in internet explorer also

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:17,890
support the Unicode class but not the

00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:20,750
Unicode ID so targeting AOL it

00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,670
specifically is probably not possible at

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,620
least in what I found but if anybody

00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:30,950
else knows of anything definitely let me

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:32,810
know Yahoo argh they really like to

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,880
strip out a bunch of things so they'll

00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,650
strip out your overflow X property

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,740
they'll strip out any importance that

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:43,370
you have and strangely they'll strip out

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:49,820
a display none in line but not in your

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:53,330
style block something to keep in mind at

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:56,240
WebKit WebKit and opera do not mask on

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:59,330
your border radius so you see here in

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,370
this image on the left you can see that

00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:04,330
that little border radius in grey

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,770
there's a little its kind of blocked

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,600
there's like a little corner missing

00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,880
there I can't see my borderie yes and

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,380
then what I wanted it to show up like is

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,630
on

00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:18,940
right I wanted to see that border-radius

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:20,440
there so what you can do to solve that

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,950
issue if you guys are received at your

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:27,700
border radius is missing is that you can

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,890
add an intermediate div that doesn't

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:33,100
have the CSS positioning on your board

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:35,860
or a radius Oh or the overflow hidden so

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,200
that's this is what that looks like so

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,660
the parent element is positioned the

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,310
intermediate element has the border

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,470
radius and the overflow hidden and

00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,360
that's the one that's not positioned and

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:53,140
that's what will allow your border

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:57,430
radius to appear alright shhh ain't

00:19:53,140 --> 00:20:01,570
changes so android gmail allows you to

00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:03,490
use forms prior to version 5.0 but

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:07,240
android gmail disabled that after

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:10,630
android or after version 5.0 however

00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,700
android email does support forums so

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,070
basically you just have to keep rolling

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,630
with the times we really wanted to use

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,600
forums and you just have to keep doing

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:22,000
research on what you can do to make that

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,520
happen so you have to stay up to date

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,380
and you can stay up to date by checking

00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,830
out a bunch of these resources that I

00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:33,370
found first up there's a bunch of blogs

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:35,920
here style campaign is a great service

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,080
that is run by a woman named Anna Yeaman

00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,360
she's a creative director there and she

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,880
has a bunch of really amazing solutions

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,860
she has this crazy device lab you can

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,960
kind of see it in the background here

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:50,560
and she has tons of devices that she's

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,980
constantly testing on litmus is a really

00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:56,110
great email testing suite and they allow

00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,440
you to test your emails across many

00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:01,240
different clients campaign monitor and

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,490
MailChimp are both online marketing

00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,010
email solutions and they allow you to

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,560
send emails check out analytics and test

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,240
your emails use different templates so

00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,920
these are all really amazing blogs

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,110
they're just working with emails all day

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:20,170
and I found a lot of great information

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:21,520
on those templates so earlier I

00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,850
mentioned that there are a bunch of

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,950
pre-made templates that you can use

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,470
and so here are a bunch of them in the

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,380
background you'll actually see the HTML

00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:34,320
email boilerplate it's a lot of code

00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,450
it's really crazy but of course it's

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,820
going to most likely really hit all

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:43,340
those email clients that you may need to

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:49,440
support so go ahead and check those out

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:53,100
and lastly for resources oops come on

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,630
keyboard testing testing your emails is

00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,730
super important people are reading

00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,890
emails on all types of devices in all

00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,770
types of clients all the time so a bunch

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:04,350
of resources here but litmus email and

00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:07,590
acid and targeted i/o are really great

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:10,620
solutions they they support a ton of

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,809
different clients and puts mail actually

00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,980

00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:18,840
helpful as well and that's all i have

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:26,570
for you if you have questions feel free

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:31,260
to find me after the talk there are some

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:34,980
pseudo cast in CSS by however oh haha

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,720
are they working on the those kinds so

00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,630
you can actually check out that campaign

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,370
monitor CSS page and it'll tell you

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,350
there are some pseudo classes that are

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:48,030
supported and some that are not and it

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:51,870
really depends on the client how do you

00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:54,090
deal with the consistency of once on of

00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:58,049
course i'll email clients that are

00:22:54,090 --> 00:23:00,990
concerned i do america I it email HTML

00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:06,210
email as well and my main problem is the

00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:08,970
font I think custom fonts are not

00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,730
supported on me aside how do you make

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:16,289
the funds consistent on all the

00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:17,789
immigrants use a standard font I think

00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:20,700
that's probably your best solution

00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:23,309
unfortunately is to really have just the

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,140
standard fonts or if you want to use a

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:26,909
custom font to use it just on the

00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,750
clients that support it and definitely

00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:31,650
have like a very

00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:34,240
you know sturdy fall back in that case

00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:37,060
if there any way to bypass the image

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,130
display permissions in outlook like when

00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,950
you first open the mail and outlook you

00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,300
have to like click right click and give

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,280
the permission or display is there any

00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,620
way to bypass that I don't think there's

00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,240
a way to do that unfortunately it has to

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,240
