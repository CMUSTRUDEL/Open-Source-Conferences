	Tips for Tech Challenges and Interviews

Emily Green (https://stories.pusher.com/@emilymaygreen) - Software Engineer @ Pusher (https://twitter.com/pusher)

Take-home coding tasks, whiteboard challenges, and technical interviews are all an inevitable part of getting hired as a developer. I've worked as a developer for 15 years, and have done quite a lot of these things from both sides of the table. Using this experience I've collected together a bunch of practical tips and ideas for how to best tackle these technical challenges, and how to cope when things don't go so well.

About Emily:

I'm Emily Green and I'm a developer at Pusher. In the past I've spoken about functionality programming (mostly Haskell), data and distributed databases, taught a one-day course called "7 languages in 7 hours" for General Assembly, dressed as an Ancient Greek to talk about Paxos to Papers We Love, and led a workshop at SPA conference where people built their own distributed databases. I co-founded the Fun(ctional) Club in Berlin, and co-organised GeekGirlMeetup in London and Berlin

so I'm Emily and I work here as a

00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:10,019
developer sadly and mostly due back-end

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,179
stuff so that's why I'm not doing a

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:16,320
react jeaious talk I'm doing this but

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:19,710
hopefully it'll be useful for you yes so

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,800
Luke's kindly done this bit for me so I

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,529
won't do this bit that's good but if you

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,859
want to tweet us about this talk that's

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:36,360
the handle there so tech challenges and

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,879
tests so when you apply for jobs the

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,379
people potentially hiring you are very

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,420
scared that you're useless

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,530
they're scared that you can't code but

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,730
despite your CV and your experience

00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,399
you're going to get the job and you're

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:55,110
going to do a terrible job so what they

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:59,609
do is they do loads of tech challenges

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,920
and tech tests to test you out and the

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,769
idea is they're trying to weed out

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,400
useless people and get people who are

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:11,670
good and that little pig is called

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,630
petunia pancake and she's competing in a

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,119
State Fair somewhere in America so what

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,000
I mean by technical tests I mean things

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,790
like take home coding challenges where

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,860
you get given a code challenge and told

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,390
oh you've got a week to do it and then

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,220
you have to hand it in so how many

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,180
people have done something like that

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:36,329
here yeah okay it's you know the kind of

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,210
thing I mean technical quizzes so by

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,430
that I mean sort of the short questions

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,079
or short answers so you get asked things

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,229
like unfortunately I'm not going to be

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,180
able to do with JavaScript example but

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,000
say if it was Java it would be what's

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,220
the difference between final finally and

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,090
finalized and then you give this

00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:00,329
standard answer and then whiteboard

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:05,040
challenges everyone's favorite this is

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:07,649
where you get given a more open-ended

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,720
question and you have to do some coding

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,970
or diagrams something like that on the

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,530
white board with your interviewer or

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,990
interviewers interacting with

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,110
whilst you're doing it and how many

00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,590
people have done them before yeah but

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,170
they're pretty scary right yeah yeah and

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,250
then pair programming challenges which I

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,710
would say is similar to whiteboard

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,440
challenges only you have to do it up

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,030
your computer and type and maybe you've

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,050
got a piece of paper there where you can

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,410
draw diagrams

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,270
it depends although you get remote pair

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,320
programming challenges as well which

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,120
sounds extra scary though and that was

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,830
meant to be on the next line but you

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,430
also have technical interviews where

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,440
they're gauging what you know but

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,780
through a conversational style so rather

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,950
than say so maybe they talk to you and

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,620
they want to know if you know about

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,690
Technology X they would say oh I see

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,600
you've had experience in technology yets

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,730
can you tell us how you used it what do

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,560
you think was good about this if you had

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,620
to revisit your decision would you use a

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,350
competitor that kind of thing so they're

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,950
trying to get your technical knowledge

00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,200
out but in the in the course of the

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,440
conversation which hopefully it flows a

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,860
little bit more naturally and of course

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,110
there's loads of others because you know

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,700
people are very inventive and there's so

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,730
many of different ways of trying to do

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,950
this but what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,049
going to go through from the beginning

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,140
and give sort of tips on each of them

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,600
specifically and I probably won't get to

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,480
the end because this talk was really

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,790
designed to be 55 minutes long so when I

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,170
get to light - I need five minutes which

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,910
i think is the amount of time I'll just

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:57,980
stop very much so so let's see if I

00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:00,630
started at 40 okay that's right

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:05,480
so thirsteee though a few general tips

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:08,180
and these tips are about the emotions of

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:13,049
doing technical tests and challenges

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:16,320
because this is the bit which can really

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,540
scupper you because technical challenges

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,800
and tests they can be really scary and

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,410
the scary thing about them I think is

00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,910
that someone's put it there as a way of

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,599
designing whether you'd be good at that

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,469
job

00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:33,330
and which implies that if he fails the

00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:37,889
test you wouldn't be good at that job

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:40,259
and if you at all have any doubts about

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,909
your ability or if you're sort of less

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,949
experienced and you haven't had that

00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:45,810
experience to build up to prove to

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,120
yourself that you're good at your job it

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,050
can be really upsetting and scary that's

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:57,120
of feeling of failure and being judged

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:58,889
but hey I would like to tell you a light

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,310
to get across there

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:04,500
if you fail one of these technical tests

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,629
it's completely normal and everyone does

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,300
it even the most experienced brilliant

00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:11,550
engineers if you ask them they all have

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,400
loads of failed technical tests in their

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:17,400
history I mean first of all these things

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,639
are often incredibly only tangentially

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,659
related to your actual job you'd be

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,639
doing and that's just because companies

00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,339
have no other way of testing really they

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,719
can't

00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:32,490
ideally they get you in for a month and

00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:35,189
try all you out that wouldn't be

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,520
practical so it's normally got nothing

00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:43,969
to do with your actual job also it's

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:49,370
designed to weed out people but it's

00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:52,409
optimized for getting to reducing false

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,479
negatives rather than false positives so

00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:56,550
say if you're brilliant at your job and

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,649
they rejected you they won't find out

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,349
about it and they won't care they'll

00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:03,330
just go oh well that's all right but if

00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,789
you're really bad at your job and they

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:10,529
hire you well that is the disaster for

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:11,969
them so so sort of the fact that you

00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:13,379
might be really good at this job and

00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:15,899
they didn't hire you well that's just

00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:20,759
collateral damage really it's just a

00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:22,460
thing so so if you look at it like that

00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,219
you can see that it's completely normal

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:29,520
to fail these technical tests so when

00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:32,099
you're doing them don't worry about very

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:37,860
little and that'll hopefully make it a

00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:40,570
lot easier instead try and go in with a

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:50,300
more positive learning

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:52,190
mindset I like cute babies so so okay so

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,850
you might not know the answers to a

00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:58,370
question could you ask your interviewer

00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,320
about what the answer could be and get

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,910
the information so that you can use it

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,740
for your next interview or maybe you're

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,900
going to have an awful interview or

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,220
awful tech test but throughout the

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,870
course of it you're going to learn that

00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,850
you would be working with a bunch of

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,380
jerks well that's really good

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,780
information to have learned and you've

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:22,690
dodged a bullet don't work for them go

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:26,270
and work for nice people instead or

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:28,030
there I've got a story of a guy I used

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,560
to work with and we both did the same

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:35,330
Tech interview which was kind of a

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:38,120
whiteboard type thing and he said that

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,220
he was doing terribly at it he didn't

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,080
know any of the questions didn't know

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,580
how to answer it before you know what

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,470
these people seemed quite clever and

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,480
nice I'm going to ask them as many

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:51,140
questions and write it all down for my

00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:53,300
next interview and they ended up hiring

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,800
him on the basis that even if he didn't

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,169
know it now if we could soon know it

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,270
like soon know it because he was so good

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:02,080
at learning like I don't think that

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:05,419
necessarily would happen very often

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,790
that's an unusual case but having that

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:11,990
learning mindset turns a terrible

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:15,080
situation into a positive so yeah try

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:20,390
and do that instead of being scared so

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:22,630
specific advice taken coding challenges

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:27,590
these are actually my favorite ones

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:30,110
because I think of it like this here's

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,599
your time and that's the output of all

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,800
your work and then eventually and you'll

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,300
have done enough work that your

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,250
challenge is good enough that you could

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,089
submit it and you would probably get

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,589
hired right so your main task to begin

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:47,810
with when you're given a challenge is

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:50,660
just a scheduling task so you look at a

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,100
challenge and you work out how much time

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,240
you think it's going to take you and

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,410
then you double it like

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,750
always and then you look at what free

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,520
time you have which might be no free

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,450
time if like being you've got a toddler

00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,060
at home to look after and you try and

00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,610
welcome when you're going to do it and

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:13,390
if you don't have enough time to do it

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:17,839
don't struggle on and do a terrible job

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:19,750
go back to them and renegotiate or if

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,130
you don't have enough time to do it and

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,890
you're not that fussed about the job

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:28,839
well that's don't bother doing it put

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:32,440
your time into getting a better job whoo

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:36,350
that's my advice to first look at the

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:41,060
timings of it and if you get your

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:43,880
timings right and barring not doing

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,740
these no no's you probably have stand a

00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,850
good chance of passing the coding

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,860
challenge so here am I know knows not

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,320
actually doing the challenge by which I

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,760
mean you haven't read the instructions

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,279
and you do something completely

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,500
different even if you've written really

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,209
good code and I've had code submitted to

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,850
me which was really good and impressive

00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:07,579
but it it was like the person hadn't

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,320
read the actual challenge or you get

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:11,510
stuff that's submitted and it looks

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,480
alright but it just doesn't compile or

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:19,670
do anything so the first thing is to

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:26,060
actually do it yeah okay you need it to

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:28,339
actually work okay here's the one that

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,770
happens a surprising amount and it comes

00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,750
from a good place and you'll be reading

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,510
the code and someone's really try to

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,730
make it readable because it's they want

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,850
the person reading it to understand so

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:43,070
they put in lots of comments like loads

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:48,560
in the input above a function called

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:51,260
loads input and it's coming from a good

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,209
place but where it looks it reads this

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,209
immature code when you read it so don't

00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:57,649
do that if possible instead try and look

00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:01,310
at how you can get your code to self

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:04,040
documents as much as possible jumbled

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,280
code so often with these challenges

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,950
versus Corbitt

00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,470
which is some algorithm or some problem

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:14,530
that you're solving so don't mess that

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,400
up with all like input/output passing or

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:20,290
something like that

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:22,030
have-have the nice stuff there so your

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,580
your reviewer can reader I mean that

00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:28,360
kind of goes for all coding really try

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,700
and put the meaty stuff there and try

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:36,550
and factor out all the the annoying

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:38,050
stuff no unit tests so it's going to

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,700
depend on your reviewers they're going

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,520
to have a list of criteria of what they

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,620
want but some reviewers won't tell you

00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,450
about it but they'll just fail you

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,350
automatically if you don't have unit

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:55,210
tests especially if your job description

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:56,980
has TDD unit yeah you want to write unit

00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,260
tests otherwise you'll just be an

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,090
automatic fail but plus side of this is

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,530
if you have unit test you can make sure

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,710
that you've actually done the challenge

00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,990
and your code is actually working and

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:10,060
your front-end developers and you can do

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,460
unit test but sometimes it would be less

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,500
easy than the meal with my back-end

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,450
development right so I don't know if

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,330
there's things like maybe selenium you

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,490
could use to something to prove that it

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,530
works so as long as you don't do those

00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,170
things you've got your timing worked out

00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:28,540
yeah you should you should be okay with

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,040
this some other tips if you have to

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,740
write in a language you're not quite

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,240
comfortable in consider writing it in

00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,160
your first language that you're most

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,470
comfortable in and then rewriting it in

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,480
a different language it might not work

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,890
in every situation but by writing it in

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,870
your comfortable language you get to

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,550
work out your algorithms and everything

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,680
beautifully without bothering about

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,170
worrying about syntax and then you do a

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,560
conversion it's just something to

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,150
consider once you've submitted they're

00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,800
going to want to talk to you about your

00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:02,050
code so you're worth a bit of this as

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,839
you go along you can write notes about

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,820
trade-offs you made decisions you may

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,170
just say that you're armed with notes

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,910
when you have that discussion

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:16,980
oh okay those are my only things next

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:21,250
section how am i doing the time okay

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:24,250
technical quizzes does anyone remember

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:30,190
blockbusters or my just like really okay

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:32,410
KITT so my top tip is revised so you're

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:35,140
going to go to an interview for a

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,090
JavaScript developer Google interview

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,280
questions that a JavaScript developers

00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:43,870
kiss what will come happen is like 20

00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:46,600
questions will come up and they're

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:49,120
normally pretty short answers to just

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,180
refresh your memory so it's all there in

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,400
your ramp to say that when you go into

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:58,470
the test you can just come up with the

00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,640
answer and interviewers aren't that

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:04,720
imaginative when it comes to tests they

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:07,720
have probably googled the questions to

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:12,580
ask themselves yeah someone's not doing

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:16,750
totally happens so you know revised top

00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:19,690
tip if you get a question you don't know

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:23,440
the answer to you can explain what you

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:26,440
do know so if they say oh what's acid

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,320
when you're talking about relational

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,270
databases and you can remember that the

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,880
a means atomic and you can kind of

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,070
vaguely explain that do that and then

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,140
don't worry about the CID bits you can

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:43,630
just they are not quite sure about the C

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:45,370
I do I can't remember what they mean but

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,410
at least it's better than sitting there

00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,460
going oh I don't know just explain what

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:54,160
you do know if you get a question you

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,680
don't know the answer to ask what the

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,290
answer is and if you don't understand it

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,730
ask for an explanation I mean it's going

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,260
to show you you're interested and it

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,300
means you're going to learn something

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:09,190
but I'll hopefully be useful for next

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:11,710
time this is one once you've done a few

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,350
of them because they're all quite

00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:18,570
similar you can get quite bored being

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:21,310
the interviewee in these situations and

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:24,070
so don't get bored and derail the

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,250
process so I have been interviewed for a

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,510
Java development job and

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:31,240
decided in the middle of one of these

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,860
box standard technical tests to try and

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,760
persuade the guy that they should get

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:42,339
rid of inheritance in Java and just have

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,899
just have interfaces which is actually

00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:46,779
something you could argue but not in

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:49,720
that situation and I was doing the

00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,100
interview because it was for a friend

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,620
who worked then he wanted me to

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,880
interview there and he said the guy

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,390
turned me down because I was too

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,519
challenging which is true right so if

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,980
you do get bored to just think to

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:06,310
yourself have a good grace this is just

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:09,790
a tick boxing exercise and do it nicely

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,980
and don't get derail everything okay

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:16,180
whiteboard challenges are horrific right

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:18,850
well I think so so my top tip is to

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:22,029
practice by this I mean try and

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:25,360
replicate the conditions that you

00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:29,320
anticipate discovering a new interview

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:32,020
at home as closely as possible so get a

00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:35,320
big Pitters piece of paper stick it on

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:39,190
the wall get a friend or a rubber duck

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,350
if needs be but a friend and get them to

00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,720
ask you a question that you've googled

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:46,600
off the internet if you're going to a

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,720
major company you can Google Google

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:53,050
Facebook interview questions you can do

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,630
that and then get them to ask you the

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:58,089
question and you can practice doing it

00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,779
on the whiteboard and speaking aloud

00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:04,059
your thoughts as you go and this will

00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:05,980
hopefully make you feel feel less

00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,319
uncomfortable once you actually get to

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,650
doing it because the main challenge of

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,720
whiteboard things this week it's a bit

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,280
unusual I mean not very many people in

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,790
the rate what they're doing is they're

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,380
thinking I think most people go another

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,740
cup of tea and a little think and then

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:27,429
come back don't they but yes and the

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,610
idea of drawing yeah so practice it as

00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:34,710
best you can

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:38,840
the second tip they will explain to you

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:42,240
a problem if you don't understand it

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,240
keep us talking to them until you do

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,160
understand it because what happens is

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,810
you feel awkward you're like I don't

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,010
understand this I don't want to seem

00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,110
really stupid

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,780
so maybe what I can do is I can start

00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,520
drawing stuff and they'll say stuff and

00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,970
then I'll figure out what the question

00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,280
is

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,650
whilst doing the answer at the same time

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,740
which that's a recipe for disaster

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:07,350
that's never going to work so no matter

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,150
how awkward it is make sure you

00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,460
definitely understand the problem to

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,140
begin with if you're doing interviews

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,150
actually for sure does a thing with

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:19,370
whiteboard challenges if we do them not

00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:22,020
for overalls we give the interview we

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,000
print out of a problem first and leave

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,210
them alone to have a think about it and

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,610
then come back in to ask them so if

00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,490
you're giving giving out these

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:35,010
challenges that might be a way of

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:37,550
alleviating this problem slightly but

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,840
yeah no matter how awkward if you if you

00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,700
don't quite understand it you could say

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,800
well I don't quite understand it do you

00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,690
mean and then draw out what you do

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:51,180
understand and see how close you are

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,010
narrate your thinking so this is really

00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,050
important because the interviewer

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,600
doesn't give you a challenge and then

00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,970
leave the room with you there with a

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,490
whiteboard drawing away and then come

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,070
back and go okay let's have a look at

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,560
your whiteboard that's not what happens

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,050
because they want to see you thinking as

00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,970
you go along and the idea is that then

00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:16,490
they can get some insight into your mind

00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:19,560
I don't know if that's true but anyway

00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:25,200
narrate your thinking and if you feel

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:29,310
uncomfortable doing that practice so

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:33,360
another thing to remember is your

00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:35,190
interviewer wants to help you so even

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,110
though it's quite hard to be thinking of

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,210
technical details at the same time as

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,250
kind of having your social brain

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,420
switched on well I find it hard to

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,770
parallel lives or to

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,210
you should try and have empathy with

00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,580
your interviewer because they'll be

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,050
giving you hints so you should be open

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,930
and listening to them they're trying to

00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:59,310
help you it can be a bit ridiculous

00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:04,080
sometimes it feels like sharad but yeah

00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:06,870
try and help them to help you and this

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,570
is a good tip if you get told to do

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,080
something for 20 or n or anything like

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,150
that

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:17,280
start with 1 and then 2 and then 3

00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:19,440
so whatever you're doing try and do

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,910
something easier if there's something

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,190
about the problem they're giving you

00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:26,310
which is hard go well it's really hard

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:28,380
if you have this but you know what would

00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:31,020
make it easier is let's try and do it

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,820
for this easier case first and bla bla

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,470
bla and even if you don't get anywhere

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,730
it shows some sort of logical approach

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:43,290
to problems right so that's my top tip

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:44,760
for the whiteboard challenges and when

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,490
you're writing code whatever you do

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,020
don't worry about perfect code if your

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,840
interviewer is bothered about your

00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,600
writing perfect syntax on a whiteboard

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,630
that's a red flag about them in my book

00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:03,750
so you should maybe consider not working

00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:07,740
for them yeah ok that was it for that so

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:10,950
I think I'll give you maybe like my top

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,920
tip my one my first tip for technical

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:17,580
interviews and then we'll finish right

00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:20,040
so my first one is you know the

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,930
old-fashioned idea when your interview

00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,730
is there and they're going to grill you

00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,550
and put you under pressure and really

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:29,280
test you well when technical

00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:32,040
interviewers it's interviews it's really

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,710
not like that nowadays in fact they're

00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:37,560
trying desperately hard to get you to

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:40,410
show off all your brilliant nests so

00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,940
that you say that they can then hire you

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,190
because you're brilliant that's what

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,690
they want so in the course of

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,590
interviewing they'll ask you things like

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,630
Oh

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:53,700
tell me about something you've done that

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:55,560
you're really proud of or well I know

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,910
it's sort of embarrassing answering that

00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,320
one

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:02,780
or they'll say they'll look at your CV

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,150
and pick stuff that they feel it's going

00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,830
to be really comfy ground for you so

00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,500
they'll go oh I see you've worked a lot

00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,900
of both X can you tell me all about X

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,310
because I haven't worked over a lot so

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,440
they're trying to get you to show off

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:19,040
see if they're trying to get you to show

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:23,750
off show off you know it's a gift from

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,800
them so take it and they'll enjoy the

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,230
interview have a lot more if you're

00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,050
happy so they want you to be happy and

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:32,230
so that's my top tip for that and I'm

00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:38,269
done I think thank you all very much

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:38,269
