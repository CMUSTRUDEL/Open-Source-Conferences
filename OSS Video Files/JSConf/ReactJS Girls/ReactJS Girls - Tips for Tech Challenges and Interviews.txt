	Tips for Tech Challenges and Interviews

Emily Green (https://stories.pusher.com/@emilymaygreen) - Software Engineer @ Pusher (https://twitter.com/pusher)

Take-home coding tasks, whiteboard challenges, and technical interviews are all an inevitable part of getting hired as a developer. I've worked as a developer for 15 years, and have done quite a lot of these things from both sides of the table. Using this experience I've collected together a bunch of practical tips and ideas for how to best tackle these technical challenges, and how to cope when things don't go so well.

About Emily:

I'm Emily Green and I'm a developer at Pusher. In the past I've spoken about functionality programming (mostly Haskell), data and distributed databases, taught a one-day course called "7 languages in 7 hours" for General Assembly, dressed as an Ancient Greek to talk about Paxos to Papers We Love, and led a workshop at SPA conference where people built their own distributed databases. I co-founded the Fun(ctional) Club in Berlin, and co-organised GeekGirlMeetup in London and Berlin
