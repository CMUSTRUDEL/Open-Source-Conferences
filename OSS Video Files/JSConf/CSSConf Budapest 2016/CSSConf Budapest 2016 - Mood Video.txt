you

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,650
what I love about working in web

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,720
development specifically the front end

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,700
is that it's constantly moving and

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,100
evolving there's always new things to

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,330
learn and I think that's something you

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,920
can't say about a lot of other

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,510
professions every now and then you have

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,360
another framework on other technology or

00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,310
something completely changes like gay

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,690
location just available under secure

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,300
connections for instance which wasn't

00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,920
there before but even with the constant

00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,500
changes around you have a way to to

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,790
build a robust and resilient

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,470
architecture and structure to overcome

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,690
those changes when I code something I

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,479
can see the fruits of my labor right

00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,160
away I love hitting the refresh button I

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,899
like the opportunity to continue

00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,390
learning because it is an ever-changing

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,310
environment at the hands we host online

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,350
portfolios so it's awesome being able to

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,539
make like a positive measurable impact

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,950
on people's lives I love that I get to

00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:04,170
meet people I get to travel I get to

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,200
talk about things I get to go and have a

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,509
drink you know coffee and discuss ideas

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,410
and maybe next year we will be talking

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,410
about something completely different

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,640
the assistance for cascading style

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,560
sheets CSS stands for centering

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,840
sometimes CSS from me stands for

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,790
wellness the last bit of elegance and

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,490
finesse and let the old man's son was

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,020
saying centring stuff sometimes but it's

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,450
a my talk was all about how we've fixed

00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,130
that with flex box and grid so hopefully

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,250
we can send stuff all the time when we

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,920
want it clever smart and stunning people

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,880
can sleep soundly because i know that

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,610
i'm using web standards and that i'm

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,400
quoting in a way that is faster download

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,990
easy to understand and also that people

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,230
can take a look at and learn from my

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,230
code

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,959
