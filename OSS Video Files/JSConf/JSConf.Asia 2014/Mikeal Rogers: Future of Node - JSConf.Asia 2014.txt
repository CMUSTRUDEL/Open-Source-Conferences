Title: Mikeal Rogers: Future of Node - JSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2014-12-15
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	The node community has change tremendously as it has evolved over the last 5 years. Some of the most modern and progressive practices in open source are being tested to great success in this relatively new and dynamic community. While the core project has struggled to release and attract new contributors perhaps the future of node lies not in its central project but in the community that is continuing to grow and flourish.

Mikeal is the Director of Evangelism at DigitalOcean and the creator of request, NodeConf and JSFest.

JSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 20 + 21 November 2014.

I'll turn my camera on my fingers early

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:21,270
last year I actually started looking at

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,240
all of the open-source ecosystems that

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,220
we have any kind of data on and by

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,570
ecosystem I mean people that are

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,090
publishing packages in that language

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,890
that other people can use and so you can

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,180
get some data from github but the really

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,579
good data actually just comes out of the

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,620
package managers and what I started

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,379
doing was asking certain questions of

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,640
this data then nobody was really asking

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,730
and people are making a lot of

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,010
assumptions about the most important one

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,110
being you know is is growth somewhat

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,300
stable and predictable can we actually

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,739
predict that growth and then if it is

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,260
predictable than what does that actually

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,829
tell us about how the source ecosystems

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,680
grow one thing that I did that actually

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,420
worked really well was rather than start

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,510
charting the absolute number of packages

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,369
and focusing on that I charted growth as

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,619
a percentage of the ecosystem as a whole

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,020
so you know if you had a thousand

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,670
packages and you added 100 you would

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,530
have ten percent growth and if you had

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,720
10,000 packages and you added 100 you

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,369
would have one percent growth and then

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,960
the next quarter the next time that you

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,000
measure the growth it's going to be you

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,070
know what that much harder to reach that

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,229
growth again and so what you would

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,000
expect is that all of the ecosystems

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,409
with those numbers would be coming down

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,210
right it's getting harder and harder to

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,650
grow at that rate and certainly some

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,509
open source ecosystems are dying

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,340
certainly some of them people are you

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,320
know not really that into you know like

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,340
come on like nobody writes Haskell that

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,590
Haskell is like dying right and but

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,990
actually what I found was was pretty

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,240
startling it turns out that no

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,380
open-source ecosystem is dying it turns

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,049
out that all of them are actually

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,110
growing at a pretty sustainable raid I

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,700
mean they do fall a little bit but over

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,219
a couple years you're looking at a half

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,229
to two percent right but some are

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,640
growing dramatically more than others

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,020
and that led me to disprove to like

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,000
really important assumptions that we've

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,790
been making for a long time

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,830
one was that you know these numbers were

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,580
unpredictable you know they are they're

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:25,180
actually very predictable this this

00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,310
graph I took that those numbers those uh

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,590
basically the average growth per quarter

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,560
and I'm striking it out for the next

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:38,239
three years at the time so this goes to

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,910
the end of next year and Isaac texted me

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,519
the other day and told me that last

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,500
month we we went over a hundred thousand

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,349
packages and node last month and this

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,000
predicts it about down to the day and

00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:51,950
this was made in April this graph has

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
made in april of last year so about a

00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,310
year and a half afterwards it's holding

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,170
very very true so if it continues to

00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,160
hold true for about a year we're going

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,329
to be you know close to 300,000 packages

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,480
we're going to be double the size of

00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:06,590
Ruby that's that's pretty tremendous but

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,620
the other more important assumption that

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,750
this totally destroyed was that um oh

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,819
the growth of one ecosystem is at the

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,920
expense of another that when note grows

00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,569
it's because people are ditching Python

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,730
and they're ditching Ruby and you know

00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,840
there or you know when go is growing

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,579
it's because people are jumping ship

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,239
from node because you know TJ wrote a

00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:28,670
blog post and this is actually not true

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,160
it turns out that open source ecosystem

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,139
growth almost entirely comes from what

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,760
you could call non-consumption right so

00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,049
that's non consumption in terms of

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,389
people that are writing code and not

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,519
publishing open source packages so if

00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:42,349
you make it easier and you have a

00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,910
culture of participation where people

00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:45,859
want to publish and they're incentivize

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,510
to publish then they will so you get a

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,459
lot of growth out of that and then you

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,590
also get a lot of growth out of what you

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,359
could call a mature ization so taking a

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,549
task that used to be only accessible to

00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:57,139
a couple really smart programmers that

00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,120
knew how like b-trees worked and

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:01,010
stuff and then you make it super simple

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,510
and easy for almost anybody to use

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,519
including you know high school dropouts

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,200
and then you know they make awesome

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,400
websites with it and really creative

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,489
stuff that people who know how b-trees

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,630
work could never do and and so like

00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:13,130
that's that's really important because

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,269
if you're trying to grow an ecosystem

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,729
you need to learn these lessons about

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,280
how things actually grow so I was paying

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:20,570
attention to this graph for a long time

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,000
containing attention to the massive

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,650
growth of node you know now we are by

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,780
far the largest ecosystem

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,820
in the world we're still the fastest

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,240
growing ecosystem in the world although

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,600
packages being bringing PHP up there so

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,630
PHP is having another growth spurt again

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,979
no mumbles it's still okay I think stuff

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,380
all right but what I wasn't paying

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:45,979
attention to with until recently was

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:49,850
this graph this is the contributions to

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:52,910
node core graph and it is decidedly not

00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,800
growing you know you can see that over

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,949
the last couple years we've had sort of

00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,350
a smaller decline and then last year a

00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,840
pretty huge decline in the last looks

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:06,380
like two or three months we're getting

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,660
pretty close to zero and considering

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,520
that we have the largest ecosystem in

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,990
the world we have you know we're the

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,430
fastest growing use in the world there

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,830
are a lot of incentives for people to

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,349
want to contribute to node and they're

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,320
not there they are decidedly not

00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:22,940
contributing to it and this is this is

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,880
about the problem but also you know like

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,949
why you know we have this great project

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,380
people are clearly using it why aren't

00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,970
people could have been decorum another

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,680
more concerning even more concerning

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,110
graph is this one this is the number of

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,430
stable releases per year of node so you

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,320
can see that even all the way through

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,909
2013 we're doing a lot of stable

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,250
releases I mean this includes patch

00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:45,289
releases right so bug fixes and security

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,300
fixes and that kind of stuff and then

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,430
this year we have just this huge decline

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,669
I mean there's a month left of this year

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,039
but it's not going up much and you know

00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,930
we we had two huge security problems

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,940
this year right like two huge security

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,070
like SSL fixes that had to go out so

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,680
that's you know two of these seven or

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,240
eight releases so we're also not

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,539
releasing so the code that is getting in

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,010
we're not getting it out the door people

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:11,300
are starting to kind of wonder like what

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,639
the hell is going on with this project

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:18,949
and you know if I were to show you the

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,599
NPM update graph which is the number of

00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,010
updates to packages so not just new

00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:23,780
publishes like we saw in the previous

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,460
graph but also people continuing to

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,169
maintain an update packages it actually

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,690
see that that growth that graph grows

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:31,940
even faster than the number of packages

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,580
like new packages published so you know

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,729
updates to things and continuing stable

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,069
releases inside of the eCos

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:41,550
is growing tremendously and then it's

00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:43,949
not happening in code core so if we want

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,409
to fix this we have to figure out what

00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:49,020
works what is working in the ecosystem

00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:50,849
that we're all participating in that's

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,879
growing like crazy that now has you know

00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:56,729
100,000 modules and what parts of that

00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,809
are not true for core and let's make

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,599
them true for it so that we can

00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:03,479
potentially fix this so this is a

00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,539
visualization a simple simplified

00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:10,199
visualization of the level up ecosystem

00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:12,839
and there's a lot of other ecosystems

00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,240
inside of NPM that look a lot like this

00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,469
right you could look at some of the

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,759
stuff to McCullough sheng co does with

00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,550
ndarray and it would look a lot like

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,539
this as well where you have sort of

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,949
layers of different modules that

00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,330
accomplish different tasks and then they

00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:27,839
sort of have these different dependency

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:29,309
chains on top of them and in a lot of

00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,319
cases actually there is this sort of

00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:33,029
linchpin module the module that sort of

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,539
like is at the center of this little

00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:38,939
ecosystem and when you when you really

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,409
break down npm where you find are lots

00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:41,759
of different clusters of things and

00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,990
sometimes they're around something like

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,270
level up but sometimes they're just

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,399
around a person right like you know some

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,749
stack and dominic tar and max ogden like

00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,610
they they have a bunch of modules that

00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:52,259
they use together in certain ways really

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,439
often and they form this little sort of

00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,149
ecosystem but there's a few things you

00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,449
need to know about this right like one

00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:03,209
is that all of these independent modules

00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:05,279
are run by different people there's a

00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:07,319
certain amount of ownership that goes

00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:11,459
along with these smaller kind of single

00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,990
maintainer modules and they they're

00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,399
basically able to operate completely

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,479
independent of each other so nobody's

00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,550
anybody's boss nobody owns anybody else

00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,959
and the only time that that isn't really

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,270
the case is in this level up module

00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,919
right level up actually is in a similar

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,089
position to what you can call a node

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,479
core is right like a lot of people

00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:33,870
depend on it on both sides of the stack

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:36,120
and so it should exhibit a lot of the

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,469
same problems the core does but it

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,180
actually doesn't so this is a really

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,349
good thing to look at and to try and

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,870
figure out you know ways that we might

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:45,750
improve note in the future so this is

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,740
rod bag rod is the creator of level up

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:52,240
and is still one of the the prime

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:54,850
maintain errs a really great guy great

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,260
addition to the note community you'll

00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,899
see his name pop up a lot the more that

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,089
you get into things but Rob decided to

00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,620
run the project very very differently

00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:05,589
than we've seen a lot of open source

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,750
project from before any key came up with

00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:09,760
this new system that he called open open

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,779
source I don't think that the acronym

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,580
actually means anything he just

00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:17,380
capitalizes it to reinforce the fact

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:19,060
that his open open source open

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,730
up this is the first line of the

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,170
contributing file for for it and that

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,060
this is the description of open open

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,080
source which is that at individuals

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,820
making significant and valuable

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,140
contributions are given commit access to

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,200
the project to contribute as they see

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:34,000
fit this project is more like an open

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,320
wiki than a standard guarded open source

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,920
project so it turns out that get is like

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,630
really good at removing mistakes you

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,160
can't screw up get the way that you can

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,470
screw up like a subversion repository

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,240
and a lot of these crazy kind of

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,589
safeguards and hierarchies that we have

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,180
around giving people commit access

00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:54,070
they're really not that warranted

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,260
anymore when we can revert things so

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,450
simply and easily right like we may want

00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,640
to guard the keys to doing releases and

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,200
pushing releases to NPM but in terms of

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,290
like actually guarding commit access

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,420
that's not all that necessary and so he

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,610
sort of figured this out he added this

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,350
to the project he started just giving

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,970
commitment to anybody that sent a patch

00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,240
that was more than four or five lines

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:19,180
long and what ended up happening was a

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,149
lot of people including me dominic tar

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:24,430
and Palo Fragomeni and all of the people

00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:26,860
that sort of depend on level up on every

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,570
side of this ecosystem they all got

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,130
commit access and they all had a shared

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:34,600
sense of responsibility for the project

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:35,649
and it's it's easy to con somebody into

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,899
having a shared sense of responsibility

00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:39,010
for some time you know you can say like

00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,779
oh you know I really believe in you

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,640
write this stuff and then but if you

00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:45,670
don't give them ownership over it if you

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,470
don't like if you don't treat the if you

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,240
don't act as a participant yourself if

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,470
you don't come with a pull request just

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,390
like everybody else and you sort of

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,800
continue to act like a dictator people

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,170
start to understand that they actually

00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,180
don't have any ownership over this and

00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,560
their participation will go down a lot

00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,779
and their sense of responsibility over

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,760
the project will go down quite a bit and

00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:05,410
and for the people that don't do that

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,480
they'll just burn themselves out I mean

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,310
look though they'll get so care mad

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,570
about everything that happens and

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,670
they'll sort of flip out and it's all

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:16,270
because they they feel a lack of control

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,890
over their own work and this model that

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,149
rod came up with has been hugely

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,620
successful in avoiding all these

00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:22,420
pitfalls you know there's a heap there's

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,690
an amazing active and engaged community

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,250
that shares ownership over the project

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,500
and it's it maintained very very

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,970
responsibly without you know all these

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,770
crazy safeguards that we sort of obsess

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:37,260
over okay so um can talk a little bit

00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,820
about notes cool so a lot of people have

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,890
been doing notes cool we there was one

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,630
here people talked about new schools lot

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:48,459
notes cool it really sort of came out of

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:53,380
out of the out of the note conferences

00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:56,350
so note comp 2012 sub stack wrote this

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,839
little stream adventure workshop room in

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,370
fact we heard for that year I decided

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,380
that note comp was just going to be all

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,270
hands on and so most people just

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,520
collaborated on building slides in a

00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,170
whole curriculum and sub-sect tried to

00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,839
do that for about five minutes before he

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,670
flipped out and was like screw this no

00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,290
and like and then he's like I'm just

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,790
going to run a module and so he writes

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,820
this module that's you know an

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:21,700
interactive workshop that was by far the

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,339
best workshop that year everybody really

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,529
loved it to moxley love the rod bag

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,860
loved it so much that when he went to to

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:33,040
moxies conference camp j/s a few months

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,100
later he he rewrote all of his workshop

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,910
materials in a very similar format so

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,920
that you could have this sort of

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,750
interactive presentation style and then

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,980
a few months later at node comfy you

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,140
there's you know five of these

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,730
interactive workshops and we put them

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,000
all under this banner and call it note

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,190
school and it really took off from there

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,020
and then shortly after that i created

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,300
this issue and this is like my favorite

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,540
github issue in the history of open

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,070
source it's so great so like I just sort

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:03,190
of put together resources for people

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,279
running localized node schools in their

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,990
town or whatever

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,910
and I said you know hey run one you know

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,339
when you're done like totally come back

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:14,339
and tell us all about it and so and this

00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,870
thread just blew up for months so tons

00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,370
of people were running these they were

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,050
coming back and saying what worked and

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,360
what didn't work we were all inter ating

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,589
on how we did them and you know people

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,510
started sending in all these awesome

00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:27,240
photos and attaching them to the issue

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,769
as well so you know these are from and

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,320
these are from all over the world I mean

00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:34,079
you know you got London and China and

00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,779
Australia I think there's a little bit

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,329
of San Francisco in there Columbia like

00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,500
they've met een Columbia's in there and

00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:43,320
this is all happening within like the

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,690
first few months and we were so excited

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,750
that we we kind of didn't notice when

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,610
growth kind of plateaued like we had a

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,010
bunch of new people come and run them

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,420
and then we we basically exhausted I

00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:58,190
guess the number of people that could

00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:01,200
just figure this out from that issue and

00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:03,390
it stagnated for a little while and then

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,959
you know max Ogden who you may have seen

00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:08,670
earlier he decided that he was going to

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,200
sort of like take on some more

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,000
leadership and organize things a bit and

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,790
what he did was one he just documented

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,860
very very well how to run a note school

00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,360
you know you don't need it any money you

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,850
don't need to pay for pizza and beer

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,290
unless you want to like just you know

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,740
it's very very simple you know here are

00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:28,980
these materials that's it but then he he

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:31,529
found a way to adopt to adapt rod begs

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,839
open open source to this like new

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:34,950
growing community of note schools

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,779
because one of the problems that you

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,860
have in distributing this project is

00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,740
like well how do you share ownership

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,149
over something that is literally global

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,760
and people are running them in their

00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:46,200
local acts in their local community so

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,050
you created this note school github org

00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,790
and basically anybody who comes along

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,709
and says I want to run a new node school

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,230
they get added as an owner of the entire

00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:57,510
org and then from there they create a

00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,250
repo for their local node school chapter

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:02,250
which you know means that they get a

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,050
website and and also that github repo

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,180
ends up being an issue tracker for them

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,820
to organize the event and for anybody

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,320
that was at the event to follow up later

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,380
and then then he did something just

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,240
 genius he he told them that at

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,740
the end of every node school they should

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,340
get the github handles of everybody who

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,140
attended

00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,360
and add them as an owner of the

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,160
individual repository so now they're all

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,160
watching the repo they're all following

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,570
up and it makes this line between I just

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,280
learn node I know a little bit more

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,650
about node now I'm helping out to run a

00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,480
node school now I'm entering it makes

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,510
that continuum and that transition so

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,750
simple and easy and it ended again it

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,520
shares ownership of the localized event

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,990
which means that people have a shared

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,940
sense of responsibility for keeping it

00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,370
running it's really genius there's

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,320
worked incredibly well and now we're i'm

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,730
on the owners thread so I know about

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,230
every single one that comes in and it's

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,180
like two or three a week or being added

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,770
it's crazy and then you know I have to

00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,720
unsubscribe from this repo because it's

00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:03,270
like all in Japanese and and and and

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,560
just recently you know Max's been on a

00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,570
kick of trying to get everybody to

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,940
translate as well so there's a ton of

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,530
translations for the node school website

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,120
trying to translate all the work

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,500
shoppers there's a new concerted effort

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,070
to try and distribute ownership of that

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,590
as well it's going really really well

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:23,150
another thing max put together in in

00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:25,530
Oakland the the hometown of node is

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,150
Oakland Jas so the reason I bring this

00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,160
up is that you know there's everybody's

00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,080
been to a meetup probably meet it's very

00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,450
common Oakland Jace is just a little bit

00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,270
different it's not a thing where people

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:39,390
go and talk or pitch there's no speak

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,790
there's no speakers at all we we have it

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,500
at the sort of the outdoor beer garden

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:45,660
and it's just a place for people to come

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,700
and relax and sort of continued to build

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,950
a community over a long period of time

00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,100
and the secret to its success is that we

00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:55,260
do it every week and so nobody is there

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,880
every time nobody is even in charge of

00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,380
making it happen it just happens every

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,150
week and people just show up every week

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,250
and you don't have to feel weird about

00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,810
not showing up or showing up again but

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,940
one thing that this is started to do is

00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:08,310
that for the first time we're attracting

00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,850
a lot of non-programmers into

00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:13,650
programming into this local community um

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:16,290
because one thing that we we found out

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:19,410
through the note schools is that people

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:22,080
if people can reach out to someone that

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,400
they've met they're far more likely to

00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,110
follow up if they're really new to

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,439
programming there's certain things that

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:30,320
are just terrifying to ask online

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,029
in fact one thing that the local node

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,710
school chapter started doing that I've

00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:35,299
been stealing really liberally is that

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,820
they started creating get er chat rooms

00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:40,250
for their local node school and at first

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,529
I was like why like if people want help

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,600
they should just go to like a main node

00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,879
school one but no it's actually done

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,500
really well because people who will go

00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:49,850
to these local event they'll have a

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,259
question and they'll just be terrified

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,509
to ask it if anybody except the people

00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:55,940
that they just met at that meet up and

00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:58,129
so having sort of like you know weekly

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,620
informals and having you know these

00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:02,360
localized support systems really help us

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,860
bring in what will eventually be the

00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,899
next generation of new programmers write

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,039
like these are these are possibly people

00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:08,750
that aren't going to be full-time

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,250
programmers you know they're going to

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,720
work instead of government and they need

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,250
to process some data and they want to

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,110
know how to do that in a way that works

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,580
on the web or you know they work in

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,750
education and so they have an interest

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,730
in this and it's going to help them do

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,980
their job but you know they're not going

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,090
to work at a startup and that's

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,340
great because we don't need more

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:30,019
startups but we need or more where

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:32,029
people writing useful so but uh

00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:34,009
yeah so like these these are all just

00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:37,909
great day and like here's a couple more

00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:40,399
photos from from our local Oakland Jas

00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:41,929
and you know literally like we don't

00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:43,370
even have the same table each week

00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,049
because we don't have a reserve space so

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,580
people just have to kind of look around

00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:48,759
and try to figure out like where laptops

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:51,289
are and then it's like oh hey you are

00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:52,490
and I started bringing like those little

00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:54,320
bits and now we're playing with those

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,769
all the time but it's just been really

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,210
fun and we noticed people coming back

00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,370
week after week that just would never

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,070
come to a meet up and we're really

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,710
pulling them into this into this

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,120
community and we never would have been

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,700
able to get them any other way so I

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,500
highly suggest doing something like this

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:16,789
but ok so the future right this is

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:21,889
future town so what what is the future

00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:23,059
of node look like that's what the talk

00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:25,070
is supposed to be about so I better

00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:28,580
bring back around so the future of note

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:30,669
is it's actually you in that you know

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,899
node is a participatory culture

00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,730
everything that we've succeeded at we've

00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:36,470
succeeded at because we have a brita

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,299
saboteur II culture and because we've

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,710
been amateur izing these these tasks and

00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:41,400
now we have to move on to the next phase

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,680
of that which means like all of

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,750
you need to participate and all of you

00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,540
need to to get involved in ways that you

00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,040
know we have some examples of before but

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,540
you know we need to find new ways to

00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,990
collaborate in new ways to get involved

00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:57,480
so the first izle is you know local like

00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,460
if you don't have a community in your

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,530
town you can build one if you do have a

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,330
little one you can grow it you can make

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,610
it more cohesive and it's really not

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,950
that hard and there's now a lot more

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:10,290
resources so you can run a note school

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,600
there's incredibly detailed information

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,310
on how to run a note school I mean

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,010
literally you know dozens of people are

00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,750
running them every month you know all of

00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,880
the workshop or materials are there for

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,650
you to use it's it's a really and it's a

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,910
really great experience to be a mentor

00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,830
and to teach people things you'll

00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:29,670
actually learn a lot by teaching other

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,170
people if you if you if you know you

00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,730
have a bit more of a community you want

00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,650
to bring in some you know out of town

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:37,260
speakers and really get people in your

00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,990
city or town excited about about note

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,340
and about JavaScript I started doing

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,880
this thing called node cough one shot

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:47,670
and I liberally stole from what max did

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,650
with notes cool and essentially

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,750
documented how to run a very simple very

00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,190
stripped down one day conference it

00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,020
doesn't cost a lot of money it's not

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,910
that hard there's instructions on there

00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,860
on how to do a really great CFP and how

00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:01,950
to select good talks like you know

00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,530
really anybody can run these we were

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,580
going to do four of them this year

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:09,450
there's you know already two on the

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,710
books for next year so really if if you

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:15,060
feel like you want to step it up another

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,800
notch check out one shot okay and then

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,730
there's no forward which everybody's

00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:23,940
probably been waiting for me to talk

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:26,640
about so so note forward it's to get up

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,230
work that I created and a campaign that

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
a lot of people are now involved in

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,190
where we're really just trying to get no

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,620
decor back on track and not just knowed

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,090
core but we're trying to solve a lot of

00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,710
the problems inside of the note

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,020
community and ecosystems that aren't

00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,150
solvable with just one module right they

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,710
do require the collaboration of more

00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:49,580
people inside of the ecosystem and so

00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:52,740
some some great examples of this are

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,730
onboarding so new people come to

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,710
JavaScript and no

00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:00,450
and they land at API Docs and you can't

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,400
learn if you don't know anything

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,410
about note already it just by looking at

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,840
API Docs and there are a lot of great

00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,130
resources that people have built for for

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,440
learning JavaScript and for learning

00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,660
note I mean max Ogden wrote this amazing

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,670
one called jazz for cats that is

00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:17,630
literally you know a cat's guide to

00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:19,680
learning JavaScript it's adorable and

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,090
you know there's you know a node.js

00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,760
handbook and there's all these great

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,050
resources there's even knowed school but

00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,700
finding them and seeing them laid out in

00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,530
a cohesive way that says you know I

00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,920
would want to go and do this really

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,840
isn't there so Tracy Abrams and a bunch

00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,760
of other people are leading this really

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,960
great effort to sort of consolidate some

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,970
of this material and build a website

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,740
that is basically a landing page for new

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:44,370
node users that we can start pointing

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,230
people at and you know if you're into

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,520
documentation you're into usability you

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,680
know how to make pretty websites like

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,400
you can help out with this so just go to

00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,170
this repo and pitch in the next is help

00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,090
so I don't know if you've ever been on

00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:00,570
the node.js mailing list but is it's a

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:02,310
cesspool it's just it's the worst don't

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,390
go there just don't unless you want to

00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:08,040
know a lot about fibers it's so but and

00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,330
but people like legitimately show up

00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,550
with real questions and they're like

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:15,450
help me and then they'll learn about

00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:17,130
fibers instead and so we've been trying

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,120
to fix this for a long time I mean for

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,410
snowmobiles done a great job of

00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,030
moderating the mailing list but it's

00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:25,860
still just not like a super accessible

00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:27,570
thing so we created a github repo and

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,820
we're using the issue track you tracker

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,770
there for people to ask questions and

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,950
help but we also actually have a git er

00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,990
room because we vet we've found that get

00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,340
er just being on the web and being

00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,940
simple we're getting people that won't

00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,740
pop into IRC very simply very easily so

00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,690
if you want to help people you know you

00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,090
can you can watch this repo to provide

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,660
help for people you can pop into that

00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:53,220
Gator channel and help any new users out

00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,820
we're already getting a pretty good

00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,960
amount of people come popping in and

00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,500
forest is sort of leading that project

00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,580
along with some other people next one is

00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,810
one that I'm getting pretty excited

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,830
about because we've been talking about

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,450
it forever but it's

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,399
always kind of stalled out and I got

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,710
anywhere but now it's really happening

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:13,640
which is basically a sort of like global

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,809
open-source mentorship program so

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,519
essentially the idea is that you know a

00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,230
mentor signs up and says you know I know

00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,419
about this kind of stuff I can dedicate

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,130
about these many hours a week to helping

00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,779
out a new person and then they get on

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,100
you know Google hangout or a skype or

00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:29,159
whatever with new people that come along

00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:31,200
that want to learn more and one we sort

00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,730
of like build a lot better relationships

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,460
with newer people and pull them into the

00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,500
community like really deeply and also

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,860
it's just a good educational effort so

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,590
right now you can go to that repo and

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,480
then the readme has a list of mentors

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,750
and if you're up for mentoring then just

00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,919
send a pull request and add yourself and

00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,919
that's a great way that you can help out

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:58,019
then there's some core stuff so we have

00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:00,000
we have a discussions repo for any other

00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:01,289
problems that I haven't talked about or

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,789
any new issues there's already some

00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:05,519
threads there that are there barring

00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:07,409
some fruit one is the the first one that

00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,590
I added to the repo which is called all

00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:12,779
the maths but essentially I don't know

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,250
if you know this but are and sigh pie

00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,659
and all of these like crazy math

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,580
libraries that I had mex talk about

00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:19,559
they're basically just fortran code it's

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,880
just fortran code that they bind to and

00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:24,539
these four trim libraries are fine

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,940
ancient and i was like hey can we cross

00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:28,200
compile this like can we do something

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,970
how do we fix this and so we had a long

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,220
discussion about it and just recently

00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,929
because nobody could get em script in

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,850
with fortran support to install like sup

00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:37,889
one person he made a docker image for it

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,919
so now anybody can run this docker image

00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:43,289
and he actually cross compiled all of

00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,710
these ancient for like a la pack the

00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:50,309
this fortran mega library with M

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,600
scripting and and yeah so any other

00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:52,980
problems that you think you know the

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,840
noted community needs to address you

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,399
should bring up there it's also a really

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,480
nice repo to just watch and participate

00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:04,830
in another one which is also being run

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:08,309
by rod bag is build so the the current

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:09,899
build system for core is I think it

00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:11,190
might just be down or it's just not

00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:13,559
running or whatever but it's really not

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,299
that reliable so one we want like a

00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,850
better automated build system for core

00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,480
that runs all the tests we want to get

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,490
like you know

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,770
formas tests running we want to also

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,840
when for every build of core we should

00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,830
really be running like the npm tests and

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,660
we should really be running like the

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,460
tests of the most popular modules out

00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,440
there so we know that we're not breaking

00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,130
something on top of node not just note

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,510
itself and so and another thing is that

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,100
we want it to be really robust right

00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,290
like right right now it's all on like

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:43,230
one providers infrastructure and that's

00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:45,900
just not going to hold up so like almost

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,370
a dozen companies now have like given

00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,530
resources to this you know I gave some

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,970
digital ocean but you know voxer went

00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,040
and bought like Mac minis and put them

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,660
in a data center for Mac testing you

00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,880
know we're getting like freebsd stuff in

00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,200
there IBM and soft layer through and

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,780
some resources so we're getting a lot of

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:05,970
people into this right now it's um what

00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:10,020
is that awful Java thing some awful Java

00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:11,970
Sea I but rod can't use anything in Java

00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,160
for long too long before he regrets it

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,640
and node so there's there's also an

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,840
up-and-coming CI utility written a node

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,090
that will be probably switching to at

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,590
some point so you can go to that repo

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:28,380
and pitch in if you're like a build

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:30,059
person the roadmap so it's been a

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,630
complaint for as long as I've been

00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:35,760
working on node stuff that core is a

00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,710
very homogeneous group of people and

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,240
this because like you know to work on

00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,650
core most of the people especially the

00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,910
people that came early on came from kind

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,280
of server backgrounds and formerly

00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,900
low-level backgrounds and if you look at

00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,390
the growth like more than half of no

00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,220
juice issues in front and tooling and so

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,740
getting that feedback into the core

00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,210
group has been very difficult and it's

00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,280
been locked up in a lot of weird process

00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,110
so we have this roadmap repo where we're

00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,429
sort of like asking questions and coming

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,230
up with more creative ways of getting

00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:03,030
feedback from people so we can try to

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,710
figure out what are the biggest issues

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:07,049
that did people need addressed in core

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,240
so we can feed that into an eventual

00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:10,530
roadmap right but the the purpose of the

00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,390
project now and there's a couple threads

00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:15,210
on there you can participate in which is

00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,370
about figuring out what the biggest pain

00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:20,250
points are in node from every different

00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:22,770
part of the community so we can get all

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,510
that consolidated and the last one which

00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,669
is not actually on node forward but it's

00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:30,929
very important it's called man worst

00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:31,880
name ever rod but so if you use any like

00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:34,170
see live

00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,960
every major release of node they break

00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:39,900
because v8 dramatically changes its API

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,760
during every release and so what we're

00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,040
trying to do with nan does basically it

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,490
provides like enough surface area for

00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,810
most people to bind to that are doing

00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,570
like a native extension or a sea

00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,710
extension and it straddles the different

00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,260
versions of v8 that are in major

00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,430
releases of node and it's sort of like

00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,740
you know constantly getting like

00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,840
refactored and and there's a lot of work

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,490
going into it right now but what we're

00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,890
hoping is that this kind of eventually

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,560
become the unofficial sort of blessed

00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:09,930
way for you to do native add-ons if you

00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,760
can there's always going to be a section

00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,200
of the native like parts of native add

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,640
on that you may need to bind directly to

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,080
v8 but the more that you can use this

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,390
the less pain that you'll go through

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,100
during every major release of node and

00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,370
the less pain that you know everybody

00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,740
who uses your module will go through so

00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:29,040
that's sort of the summary of the the

00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,350
current work that's me I'm Michael

00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,140
Rogers and when I'm not running node

00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:37,340
events I'm the director of evangelism a

00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,340
digital ocean thank you
