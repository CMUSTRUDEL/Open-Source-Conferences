Title: Ritesh Angural: Lightning Branches - A Way to Supercharge Your Feature Delivery - JSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2014-12-15
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	I will be talking about the "No talk all action" approach we take at RedMart for feature development. You’ll learn how we supercharge development and get code in production fast with an opinionated and automated development workflow. Hint: It’s a cocktail of Git, JS (of course), Chef, Devops & killing pointless meetings.

Ritesh is an Engineer working on the next generation Ecommerce platform at RedMart, currently working on the frontend and continuous delivery. Apart from coding in JavaScript & Ruby, he loves extracting a perfect espresso & scoring goals while wearing the Juventus jersey!

JSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 20 + 21 November 2014.
