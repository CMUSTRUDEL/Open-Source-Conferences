Title: Spike Brehm: Building Isomorphic Apps (Updated) - JSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2014-12-18
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	Over the past year or so, we’ve seen the emergence of a new way of building JavaScript web apps that share code between the web browser and the server, using Node.js — a technique that has come to be known as "isomorphic JavaScript.” There are a variety of use cases for isomorphic JavaScript; some apps render HTML on both the server and the client, some apps share just a few small bits of application logic, while others share the entire application runtime between client and server to provide advanced offline and realtime features. Why go isomorphic? The main benefits are performance, maintainability, reusability, and SEO.
This talk will share examples of isomorphic JavaScript apps running in the wild, explore the exploding ecosystem of asset building tools, such as Browserify, Webpack, and Gulp, that allow developers to build their own isomorphic JavaScript apps with open-source libraries, demonstrate how to build an isomorphic JavaScript module from scratch, and explore how libraries like React and Flux can be used to build a single-page app that renders on the server.

Spike is a web engineer at Airbnb. He’s currently prototyping the next generation of Airbnb’s front end stack, tackling the problem of "isomorphic JavaScript" – building apps that have the flexibility to run on both the client and server using the same codebase.
