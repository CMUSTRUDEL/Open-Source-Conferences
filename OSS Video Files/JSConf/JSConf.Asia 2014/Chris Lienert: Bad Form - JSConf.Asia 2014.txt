He is currently working in the in-house web team at insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson in Perth, Australia Aside from musical distractions and earning frequent flyer points, Chris and his wife Sarah can often be found in the company of their very small human. 

The node community has change tremendously as it has evolved over the last 5 years.
