Title: Peggy Kuo: There and Back Again - A Game Dev's Tale - JSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2014-12-17
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	There are two main challenges in creating a game: starting, and finishing. With the plethora of tools at our disposal, it’s quite easy to embark on our pet projects. But sooner or later, we come across problems. Scope creep, unknown unknowns, fragile code and just life in general. It’s at this point that many games falter by the wayside and are eventually shelved. 
In this talk, I’ll take you through my journey of creating my game Trichroma, and share both the technical and non-technical lessons I learned along the way that enabled me to pull it over the finish line and bring it home.

Peggy is a full stack developer at Atlassian who loves creating things. She makes everything from stuffed toys to Android apps, and her latest project is a little game called Trichroma. She co-organises the Girl Geek Dinner and Women Who Code. But if you really want to know the way to her heart... that would be food!

JSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 20 + 21 November 2014.

i turn my camera on I could my fingers

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:19,939
on way so yes today I'm going to share

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,189
to you a bit of experience about Gaines

00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:26,430
aye lad that I'm not exactly an awesome

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,560
game developer I've made to gains one

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,029
which is very stupid and simple and the

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,410
other which I'm talking about is

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:36,510
hopefully bit better so firstly the

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,280
slides are going to be up on speaker

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,489
deck after the end of this talk so

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,559
they're not there yet but they will be

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:47,789
so a bit of an introduction about myself

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,010
I am as mentioned from australia sydney

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,710
where we're probably known for our opera

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,649
house and our beer and I work out

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,930
atlassian where there's beer on tap

00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:00,149
except I don't drink so I've been at

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,280
last year for the past five nearly six

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,680
years and I worked on various projects

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,900
and products in particular booked on

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,680
confluence some of you may have heard of

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,560
that now as a developer I think how jobs

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,360
are very creative and therefore I like

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,720
to create things and I think many of us

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,720
do here as well but I don't like to

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,090
create just computer programs and apps

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,220
in fact I like to sometimes venture away

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,670
from the computer and create things that

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,680
are a bit more tangible like soft toys

00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,750
but I find in the end I gravitate back

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,189
towards the laptop sitting in my room

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,680
coding away at some random idea I have

00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:44,610
so now that you know a bit about me let

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,740
us continue on our journey so before we

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,280
start on the journey let us start by

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,310
doing a quick survey with some audience

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,950
participation so put your hand up if

00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:00,420
you've wanted to make a game or have an

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,540
idea for a game come on yep so quite a

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,020
few now keep your hand up if you started

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,020
on this idea

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,240
bit more and keep your hand up if you've

00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,280
actually finished this idea and it's

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,890
published so that people who you do not

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,770
know can download and play this game

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,050
because I think we've got two people so

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,570
as you can see there's a bit of a

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,090
pattern here and that is as developers

00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,160
we like creating things and gains is one

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,530
of these things and I think the reason

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,450
for this is games is one of the rare

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,600
things that we can create that our

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,640
friends and family understand it might

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,390
be quite hard to explain to your friend

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,490
what a web torrent web RTC thing is they

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,070
might be like so I can stream videos

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,960
like youtube what's the difference but

00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,520
with games you give it to them and

00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,980
they'll be like oh cool I can play

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,110
flappy bird they understand exactly what

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,650
it's for without you trying to dumb it

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,990
down for them but the problem is there's

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,330
lots of ideas and we rare that they

00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,840
rarely see the light of day and I think

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,090
this is a huge problem mainly because as

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,370
developers I think we're all very

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,410
talented and skilled and we have the

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,989
ability to create these games that we

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,930
have in our mind but life gets in the

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,910
way and we rarely finish these ideas and

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,070
they just sort of either stay half

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,459
completed on a computer or worse yet

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,860
they stay in our mind going nowhere and

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:32,680
that is why today I want you to I want

00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,690
to I guess talk to you about my

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,080
experience in making my most recent game

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,660
trichrome on so try chroma is a simple

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,900
puzzle game where you slide the tiles

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,580
around you when you slide the tiles

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,040
around and you have three or more of the

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,470
same color that line up the tiles

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,420
disappear if you clear the board you

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,239
level up you get a new color it gets

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,269
hard up if the board feels up it's game

00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,280
over start again as you can see it's a

00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,970
very simple game it's completely written

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,760
in JavaScript HTML CSS and I use Cordova

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,440
to make it a native web app now I have

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,390
to give it a quick plug it is available

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,150
on the Google Play Store which is why

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,489
I'm standing here today not yet

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,940
available on iOS or Windows because I

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,830
didn't

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:22,450
time but I promise you it will be there

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:24,970
soon and I think trichrome I started as

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:28,810
many of you will have guessed with an

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:31,240
idea so the idea came from playing two

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,120
or four eight and three and also connect

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,580
four so one night after getting really

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,400
frustrated at 2048 because I can never

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:42,490
get that 2048 tile and so I thought what

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,410
have I change the rules slightly what if

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,900
instead of combining numbers i combined

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,760
colored tiles and like connect four when

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,310
enough of them are in a line something

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,560
magic happens and so this was an idea

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:57,790
and I went to sleep and unfortunately

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,290
many ideas and here right they stay in

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,210
your mind and you never get anywhere

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,390
with them they just sort of disappear

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,220
and collect us so the first step I think

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,100
that you need to do in order to get

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:12,280
somewhere is to do something with your

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,730
idea create a prototype have something

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,620
that you can play with in front of you

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,540
so with a prototype you want to spend as

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,360
little time as possible you want it to

00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,520
be quick and hockey you don't want to

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,850
make the code look pretty you just want

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,860
something working so the prototype for

00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:33,130
trachoma was a hacked up piece of

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,690
JavaScript done in a weekend and I can

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,120
promise you your code is going to be

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,910
horrible it's a prototype it should be

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,280
trachoma had global variables I had

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,960
hard-coded parameters there were bugs

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,330
but I could have fixed them because the

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,120
code was so fragile but that didn't

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,980
matter because a key thing for the

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,340
prototype is you want to validate two

00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,950
things firstly you want to validate that

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,220
your idea works and secondly you want to

00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,960
validate that it's technically possible

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,850
so in terms of idea you want to make

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:09,340
sure your idea actually has some legs as

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:13,120
harsh as it sounds many of our ideas are

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,190
actually pretty crap so you want to

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,530
create something quick and dirty that

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,490
you can prove that your idea actually

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,990
makes sense and on top of this once you

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,669
have something in front of you you can

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,710
give it to your friend or your flatmate

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,300
and they can play with it and tell you

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,180
if they think it makes sense

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,830
if they think it looks promising and if

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,389
it passes this test you know you've got

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,720
something that you can spend more time

00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:39,940
with the second thing is validating if

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,150
it's technically possible now of course

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,590
in this day and age it's very rare to

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,610
have something that is technically

00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:51,310
impossible right it's we can do almost

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,770
anything we want but the question is

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,539
more so can you finish this project by

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,599
yourself or maybe with a friend as

00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:01,419
you'll notice try chroma is very very

00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:03,610
simple it is very basically no graphics

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:06,039
in fact it's just a bunch of colored

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,639
rectangles and that is because I can't

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:11,860
draw to save my life I wanted to write a

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,530
game in which I can play to my strengths

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,259
one of which which is not drawing in

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,330
fact even the colors I had to get a

00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,919
friend to select the colors for me

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,039
because apparently my choices were

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,860
horrible so now that you've validated

00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,949
your idea is promising and you feel that

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,810
you can technically make this possible

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:36,340
you're on to your real adventure and

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:38,560
that is creating the real thing now when

00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,870
you're making the real thing two things

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,180
to keep in mind firstly you want to

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,889
throw away or your prototype code it is

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,960
horrible code that you do not want to

00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,969
build on top of because you want to

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,460
start with a fresh slate with no

00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,750
technical debt it may seem like a great

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,729
idea because you have something already

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,580
working but trust me in the long run

00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:59,710
you're going to hate yourself for it the

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,360
real purpose of your prototype was to

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,699
get a better understanding of your game

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,240
idea and not to give you code to start

00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:08,830
with the second thing with when you're

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,659
creating your real thing to keep in mind

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,699
is you want to build a Minimum Viable

00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:14,169
Product you don't want to build

00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,330
something that has all the bells and

00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:18,580
whistles you want to have something that

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,039
is just enough so that you can have it

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,219
up there published which means something

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,889
that is just enough that is functional

00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:31,029
reliable usable and has elements of

00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:33,070
design and thought put into it when

00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:35,440
you're building your MVP keep in mind

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,940
this is not what you want to do you

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,860
don't want to build the tiny bits and

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,390
pieces and eventually just try and piece

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:44,330
everything together because I go

00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,900
NTU some pieces will not work and things

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:49,730
are fall apart and you'll be in hell

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,160
instead you want to do something that

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:55,040
looks more like this you want to build

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,500
bits and pieces in such an iteration so

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,000
that you can test along the way the

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,030
first iteration might be something

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,070
really simple for example the tiles will

00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,380
move and you can check for combinations

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,930
but there's no detection for leveling up

00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,600
or game over the second iteration you

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,550
might actually check for game over third

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,220
iteration you check for level up and you

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,740
add that new tile color fourth iteration

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,680
you add score to it as you can see can

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,660
slowly build up your game so that along

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,830
each stage of the way you can do this

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,630
very important thing called play testing

00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,940
now play testing is something I highly

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:35,690
recommend you do as often as possible

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,670
and as early as possible the main reason

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,770
for this is as a developer you're going

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,860
to know your game inside out and you're

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,180
going to have a lot of assumptions and

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,300
play testing or challenge these

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,430
assumptions as frustrating as it is to

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,320
watch your friend sort of struggle

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:56,210
playing your game and missing the most

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,770
simplest and easiest rule it or all that

00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,540
means is you've made the incorrect

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:02,840
assumption that people understand how

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,940
your game works at the start of your

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,350
play testing you'll notice that you need

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,960
to make some rule changes some things

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:12,110
won't work or you'll get some feedback

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,540
which will enhance your game a lot if

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,220
you just tweak a rule a bit and towards

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,200
the end you'll find out what confuses

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,790
your users you'll realize that if you

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,430
add in a tutorial it'll make it so much

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:25,070
easier or if you change the way the

00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:28,070
scoring system works users will be able

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:30,830
to understand what it is so now on to

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,840
actually developing the game when you're

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:36,590
developing the game I highly suggest you

00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,600
do two things firstly do something such

00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,580
that you are learning something that

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,950
you'll find interesting and secondly

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,980
make a development process as painless

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,240
as possible so the reason I say you

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,880
should do something in which you're

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,710
learning is because at some point in

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,110
time no matter how excited you are about

00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,360
your

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,550
current idea you're going to get bored

00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,899
of it two weeks or two months down the

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,060
track you're going to have to implement

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,279
something that is extremely boring and

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,890
if you're not learning anything along

00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,300
this development process you're going to

00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,510
just put it away and it's going to be

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,980
shelved and it will disappear in terms

00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,459
of making on develop process less

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,290
painless I think that is quite simple

00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:17,730
you want to reduce as much friction as

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,269
possible because you want to make it as

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,740
easy as possible to develop your game

00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:26,190
there's already enough things going on

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,560
in the world and in your life to make it

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,899
harder for yourself which is something

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,760
you don't want to do and as this slide

00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,339
may have suggests you may have guessed

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,620
my suggestion for learning something and

00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:41,220
making it easier in my case was using

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,709
TDD or test-driven development so if you

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,730
haven't heard of test-driven test-driven

00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:49,500
development the idea is quite simple

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,050
instead of writing production code first

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,540
you have to stop and you don't write any

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:57,420
production code because the first thing

00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,519
you want to do is to write a test you

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,310
want to write a simple test to test a

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,760
tiny bit of functionality for example in

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:08,250
track promo the scoring system I wrote a

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,550
test that said there's a combination of

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:14,310
size length 3 on the first level you got

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,170
to give the user five points now I wrote

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,480
this test and obviously it failed

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,360
because I had nothing that gave me score

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,640
so the second thing I did was write a

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,320
bit of code to make this test pass and

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,089
you want to write the minimum amount of

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,910
code to write this test to make this

00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:32,640
test pass and that meant writing a

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,170
function that returned five you're

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,089
probably thinking that's a stupid

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,980
function it's not going to work but am

00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,290
ed test pass and that's the idea of

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,360
test-driven development write a small

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,490
test and the minimum amount of code to

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,380
make that test pass and then now the

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,709
important part is you repeat this

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,630
process I'll write another test this

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:54,839
time if you have a combination of size

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:57,449
for you return ten points and of course

00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,440
my damn implementation will have all

00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:02,579
failed this test so go back and i right

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,070
improved implementation a bit so it

00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,290
passes both tests

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,940
now you keep doing this refract this

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,100
loop and soon you will need to refactor

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,440
your code and this is why test-driven

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,350
development is often known as red green

00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,150
refactor and after a while you'll notice

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,270
you'll have clean code that is also

00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:23,360
functionally correct now this is great

00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:26,090
on a lot of levels mainly because

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,260
test-driven development encourages good

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:32,030
coding practice and good code in general

00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,580
the test forces you to think about the

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,710
code before you start writing which will

00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,230
mean you'll have better code less bugs

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:42,380
and more and just better code in general

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:44,360
and also the tests themselves were

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,640
ensure that you don't fall prey to

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,710
regression if any early test if you

00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,330
break anything the tests will go red and

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,820
you know you'll have to fix something up

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,880
so this is great with game development

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,740
because games have a lot of change in

00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,780
them and if you have a suite of tests

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,640
that will help back you up you have

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,370
confidence in continuing to write your

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,980
code and you won't sort of be wary to

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:09,050
change your code and you'll be able to

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,200
code more easily again making your

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,150
development process easier the other

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,980
great thing about games and test driven

00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,170
development which may seem like an

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,620
uncommon pair is they actually fit very

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:24,410
well together so the reason for this is

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,320
games have rules rules are

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,630
specifications and tet specifications

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,730
lend themselves extremely well to tests

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,490
in fact if you think of the jasmine

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,860
testing framework it gets you to write

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:39,560
specifications and not tests so as an

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,710
example try Kromah has a simple rule if

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,290
the grid is full then it's game over and

00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:49,610
as you can see this translates pretty

00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:51,500
much exactly to as jasmine test you

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,420
described that the grid should know when

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,720
it's full because this means you need to

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,640
do something about the game over state

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,530
another example you should grid should

00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,150
know when it's empty because this time

00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,940
you need to do something about leveling

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,760
up now you don't have to just restrict

00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:10,250
yourself to asserting the rules of the

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,910
game you can also assert things like the

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:16,040
behavior of the game for example the

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,940
grid should not allow you to add at all

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,400
to us

00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,680
this space that already has a tower it

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,040
should give you a huge warning because

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,960
if that happens something has gone wrong

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,300
so by the end of the TDD process you'll

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,340
have a suite of tests that lets gives

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:35,120
you confidence that your game engine is

00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:37,130
behaving the way you intended to and as

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,020
I alluded to earlier this is extremely

00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:41,540
important because your game is

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,220
definitely going to change all the play

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,620
testing that you are doing at the start

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,480
of your game you'll notice that you need

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,880
to make rule rule changes you need to

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,680
tweak the way that your games works so

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,580
that your system works in a nice balance

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:59,000
and this means refactoring your code now

00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,740
without the suite of tests refactoring

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,210
will be a daunting task because you're

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,980
not sure what you will break and not

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,290
show of your introduced regression bugs

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,330
and this creates friction and obstacle

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:10,520
to working on your game but with this

00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,340
suite of tests you will know that you

00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,350
can actually dive in change the code and

00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:19,010
as long as your test stayed green you

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:21,410
still have a working game if they may be

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,750
bugs in it but at least it is exactly

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:28,970
the same as you've left it before your

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:30,590
refactor the other benefit is this bead

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,470
back loop that you get from test-driven

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,390
development so especially at the start

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,340
of your game when you don't have any UI

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,460
and the only thing you have is the game

00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:43,370
engine and the logic this feedback loop

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:46,010
is is incredibly invaluable do not

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,720
underestimate the power of the red green

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,790
refactor loop when you're developing it

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,310
sort of like this incentive that helps

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:55,250
you murder motive helps motivate you to

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:58,100
keep going and this brings me to a small

00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:01,550
confession and that is i only tested the

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,130
game engine logic i did not test the UI

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:07,730
in fact i have zero tests for the UI

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:12,020
code and this is because i think UI

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:13,640
testing is extremely hard and as i

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,660
mentioned earlier you want to reduce

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:20,000
friction and there is a line between

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,720
setting up a lot of boilerplate code to

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,250
get your future development easy and

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,709
spending going down a rabbit hole and

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,039
try

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:31,230
get something working so as annoying as

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,090
it is to have to manually test you I I

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,460
think it was the right choice because if

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,429
I did go and try to set up all the crazy

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,130
you I staff one I would not be confident

00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:42,840
that tests everything and two I'm would

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,890
still probably be there trying to get it

00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:49,049
to setup and test everything so

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:52,020
therefore to test you I I simply worked

00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:54,149
in what I was most familiar with the

00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,360
chrome devtools now this is great

00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:59,059
because I had access to all the tools I

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,610
was used to the Dom inspector

00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:05,309
console.log the script tag to add break

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,710
points etc I was able to develop very

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,630
quickly as you will notice I've been

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,940
able to device mode on chrome developer

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,190
tools and that is because my main aim

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,980
for try chroma was to make it a mobile

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,960
web app a mobile app sorry I could have

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,240
made it a web app by adding in media

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,850
queries but I wanted it to be

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,419
installable and available for on the

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:30,659
Play Store and for this I needed to have

00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:34,020
some magic I wanted it to be as simple

00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:35,580
as possible to translate the JavaScript

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,789
that I'd written into a native

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,299
installable application and for this the

00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:43,470
magic came in the form of Apache Cordova

00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:45,990
so if you haven't heard of Apache

00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:48,029
Cordova it is effectively a platform for

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:51,870
building native web applications using

00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:54,960
javascript HTML and CSS so Apache

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,330
Cordova provides you with a set of AP is

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,909
that allows you to access the native

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,370
functionality from JavaScript and the

00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:06,179
great thing was Cordova was extremely

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:08,340
easy to use do you simply create a

00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:11,520
Cordova project by running the Cordova

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,000
create command and it will create a file

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,029
structure that looks something like this

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,279
our Cordova provides support to many

00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:22,500
many platforms including Android iOS

00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:25,830
Windows blackberry and I don't believe

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,120
Firefox OS as well but for the rest of

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,200
this talk I'm going to mainly

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,289
concentrate on the Android platform

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,760
because i only own an Android device so

00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:35,160
I couldn't really test on the other

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,400
at forms but all the other platforms are

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,140
pretty much the same for example to add

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,420
the Android platform you run this

00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,410
command you've got to run the iOS

00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:48,540
platform you change android/ios when you

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,850
do run this command what Cordova does is

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,490
it modifies this directory structure

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,980
that you've got here and adds in the

00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,290
Android directory under your platforms

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,150
and if you open the Android directory

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,930
you'll see all the familiar Android

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,580
application folders folders and files

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:08,250
that you would see in a native android

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,590
game or app so you have the

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:14,070
androidmanifest.xml you've got the

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,780
assets for your images libs resources

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,060
and resources directory for your java

00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,600
classes but because we're writing a

00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,860
Cordova app in JavaScript HTML CSS

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,830
you're actually not going to touch any

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:28,950
of this in fact in order to modify the

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,330
behavior of your application you're

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,420
generally going to be modifying the

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:35,610
config.xml file so the config.xml file

00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,740
looks something like this looks a bit

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,320
scary because it's all just XML but it's

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,780
actually really simple and really

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,820
powerful so for example you want your

00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,210
game to run in full screen you just set

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,190
the preference or full screen to true or

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,620
you maybe you want the game to run

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,960
always important so when the user flips

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:59,100
the mobile device it won't change the

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,810
orientation yet another line so Cordova

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,720
will translate these directly to the

00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:05,880
native code for you you can also specify

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,860
the application name and this is what

00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,990
appears under the icon that is on the

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:13,020
home screen and of course you can

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:15,200
specify the application icon itself so

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,850
as you can see the confidant XML in

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,380
Cordova is extremely powerful it makes

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:22,380
it a life easier when you want to

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,470
translate your web app game into the

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,750
native game into a native app and of

00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,360
course this is just the behavior if you

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,910
want to add functionality you can use

00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,380
the Cordova plugins now the Cordova

00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,660
plugins allowed to access native

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:40,080
functionality like the camera or in-app

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:42,660
purchases gps accelerometer etc allowing

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,580
you to make a very powerful game or

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:49,150
application the great news

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:52,180
is most of these plugins are open source

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,740
which means if it doesn't do quite what

00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,740
you want you can contribute back to

00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,390
their plug-in and enhance it or if a

00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,270
plugin does not exist you're free to

00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:03,250
create your own using Cordova plugins

00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,800
are almost just as easy as creating

00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,350
Cordova project itself simply find the

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,730
plug-in key you want you add the plug-in

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:14,080
and then you can start using it now

00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:16,120
since I wanted to create it as a native

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,720
app obviously I needed to create and

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,630
build the install APK file and again

00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,400
Cordova makes it really easy by just

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:28,330
running the court over build command and

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:33,010
to run it on your device as expected

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:35,350
Cordova run so what this does is Cordova

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:39,580
has basically meant that with very

00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:45,100
minimal amount of work i can go from the

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:47,380
Chrome browser into a mobile phone now

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,990
it is probably at this moment that

00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,240
you'll notice the app on your mobile

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:55,780
will not look like the app on your

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,070
Chrome browser because the browsers on

00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,710
your phone and on a device are

00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,780
completely different and as we as front

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,580
end is all no different browsers mean

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,680
different CSS quirks and possibly

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,420
different JavaScript quirks so right now

00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,760
you probably want to right click on your

00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,980
phone to try and change something and to

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,360
inspect the element but unfortunately

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,730
you can't right click on your phone

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,010
which means you can't debug but the good

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,770
news is you can do remote debugging and

00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,500
it is extremely easy all you need to do

00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,810
is connect your phone to your laptop

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,150
fire up your app and then fire up chrome

00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,880
on your laptop and go to the Chrome

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:35,830
inspect tab and then select the app as

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:38,740
the window you want to debug and you'll

00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:41,770
see something like this as you can see

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:44,110
there's the chrome web tools inside on

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,940
your laptop and as you hover over the

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,680
diamond elements it will hover over the

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,290
corresponding elements on your phone

00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,690
itself now this is really cool because

00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:55,750
you can do everything you're used to you

00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:57,639
can modify delete add Dom elements and

00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,249
they will be reflected on your phone

00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:02,259
I you can change the CSS as well set

00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:04,539
breakpoints look at console.log

00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:06,309
basically everything you're used to and

00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:08,529
this is an invaluable tool when you're

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:11,169
debugging and making sure that your app

00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:13,149
looks correct on the phone so this

00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:15,489
brings me to the very key point and that

00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:18,039
is you definitely want to do device

00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:20,349
testing you want to remember to test on

00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,759
a variety of devices in particular for

00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:24,659
Android because there are different

00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:27,879
screen sizes different performance

00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:31,029
different performance levels on each on

00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:32,979
each phone and this is because Cordova

00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:35,409
uses the webview so you want to make

00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:37,989
sure that despite the differences

00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:40,209
between your operating systems and your

00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:42,899
browser's it will look that and behave

00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:46,029
the same and one more thing and that is

00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:48,159
when you're swiping on the phone it is

00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:50,679
actually very different to using a key

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,139
to using the keyboard on your computer

00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:55,779
so you definitely want to do device

00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:59,859
testing it's almost as important as play

00:24:55,779 --> 00:25:01,389
testing so there's one small gotcha that

00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:04,479
I have to mention and that is with the

00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:06,309
Cordova docks so the Cordova docks are

00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:08,259
pretty good they're a bit of a hit and

00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:11,589
miss at times but in general they get

00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:12,820
you to where you want the gotcha is you

00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:16,029
want to make sure you're looking at the

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:18,969
right version of the docks so I was

00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:21,700
using Cordova 3.6 and every so often I

00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:23,379
would Google a problem that I had click

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,619
on the first link that google gave me

00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:28,479
and be completely confused and that was

00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:31,359
because i was looking at an older

00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:33,099
version of the Cordova doc so it'll be

00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,499
confusing because it's talking about the

00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:37,329
right thing but in a different way so

00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:39,070
when you're using these docs make sure

00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:41,919
you're using the right version and can

00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,419
see that in the top right drop down this

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,769
will save you hours and hours of

00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:50,589
confusion now as with all things we know

00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:52,599
that development process is not all fun

00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:54,940
and games you're going to have problems

00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:56,229
and obstacles along the way you have

00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,559
technical problems that you need to

00:25:56,229 --> 00:26:01,269
solve and life may also get in hilly way

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,279
so in regards to technical problems I

00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:06,279
definitely hit one as I was developing

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,159
trichrome on to the first and I guess

00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:13,239
the biggest one that I hit was this

00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:16,570
seeing here if you look at this you may

00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:18,429
think that it's great index CSS image

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,679
JavaScript I can just open this this

00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:23,649
should be a web app and you can develop

00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,649
on your browser unfortunately this is

00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:29,229
not the case and this is because if you

00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:31,029
try and open the index.html here you're

00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:32,559
going to get a javascript error it's

00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:35,349
going to say something along the lines

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,629
of Cordova is not found and this is

00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:40,269
because Cordoba jayus is a platform

00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:42,099
specific file and it is generated by the

00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,649
Cordoba build command and placed into

00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:46,989
the platforms directory and its really

00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:50,349
only accessible when you load it on your

00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:53,139
phone that the index.html points to the

00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:54,789
correct Cordova j/s file now of course

00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:57,309
when you hit problems you don't just

00:26:54,789 --> 00:27:00,519
give up you want to find a solution for

00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:03,039
it so my solution was I wanted to still

00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,499
develop in chrome because I'd wanted to

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,659
make my dev psychol as easy as possible

00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:09,999
I did not want to deploy on to a phone

00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:12,220
every time I wanted to test that would

00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:14,919
be too much friction and I feel like I

00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:18,279
would give up very quickly so my

00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:21,159
solution was quite simple here is your

00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,599
Cordova app and I wanted to not work in

00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,539
the cord / app and work in the web

00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:29,799
browser so effectively ignore the cord /

00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:33,249
app create and put it under sort of a

00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:35,799
top level directory and create my web

00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:38,019
app files that I've used to index CSS

00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:40,809
image and JavaScript outside of the

00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:43,720
Cordova wrap so now I basically just

00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:47,769
modify and edit using these three four

00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,080
sorry these four directories and files

00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:53,830
and I could open this in chrome and

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,659
develop as I'm used to and the trick

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:58,570
here is when I wanted to test them a

00:27:55,659 --> 00:28:02,109
device I would copy and paste those

00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:04,570
files into the corner of our WWE now

00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:08,139
this worked great the first time because

00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:10,450
as developers I think we are all a bit

00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:12,429
lazy and copying and pasting files into

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,710
directories isn't something that we want

00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:16,509
to do time is already very precious

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,149
finding the few hours after work to

00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:21,279
develop on your side project and hobby

00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:22,269
and game is already hard so you don't

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,129
know waste these hours

00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:26,229
copy and pasting files and it's also

00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:28,869
very error-prone so this is where

00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:32,379
automation comes in and in JavaScript

00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:34,179
automation is effectively grant so grant

00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:37,059
if you haven't heard of it is awesome

00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:40,089
it's a JavaScript a strong arm and it

00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:42,969
lets you specify a config file and then

00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:45,759
once you've done the specification you

00:28:42,969 --> 00:28:48,330
only need to run grunt and run a command

00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:51,279
and it'll do this automatically for you

00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:54,359
so I used grunts to automate this copy

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:57,669
pasting by specifying a few

00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:59,799
configurations for my CSS and JavaScript

00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:02,320
so for my CSS this is what my

00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:05,729
configuration looks like i use the sass

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,649
plug-in created a Cordova task and

00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:12,179
effectively as you can see in my main

00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:15,219
dot FCSS on my top level CSS directory

00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:17,769
when I got caught the grunt plugin to

00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:20,469
compile the file I got it to compile it

00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:22,829
into the main dot into main dot CSS but

00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:26,109
under the Cordova directory effectively

00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:28,419
copying it into the correct place where

00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:30,489
I needed it and the great thing about

00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:32,829
ground is it lets user so specify other

00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:35,739
options such as I want the style to be

00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:38,739
compressed to save space did a similar

00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:42,190
thing to JavaScript using the uglify

00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:43,959
plugin created a Cordova task and just

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:48,459
said anything under JavaScript or

00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:51,099
library copy it into the Cordova classes

00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:54,639
and bundled these both of these tasks

00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:56,469
into one parent household pulled over so

00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:59,139
now during my development process all I

00:29:56,469 --> 00:30:02,889
needed to do was to run grunt cordova

00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:05,019
and edward compile and minify my CSS and

00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:08,079
my JavaScript and place it into the

00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:11,079
Cordova directory ready for me to build

00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,849
and run it on my device so this might

00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:14,709
sound like a lot of things but the key

00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:18,249
point here is you want to simplify a

00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:20,200
development process as possible the

00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:22,839
problems you meet might be different the

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,369
problems I've met but the key thing to

00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:27,009
remember is you want to make it as easy

00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:28,389
as possible for you so you don't have to

00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:30,129
worry about all the peripheral things

00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:33,579
what you want to worry about is creating

00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:35,559
your game and making it work there's

00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:38,169
frankly speaking there is not enough

00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:40,470
in a day to remember boring things such

00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:43,929
as commands and copy and pasting files

00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:46,210
now as frustrating as it is for me I

00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:49,179
have some good news for you and that is

00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:51,909
if you're going to create a native web

00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:53,499
app of Cordova you don't need to do

00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:55,720
anything of what I just explained

00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:58,659
because in Cordova for or they fix this

00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,120
they fix this by adding the browser as a

00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:03,759
platform so remember how I mentioned you

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,029
couldn't open the index.html because

00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,980
Cordova jayus was a compiled version a

00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:11,799
compiled file specific to the platform

00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,779
well now the browser is at platform so

00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:16,090
you can add it and when you want to do

00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:18,450
any testing you can run it and then you

00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:21,759
would have the browser as a platform

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,409
once more word of warning is that the

00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,259
browser platform is still in the initial

00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:27,879
stages so there are a few bugs but in

00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,850
general I give it a quick run and it

00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:32,889
looks like it works relatively well so

00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,379
if you are at this stage of the

00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:37,840
development where your periodically

00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:40,149
testing on the phone and you're checking

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,369
and fixing up a few things it is time

00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:44,320
for celebration because you've made it a

00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:47,619
long way you've made it further than a

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,330
lot of people your idea has actually

00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:52,659
grown some legs and it's getting

00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:55,029
somewhere the problem though is the

00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:58,029
finishing line and this is the hardest

00:31:55,029 --> 00:32:00,490
part of all developing the game itself

00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:03,460
is challenging you're going to face many

00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,649
technical challenges but it is probably

00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,509
equally challenging to make that last

00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:10,299
twenty percent and cross the finishing

00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:12,249
line so I'm going to give you five tips

00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:16,269
many of which I have alluded to already

00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:18,700
during this talk so the first thing is

00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:20,409
make sure when you're developing you're

00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,509
always learning something during the

00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:24,490
development process because otherwise

00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:27,909
you're going to get bored really quickly

00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:30,340
and the game will disappear and be

00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:33,220
shelved now keep in mind and I think

00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:36,039
this is something as developers we make

00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,869
a mistake very often and that is the

00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,389
learning does not stop when the

00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:44,379
development stops you can keep learning

00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:47,289
even after developing so the act of

00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,600
publishing your game is learning the act

00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:49,160
of

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,140
getting your game out into the world is

00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,730
learning getting feedback from some one

00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:56,500
halfway across the world because they

00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:59,390
don't understand English is learning so

00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,870
if you want to learn stuff that's more

00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:05,090
than just development publish your game

00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:07,490
second tip is friends are amazing

00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,860
they're great for being the first play

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:12,020
testers you can continuously nag them

00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,120
for feedback they'll get annoyed but you

00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,490
can still keep nagging them and of

00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,960
course they're there to push to help you

00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,000
and to encourage you there there as

00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,010
moral support there's going to be times

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,600
and you just don't want to work on the

00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,460
game and they'll be there to give you

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,890
that small nudge that you need to just

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:31,130
cross the finishing line on a more

00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:33,260
technical level scope scope is something

00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:36,770
that is a pitfall for many projects both

00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,809
personal and I guess work-related scope

00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:42,380
creep you've probably all heard about it

00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:44,419
is horrible and this is a chance as the

00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,350
owner of your own game or project to

00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:49,490
limit the scope as much as you can

00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,110
especially when you're playtesting and

00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,640
you get all this awesome feedback you're

00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,260
going to want to add and change things

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,559
but you want to be careful going to be

00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:02,539
strict and remember to work on the

00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:05,080
Minimum Viable Product you want to if it

00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:07,520
doesn't add value to the game drop it

00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,649
remember even after you've you released

00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,780
your game you can still add things to it

00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:13,629
you're creating a piece of software

00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,980
you're not creating a building after

00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:19,669
version 1 point 0 you can release

00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:22,250
version 11 and it'll be okay people will

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:24,440
be happy with it and something to help

00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:27,320
us cope is to set yourself a deadline

00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,810
hard deadlines work best so for example

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,310
the deadline for trachoma was this talk

00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,590
and this is why I'm standing here now

00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,450
because I had to get it published but if

00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,450
you don't have a hard deadline set

00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:40,760
yourself a soft deadlines a deadline is

00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:43,700
better than none so if you set yourself

00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,750
a dot soft deadline make sure you get

00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:49,250
your friends to hold yourself

00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:50,510
accountable for it maybe set yourself a

00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,540
punishment if you don't make yourself

00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:56,960
deadline and finally last but not least

00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:59,750
is to start just start on creating the

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,870
game start on the prototype get your

00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,420
idea out of your head

00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,130
it into the computer start on fixing

00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,230
that bug that has been annoying you for

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,660
the past week start on adding that small

00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:12,090
little feature that will enhance your

00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:15,870
game a lot i find that starting is

00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:18,000
almost just as hard as finishing if so

00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:21,120
as clichéd as it may sound i think if

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,660
you start you're halfway there so

00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,640
hopefully many of you who have had ideas

00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:30,000
either started or still just in your

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,760
head will now be a bit more motivated to

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,630
go forth and complete start on your idea

00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,970
and see it through to completion so just

00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:41,430
one more thing this one final thing

00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,320
isn't exactly critical to helping you

00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,060
complete your game but I think it's

00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,490
something that is extremely nice to have

00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,040
and that is to give credit to the people

00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:54,540
that actually help you make your game

00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,880
possible so in this line I know they're

00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:59,520
not here but I'd like to say thanks to

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,930
my great friends Deborah grace and LeAnn

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,760
because they were incredibly supportive

00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:05,160
and they definitely played a role in

00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,120
helping me finish the game trichrome arm

00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,830
and also in terms of the slides I

00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:15,690
grabbed art from these people who shared

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:18,090
their awesome artwork and icons and the

00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:21,390
MVP image which was actually based off a

00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,790
Spotify talk so that is the end of my

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,730
talk and I hope that you guys have now

00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:29,070
been inspired and had the tools to start

00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:33,080
on your game and finish it thank you

00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:33,080
very much thank you thank you

00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:40,090
and so we hope that next time when you

00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,130
ask how many of you have done it more

00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,410
hands will be raised thanks for sharing

00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,119
your journey because when you do it very

00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,940
recently and share it immediately have

00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:52,300
so many things to reflect on a couple of

00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:55,270
questions for Peggy especially those of

00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:59,800
you who have been thinking about coding

00:36:55,270 --> 00:37:12,160
a game and not been able to do so any

00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:14,740
questions over there I run oh yes i did

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,119
i'd be interested to know if you had any

00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:21,790
issues with performance on mobile using

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,760
just the responsiveness of the UI or

00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:27,730
anything like that and how you dealt

00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,230
with it okay um so for track promo i was

00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:31,780
lucky in that it was a very simple game

00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:33,490
there was there's no actual animation

00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,310
except for when you slide the tiles

00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:40,180
which is maybe like once every five

00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:41,980
seconds i looked into it a bit and

00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,810
initially I was using CSS animations

00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,380
which I thought was more performant on

00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:49,810
mobile if you enable the 3d sort of

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,510
translate but Indiana actually went with

00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:54,880
velocity jas because despite using

00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,710
jQuery it actually optimizes it and now

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,350
mobile browsers are actually quite

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:01,840
powerful to handle JavaScript animations

00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:06,940
and velocity jas does give you more

00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:10,810
flexibility with CSS yep all right it

00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:17,740
and maybe just one more i'll get the mic

00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:20,380
to you what's the feedback been like and

00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:23,910
it has that affected the development of

00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:26,200
the game going forward sir the feedback

00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:28,420
so the game has only been released for

00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,400
about two or three weeks and one of the

00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,320
things that I still am learning to do is

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,930
how to market it better so I haven't

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,700
actually had a great deal of uptake on

00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,550
it but in terms of feedback from

00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,490
playtesting to improve the game during

00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:44,470
my development process the first

00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,619
iteration for the prototype was actually

00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,170
quite different from

00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:50,940
the final version and that was because

00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:53,609
most of my friends said that they needed

00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,160
a goal for the game and that is where I

00:38:53,609 --> 00:39:00,180
basically changed the entire rules in

00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,680
order to I guess improve the game i'm

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,779
hoping i won't received that type of

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,710
feedback from the general public because

00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:09,089
i find that trachoma is already quite

00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:12,599
well polished in a way it could be

00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:17,309
biased that i think in general you just

00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:20,039
have to take feedback as it comes great

00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:23,990
Thank You Peggy thank you for your

00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:23,990
