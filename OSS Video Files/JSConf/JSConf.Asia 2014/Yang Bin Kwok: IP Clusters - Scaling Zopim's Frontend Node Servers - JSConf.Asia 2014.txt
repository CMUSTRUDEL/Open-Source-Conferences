Title: Yang Bin Kwok: IP Clusters - Scaling Zopim's Frontend Node Servers - JSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2014-12-17
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	Realtime applications are easy with Node, but how do you scale out when the load hits? Zopim shares the lessons learnt at scale, as well as their approach to enterprise class software of a simplified network topology eschewing dedicated load balancers and firewalls.

Yang Bin is a co-founder of Zopim and currently works on simplifying the distribution of realtime data across their POPs and the frontend. One day, he hopes to open source Zopimâ€™s web application framework, but in the meantime he dabbles in image processing, visualizations and chinchillas.

JSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 20 + 21 November 2014.
