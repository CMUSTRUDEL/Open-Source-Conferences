Title: Feross Aboukhadijeh: WebTorrent - JSConf.Asia 2014
Publication date: 2014-12-14
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2014
Description: 
	This talk will look at WebTorrent, a BitTorrent client for the browser that fully-interoperates with the regular BitTorrent network. WebTorrent uses WebRTC Data Channels and special "hybrid clients" to connect to the wider BitTorrent network. It’s insane to try this.

Feross is currently building WebTorrent, a streaming BitTorrent client for the browser, powered by WebRTC. Before that, he built PeerCDN, a peer-to-peer content delivery network to makes sites faster and cheaper.
He’s a graduate of Stanford and has worked at Quora, Facebook, and Intel and loves "mad science" projects!

JSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 20 + 21 November 2014.
