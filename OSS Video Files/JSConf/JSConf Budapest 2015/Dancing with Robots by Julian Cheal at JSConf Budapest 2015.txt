Web apps are great and everything, but imagine using JS to fly drones and make them dance to the sounds of dubstep! Or to control disco lights and other robots! Sounds fun, right? In this talk, we will not only explore how we can write code to make this possible, but it will also be full of exciting, interactive (and possibly dangerous ;) ) demos!

hey

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,080
thanks oh that's loud hi um yes so i'm

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,199
julian chill

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,359
and um i quite like robots and

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,680
uh so we're just gonna have a little

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,640
play and see what kind of crazy things

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,240
we can do

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,400
with javascript and robotics so um

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,439
to do that uh we're just going to use

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,880
two two live

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,280
libraries one is cylon js and

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,399
uh the other one is johnny five which

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,920
has got such a cool

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,239
logo um so as everyone knows that

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
uh javascript is now taking over the

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,200
world and is going to be run on

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,280
absolutely everything

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,640
and so why not you know you have it on

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,360
servers you have it on phone so why not

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,559
have it on

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,480
bits of hardware so let's just have a

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,680
quick look see how easy

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,199
that is so um when you uh write your

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,879
first program you normally do

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,680
a hello world so in javascript you'd

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,119
sort of do uh console.log you know hello

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,119
world and and then you'd be like yeah

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,520
i'm a javascript developer and um so

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,320
with with um with with hardware the

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,680
equivalent of

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,320
of hello world is is the blink um

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,600
app so so this is uh cylon as you can

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,799
see it's only 17

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,720
uh lines of code and so we start off

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,400
creating an adapter to an arduino using

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,600
the femata protocol and fermata is a

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,759
really interesting protocol

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,880
it's based on midi which if any of you

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,680
were born in the 80s

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,200
you'll probably know what midi is and it

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,200
basically turns every pin

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
on the device into an api so you can

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,439
turn them on and off which is really

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,000
cool because then we can uh

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,000
script it with code so we create a

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,880
connection to an arduino we

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
set an led to be on pin 13 and then

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,040
every second we

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,719
toggle it on and off so if i just come

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,680
over here

00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,680
plug this in

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,959
oh there's on the screen great so i just

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,520
oops don't add more code i'll just run

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,080
the code for this so what i'm doing

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:23,200
quickly

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:24,879
is just making sure it's all plugged in

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,080
it's plugged in somewhere but it's not

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,080
appearing on here no

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:40,080
okay let's just try it anyway uh node

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,319
no it's not connected demos died already

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,120
let's start that again

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,680
right so it's getting power what's going

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,480
on

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,239
let's follow the cables right let's just

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,160
move this

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:58,080
right um so that goes into

00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:05,120
there which goes into

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:06,560
that one which goes hmm

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
you can't oh there we go it's come up

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,200
right so and i've just got a a

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,640
command line app that tells me the

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
device id

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,040
um because unfortunately when i'm using

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,040
the usb hub and changing between

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,280
demos it they keep changing id so i've

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,560
just set that there so if i

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,560
now run this code

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,840
yay that's now

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,840
blinking there we go yay hello world of

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
robots

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,920
wow that was complicated so you think

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,640
okay 17 lines of code i can turn an led

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,560
on what

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,720
use is that but you'll notice there's so

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560
many like exit signs

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,080
and like old mobile phones used to have

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,120
a blinking light so we basically

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,720
can now write 90 of all hardware jobs

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
that you'll ever need so we can turn an

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,280
led off so yes

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,280
excellent right so let's quit that so

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,400
um some reason that the led stays turned

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,720
on afterwards so

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,599
um we can turn on one led and that's

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,519
really cool

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,680
um can we just um shift back to the code

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,680
oh that was quick right so now we can

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,159
turn on one led what happens if we turn

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
on

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,799
three leds so same code again we're

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,840
going to turn on a red pin a green pin

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,120
and a blue pin

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,440
or rgb so if i just

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,440
um connect up the ground

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,919
can we see that yay right so if i run

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,840
this code so it's exactly the same code

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,840
i just instead of one led

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,840
we're talking to three of them

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,199
yay we've got rgb values coming from an

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,960
led

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,400
so now we can color the world and make

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,960
it all beautiful

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,840
which is amazing let me just see your

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,919
microphone

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,000
so um we can turn on one led we can turn

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,080
on three leds and make color

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,919
a silly microphone right um can we go

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,919
back to the code

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,280
so that's cool so that was running on an

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,320
arduino and

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,479
if you wanted to run it oh hang on

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,600
it's gonna get complicated so if you

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,199
wanted to run it on

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,400
a beaglebone black um it's exactly the

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,560
same code

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,320
no just move down to there you just

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
change the adapter to beaglebone black

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,720
and if you wanted to run it on a spark

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
core

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
which i think they've just now renamed

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,880
themselves to photon or

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,160
electricity or something so all my

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,639
code's now wrong but

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,600
it's exactly the same code again you

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,360
just need to change the device driver

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,120
and could i have the camera

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,880
i don't know if you can see this so this

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,680
is a digispark

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
um tiny little usb kind of arduino

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160
compatible thing

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
just with a little led on there and you

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,520
think why would i put an led on

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,720
something so small like this but imagine

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
if you just had this connected to your

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,199
computer

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,880
you could uh if you had a green led in

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,160
here as well you could toggle between

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,199
green and red depending on whether your

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,280
ci server

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,960
is working or broken which i think is

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,000
kind of cool and so

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,000
they're fun too right

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,960
so so we've turned on um let's do this

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,400
so we've turned on one led we turned on

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,800
multiple leds

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,800
but wouldn't it be cool if we could turn

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,800
on like loads of leds

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,400
so what you'd think wow that must be

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,560
really complicated

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,560
but it turns out all you need to know is

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
how to turn on one led and how to use an

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,759
array

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:35,840
and then bob's your uncle tada

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:35,840
rgb led strips

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,880
let's just leave that there simples how

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,880
pretty is that

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,199
let's have a look so leave that oh code

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,639
excellent right

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,639
so what have we done we've done

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,479
arduino's digisparks has ah

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,680
yes exciting right so um all those demos

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,039
were running for mata

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,880
on the devices and then i was

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,080
controlling them uh

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,360
from my machine but obviously when

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
you're going to deploy all of this in

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,240
the field you're not going to deploy a

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,680
macbook pro with an arduino

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,960
that would be really expensive actually

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,759
it's macbook air that'd be really

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,960
expensive

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,880
so that's why you

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,400
get something like this

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,840
can we sit which is a tesl

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,560
so i don't know how many of you have

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,680
ever seen a tesl it basically

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,199
uh runs uh javascript on the board

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,840
they say it run javascript on the board

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,680
actually converts it to lua but

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,639
effectively it runs javascript on the

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,680
board

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,520
so if i just plug this into my image

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:44,319
open i should do occasionally if i just

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:47,840
plug this in

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,840
can we just go to the screen quickly

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,199
so um all you need to do up there in my

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,240
terminal is just run the tesl library

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,599
and we're just going to run the basic

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,199
program blink

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:04,479
which should find the

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,639
tesla at the top connected to tesltm

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,400
it's let's just scroll up it's

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,840
converting our javascript to lua

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,759
and as you can see it says it's blinking

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,039
lots of times and if we move over here

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,199
to the camera

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,240
yay so that's actually running

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,879
javascript now

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,240
to blink these leds which if i was to

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,280
unplug this from my laptop and just plug

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,759
it into the main somewhere

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,879
i've now got an internet of things led

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,199
that i can deploy

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,039
all over the world which i think is

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
pretty cool

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,599
because it's all written in javascript

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,039
so that's great yay

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,880
cool um oh yeah

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,399
that was the thing so i haven't wired

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,719
this up but

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,839
so we've got rgb led strips we've got

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,680
single leds

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
uh wouldn't it be cool if you look like

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,480
a character from tron

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,080
so um this stuff is called el wire and

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,959
you basically put a voltage through it

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
and it lights up

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,920
so it's just connected to a battery pack

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,720
at the moment but imagine if you had it

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,040
connected

00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,760
to a switch so it would pulse on and off

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,680
say

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,360
to some dubstep that would be pretty

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,959
cool and so

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,360
you and all your friends can now look

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,320
like tron let's just leave that there

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,360
that's

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,720
quite pretty and that's really really

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,160
simple

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,680
okay where are we going now ah yes

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,920
um so it's not just leds

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,600
you can do with this internet of of

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,440
things

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:32,480
you can also control real world devices

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:37,839
so there are so many cables

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,839
let's have a look

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,920
yes so um this here

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,600
is a um guitar effects pedal of mine

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,040
which i've soldered and wired into the

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,279
breadboard and connected it

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,640
to an arduino so that when um

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,800
i press the button it will play uh

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,800
party records on on spotify

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,680
unfortunately couldn't get the the wi-fi

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,560
working

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,760
but um so we we're not able to enjoy

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
party rockers but

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
the the idea is with that is you just

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,480
stamp on the pedal

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,120
and then music comes lights turn on

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,480
all controlled by javascript and as you

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,680
can see it's the same

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,399
kind of code we just um connected to an

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,399
arduino with

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,760
mata instead of the led driver we're

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,480
using the button

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,519
and um when the button's been released

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,720
or you can even do it when it's being

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,440
pressed so you can actually get two

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,040
commands

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,360
out of the button you can just do

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,959
different things

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,200
so i think that's that's kind of neat so

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,240
we can we can test the code to see

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,240
if that works

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,560
starting the connection so it should

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,560
hopefully if i press this

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,680
yay you can see so there's oh coming

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,399
back to the screen there's a bit of

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,640
noise

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,160
on the cable so it thinks it's been

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,720
pressed lots of times

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,240
and now it's gone and started up spotify

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,079
which is going to crash

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,760
oops but yes if if i had internet that

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,120
would we would have been party rocking

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,320
there so just imagine it in your minds

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,360
right so

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,720
um oh yeah so uh those are all

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,760
all really really fun things um

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,399
so uh has anyone seen

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,720
this it you may recognize it from a new

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,079
star wars film this is the older cousin

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,279
of the little robot that rolls around um

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,440
it's called a sphero so to use it you've

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,560
got to wake it up

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,079
by shaking it violently and

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,279
it should appear in my bluetooth along

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,279
with everybody else's phones

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,600
there it is so i just paired to this

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,720
while that's

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,240
pairing there's my library on the

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,399
on the mac it's really useless because

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,320
uh os 10 wants to manage bluetooth for

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,920
you but on linux you can automate

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,600
all of the bluetooth connections which

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,200
is really nice so that says it's

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,800
connected so if i run

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,800
my node app oh that's good

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,800
let's go to chrome so um basically the

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
the the sphero is has got motors so it

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,000
can roll around

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,600
uh on the floor and you know dogs and

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,320
cats love chasing it

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,920
uh and it's also got um leds in it as

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,079
you can see i quite like leds

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,279
so what i've done here i've taken a demo

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,000
from leah verou

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,040
where you can dynamically change the the

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,519
color on the screen

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,040
using all of the valid css colors and it

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,320
should change the color

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,880
of the sphero so if we change it from

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,440
this nice

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:46,399
pink to lime hopefully

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:49,440
the demo gods are with us no

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:54,720
why are you no change

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:58,480
oh well it should have changed color

00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:07,519
oh well so you can imagine

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:09,519
that it's now red

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,440
oh well but the the the code for that is

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,079
is really nice and simple where's my

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,079
sphero gone

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,519
so all i did for that was um

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,639
require cylon again uh this time i'm

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,600
actually using

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,880
some web b framework so express and and

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,079
socket io

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:33,360
and then basically the web page sends

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:36,399
a integer via socket io and then the

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,199
cylon grabs that and then sets the color

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,000
sets the color of the zero to be to be

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,279
that color

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,680
which is uh kind of cool if it works so

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,079
i don't know why it didn't there we go

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,519
so that was that that was fun

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,800
right let's do some audio things now

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,279
that's that's always fun

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,279
so um let me just plug this in

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,160
has anyone ever played with or seen a

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,920
leap motion i don't know why it's

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,639
looking up there it's here

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,040
a leap motion it's basically an array of

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,560
um

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,120
sensors that is meant to add um

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,199
you know gesture control to your to your

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,320
computer so if we just run the

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:21,120
demo app here

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,120
is that going to load

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,079
huh

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,839
why is that not loading let's just

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,839
unplug that and try again

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,800
i wish you were all in the back room

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,440
with me earlier when all of this worked

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,440
perfectly

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,360
hmm okay the the sphero demo uh that's

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,600
so the leap motion demo

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,560
doesn't seem it's their app anyways

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,160
rubbish right

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,160
um but uh oh where's the codes gone

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,760
so i was thinking you know you can you

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,560
can use this you can swipe between web

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,720
pages

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,480
and you know do all that kind of thing i

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,399
thought that's not very exciting

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,920
wouldn't it be more exciting if you

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,440
could make karaoke

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,839
with a leap motion so if i

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,839
find the i think i can just run that

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,639
here so let's see

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,639
node harder

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,880
right so the idea of this is um

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,240
it starts harder faster stronger by daft

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,000
punk

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,760
and then

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,800
[Music]

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,160
using my amazing javascript skills i

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,519
basically loop this

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:38,240
array and on key tap i will play the

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,240
the audio tracks do the voiceover so

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
ready

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,830
[Music]

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:55,839
i mean it's not perfect

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,079
imagine having two of them that would be

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,480
really cool for those of you that are

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,600
shy

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:08,560
at karaoke after after a conference you

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,560
can just wave your hands about

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,880
that's kind of fun and the the code for

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,880
that is just yeah as you can see

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,800
same kind of thing create elite motion

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,360
device and connection

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,079
some nasty javascript and then on key

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,199
tap

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,720
run the the song the the keynote amongst

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,440
you will notice that i'm actually

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
uh forking af play so i've actually got

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,440
no way

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,839
of stopping the music on this demo

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,839
except for kill or af

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
play

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,440
but you know that it's not enterprise so

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,440
it's fine

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,920
okay right this is where it gets

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,160
exciting

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:59,279
ish if it all works okay um

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,320
so it's not just lights and leds

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,959
and whatnot that you can turn on

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,000
you can also use i should forget it's

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,280
over there

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,160
um uh playstation controllers and xbox

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,880
controllers

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,720
and for the four or four others in the

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,039
world of you that bought an uyer

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:22,240
uh you can use the ouya controller

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,679
so if i just um

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,959
pair this to the computer playstation

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,880
controller connected

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:34,880
excellent so then come over here

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,240
and so over here i have a parrot ar

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,960
drone i don't know if any of you have

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,720
ever

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,720
played with one or seen one before

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,400
it's basically a flight oh there it is

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,320
oh it's me

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,320
it's basically a flying death machine

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,440
so hopefully if this all works i should

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,080
be able to connect my wi-fi

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,000
to the drone so i've got two drones me

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,600
one slammer one is louise

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,240
i'm not sure which one this is

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,080
if there are any cliffs keep them away

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,520
there louise excellent

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,520
so i will connect to that

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,400
while i'm doing that i'll just show you

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,400
the code

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,760
so nice and simple you create a drone

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,720
create a controller for the the

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,840
playstation

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,679
and then on button controls do

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:34,320
different things so is that connected

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,320
yes so if i do node ps3

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:42,559
hopefully if i press start oh

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,880
it works so i should

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,320
theoretically be able to fly the drone

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,870
with a playstation controller and try

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,080
not to kill you

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:57,840
[Laughter]

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:57,840
sorry my bad

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,840
i can normally fly it longer than that

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,240
yes exactly you've got to pay for that

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,080
oh actually if if you wouldn't mind just

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,360
undoing the battery just in case

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,240
it spontaneously decides to fly oh no

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,240
actually i do

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,240
i need it back don't i i remember

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:26,000
that's right i'll do it great

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,440
so um if if you thought that wasn't

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,559
dangerous

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,760
enough you know you think

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,320
okay i've got a

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,320
where's the

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,000
let's close that you think if that's not

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,760
dangerous enough

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,600
uh you know you control it with a

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,160
playstation controller which is really

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,080
fun

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,080
and it's really intuitive you know being

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,679
of the xbox generation we're great with

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,720
that sort of thing

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:58,400
i thought wouldn't it be cool to use a

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,400
playstation 2 dance mat

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:10,880
so if i follow the cables

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,880
and plug this in

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,840
and then run the code

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,240
and we're still connected to the drone

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,520
is the code gonna run

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,080
i don't know so hopefully if i press

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,960
start

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,960
magic should happen

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,720
oh can we go to the screen and have some

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,720
audio

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,080
because not that

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,400
because drones like dancing can we have

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,840
the screen

00:20:46,400 --> 00:21:02,010
with my laptop drone's like dancing to

00:20:49,840 --> 00:21:02,540
gangnam style

00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,700
[Applause]

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,700
[Music]

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,829
[Music]

00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,829
[Applause]

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
foreign

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,410
[Music]

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,729
[Applause]

00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,729
[Music]

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,840
so that was fun

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,720
don't look at the screen you're not

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,720
meant to see that yet

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,200
oh i need some water that was really hot

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,480
um yeah so drones really like dubstep as

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,679
well

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,520
uh as well as um korean dance music

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,039
they're not very much of a fan of

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,000
country and western you think they would

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,039
be you know with all the different

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,080
maneuvers but

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,080
turns out they don't like it

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,320
okay by the way i'm available for kids

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,000
parties

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,640
and whatnot just i might decapitate them

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,640
with a drone

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,760
okay so i've been playing with drones

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,840
and let me just unplug it because i

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,480
really don't trust the random

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,600
wi-fi signals that could randomly

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,640
control it

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,000
i don't trust any of you either um

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,000
so i've been playing with drones for a

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,200
little bit and i thought that's

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,360
fun but what else could we do

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,240
and so what i did to the other drone

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,240
just look at the camera

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,799
so friends of mine

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,520
um built this little grabber so you know

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,200
everyone's

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,200
amazon and everybody else is talking

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,520
about delivery drones

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,400
well uh we built one and so just a

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,679
little rubber

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,320
you know pencil rub at the end on a

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,919
servo and it will open

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,559
and it will close and um on the

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,000
drone itself is a little gobot program

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,960
connected to a

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,720
connected to a digispark that open and

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,840
closes the servo so you can fly the

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,240
drone around

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:17,120
and drop payload which is a great idea

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,720
until you realize the drone can't take

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,840
much weight

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,799
so you have to use your imagination for

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,400
this so if you

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,559
think now drones delivering things

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,280
what could that do what kind of magic

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,520
could you build

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,799
and i got started to thinking about

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,720
angry birds

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,159
i was like that's kind of cool i wonder

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,440
if our newfound drone

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,600
with its uh dropper capabilities

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,279
and angry birds could you know be

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,159
combined into something like

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,159
angry drones

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,520
so for this you have to imagine that

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,080
we're using this drone but unfortunately

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,000
it just

00:23:52,080 --> 00:24:00,559
can't do uh deal with the weight so

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,200
with all of that you can see

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,000
can you see my little piggy yes let's

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,159
connect this

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,159
up

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,520
right

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:23,760
so um let's load the code

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:27,360
let me just check that we've got usb

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,440
yes let's go to the code what do i call

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,440
it

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,360
not that one i name all my files

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,960
so i can remember them and then i

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,640
completely forget what i call them

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:47,840
it's in here somewhere

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,840
it will tell me

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,279
it was just proximity

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,440
oh it's because i commented at the code

00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,840
earlier that would be why

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,840
quick hacking

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,720
again um the idea was that it was going

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,559
to place a spotify track of angry beds

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,480
while we did this but uh the internet's

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,919
not so much working so

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,039
um the idea is with this um the the the

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,679
the pigs thought it was a

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,360
unnecessary advantage of the birds you

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,880
know being dropped by drones

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,320
so they too uh have some cunning plans

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,320
if we could just look at the camera you

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,520
might be able to see there's a little

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,960
ir sensor oh sorry a sonar sensor

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:37,440
attached to our smart pig so

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,799
if we run this code

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,840
if we could just quickly look so this is

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,919
using uh johnny five

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:48,080
and hopefully

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,400
if it's all wired up correctly it should

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,400
crash

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,130
no

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,249
hmm

00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,249
[Music]

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,919
oh it's not working oh basically

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,880
um the idea is the the as the as the

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,400
bird flies

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,559
closer um when it when it gets

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,400
uh within less than 10 centimeters

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,840
the pig will shout out if we can have

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,120
some volume

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,559
oh my god did that work

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,559
oh my god you heard me

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,000
so that's what it should have done but

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,159
there we go

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,400
so amazon eat your heart out i've

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,840
painted it painted all this stuff

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,840
angry drones it's a thing

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:47,200
crazy crazy ah yes right

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,120
so this is all really really thirsty

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,039
work all of this

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,400
conference talking and plugging and

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,880
plugging drones and

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,880
whatnot

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,880
and i thought wouldn't it be cool

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,640
if i could have some kind of uh drink

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,600
while i'm on stage

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,200
but you know drinking on stage is quite

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,360
dangerous because there's definitely a

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,919
fine line between drinking a little

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:19,279
and drinking a lot so

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,720
with that in mind i've built this

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:25,039
we can see that there so just while you

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:30,720
look at that i will

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,720
find the correct codes to run

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,960
is that it yes all right let's just make

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,960
sure we got the right port

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,720
so what we have on the on the not on the

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,000
screen on over on the table

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,279
is a breathalyzer

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,960
um as you do sorry let me just remove

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,559
all of that

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,559
make sure we cut the right port

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,799
copy and paste that in there excellent

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,679
right

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,679
um so if i just run this code

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,480
excellent so a breath this is just a

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,320
standard breathalyzer that your average

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,760
police person will have when you've had

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,039
too many to drink and you're driving

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,720
which you should not do

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:22,320
so that isn't a thing oh that's that one

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,760
um and what it is it's connected

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,840
uh via uh using server sent events

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,720
to this um web page with this um

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,960
hopefully this little

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,640
bar and i haven't been drinking much

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,760
today as you can

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,480
tell can we go back to the screen so if

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,840
i breathe in this

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,840
it shouldn't change if we're actually

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,279
getting so

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,279
look at the console are we getting

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:59,840
resending events should be

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,840
um seriously i haven't been drinking if

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,480
this is working if i open up this bottle

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,000
of

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,120
random uh hungarian alcohol if this is

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,960
working

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,279
which it doesn't can we go look at my

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,279
screen

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,880
no that should be going up because this

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,159
is alcoholic

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,240
ah i don't know but um it's cool

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,000
and i thought that what you could kind

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,440
of do with this is you could like gamify

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,039
drinking so you could have a competition

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,559
with your friends so like to make sure

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,320
who drinks the least

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,679
you know be sensible about it so it's

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,720
kind of like fitbit

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,320
but for our whole

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,640
so that's cool but obviously i haven't

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,120
got a drink at the moment so

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,640
it would be cool to have a drink on this

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,720
stage

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,679
and it's it's quite lucky that i

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,440
actually have

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,760
a machine for that so move my hair right

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,600
this is fiddly let's work out what we

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,799
need to plug in

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,159
okay so you probably can't quite see

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,760
over here

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,520
i have a um

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,320
arduino with a set of relays that's

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,080
connected to a set of pumps

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,080
that if i find the cable

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:23,840
let's just plug this so i have to do all

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,840
this in order so if i plug that in

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,080
fingers crossed that will switch on yes

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,159
okay now

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:37,840
i plug in the pumps with my american

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,840
eu to british safety plug system

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,520
oh they started already that's not right

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,159
because i haven't started the code

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,919
that's why

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,200
probably had to do it in order right

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,520
let's quickly look at the code

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,520
where are we drinkybot yes

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,840
let me find that that's up here let's

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,440
run that

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,039
so the way drinkybot works is um

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,640
it's currently running on an arduino but

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,960
it could also be running on

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,720
a raspberry pi or a beaglebone or a

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,080
tesla or all the other things we've seen

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,399
and it listens to mqtt messages

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,080
and for those who don't know mqtt is a

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,679
great kind of publish and subscribe

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,120
protocol that all the internet of stuff

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,760
and things uses

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:26,960
and so what we do now i can plug this

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,960
back in is we can send it

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,840
a message to say make us a drink

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,320
and if i put the helpfully labeled red

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
wires

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:46,320
there should be another one somewhere ah

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,919
so in the drink

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,760
if i could have if there are any

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,440
volunteers that would like to try

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,480
um robotic shots

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,480
got three glasses

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,559
three things i don't know how well you

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,840
can see that on the screen

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:09,440
over there and so if we then go

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:12,799
over to my screen

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,080
uh connect to the message broker

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,360
so hopefully if i publish a message yay

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,640
i don't know if you can hear that if we

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,640
can look over over here

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,519
it should start pumping alcohols

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,440
yay i don't know how well you can see

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,440
this

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,679
so the pumps i'm using here are called

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,120
peristaltic pumps you use them in things

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,440
like dishwashers

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,240
in blood transfusion machines

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,840
and so you can actually send an exact

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,360
amount of alcohol

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,960
and this is all internet connected

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,399
and it's obviously just higgledy piggly

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,080
on the table but you could imagine you

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,159
could 3d print this

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,159
and and have it all nicely with some

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,440
leds and you might think whoa you crazy

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,000
person you know doing it why would you

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,200
do this

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,880
turns out people have and they're

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,840
selling them for thousands of pounds on

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,640
kickstarter

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:15,600
this could be yours for a mere 30 pounds

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,279
so um if i could if we wait for that to

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,880
finish

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,799
thank you so it hasn't done much because

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,159
it runs quite slow but

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,240
if i could have a volunteer from the

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,200
audience ah film

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,200
would you like to try

00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:42,000
[Applause]

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,679
yay so um that's basically all my demos

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
i've just got a couple of other bits of

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:51,039
pieces that i haven't shown you um so

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,480
i bought this expensive cable which is a

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,000
dmx cable

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,320
which is meant to control these

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,159
disco lights but unfortunately i don't

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,360
know whether it was my cable or node

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,840
dmx itself it doesn't work

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,799
but we can still just turn them on so

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,520
the idea would be

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,520
that you'd be able to control um disco

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,399
lights and smoke machines

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,240
and all those other fun things all via

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,520
node.js

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,320
which is obviously super fun times and

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,359
um you might also be thinking what other

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,960
kind of

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:30,159
fun bits of hardware

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,800
is a thing missing um could i build

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,879
and somewhere on this table is a

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,919
temperature and humidity sensor

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,800
and there's this which is a moisture

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,560
sensor

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,159
so as we've seen we can control water

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,359
we can now measure temperature and

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,359
humidity we can also measure

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,800
uh whether your soil's damp or not and

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,000
you could build an automated plant

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,720
growing system

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,720
for your for your home you know to grow

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,440
those legal tomatoes that all of your

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,240
friends

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,839
like to have all all through the

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,839
internet of stuff

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:17,839
so on that slightly dubious note i guess

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:17,839
that's me so thank you very much

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,800
