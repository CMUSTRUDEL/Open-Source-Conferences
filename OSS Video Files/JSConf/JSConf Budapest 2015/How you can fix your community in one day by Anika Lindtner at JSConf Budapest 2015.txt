This talk will teach you a magic trick. 

It will show you to stop our communities from breaking apart. Studies have shown that half the women who enter the technology field will over time leave. HALF! Whatâ€™s happening? How did we get here? What can we do? 

In my talk I will show you how we can fix the diversity problem, and why we should care. I'll tell you a true story about about role models, broken stereotypes - and cat gifs. 

How to build community-driven initiatives that change our world. And the best part is: Everyone can do it. In one day.

	00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,240
so two weeks ago

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,000
this picture made my day a friend of

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,400
mine

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
and his colleague thomas they're both

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,800
programmers and as you can see they're

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,679
white

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
dudes holding a sign that says the world

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,920
will be

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,719
better when it becomes less boring

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,480
than this and they tweeted this with a

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,600
hashtag donate because

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,600
to animate people to will donate because

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,079
it donates two words rare's got some of

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,600
code to help us get more women

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,520
into open source and in the next minutes

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,079
i'm going to tell you why i love

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,280
this image so much i wanted to retweet

00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,640
it a hundred times

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,640
why they are right and how

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,240
we can make a community that actually

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,840
looks a bit like this

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,320
to a community that looks like that

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,960
magic so hi i'm anika

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,400
i'm really excited to be here and i'm

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,000
going to share with you

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,520
the magic trick on how to fix your

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,960
community

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,320
in one day so i'm going to talk about

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,640
what diversity is what it brings us

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,600
why we need it and how we can achieve

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,040
this because

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,640
diversity is achievable to

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,960
understand what's going on we need to

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,600
take a look at the field of

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,320
technology technology and engineering in

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,200
general

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,280
where we will find related issues and

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,079
roots of the problems we are faced with

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:57,600
in our communities

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,159
our world is as diverse as some

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,119
tech teams can only wish for we are

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,360
surrounded

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,719
by different age groups different

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,360
genders cultural

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,640
and religious backgrounds ethnicity job

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,800
level

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,840
bodies and abilities sexual preferences

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,720
etc

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,360
for this talk i'm mostly gonna focus on

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,599
gender

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,959
and because i'm an expert at that i'm

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,120
mostly gonna focus

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,040
on women but for a second let's see what

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,000
diversity actually would look like it's

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,040
not

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,640
one pink bubble in a lot of blue ones

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,200
or the other way around it's when you

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,400
can't see what the dominating group

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,080
is anymore since there is none and also

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,640
not everybody just fits into one

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,599
category but actually

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,599
belongs to many

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,720
did you know that only 10 percent

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,120
of the world population are white and

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,120
male

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,480
but most of the people creating the

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,800
software we use

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,760
every day all over the world are white

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,879
and male so

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,200
if we have non-diverse teams

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,200
it's because of a social imbalance

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,440
we solve the problems that we see and

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,000
people from

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,840
the same background in a team will come

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
up with the same ideas and same

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,959
solutions

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,640
on the other hand diverse teams so teams

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,799
with people from different backgrounds

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,040
and different experiences

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,920
are more creative innovative and more

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,480
productive

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,640
than a non-diverse team which has been

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,440
shown by a huge number of studies

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,840
that actually means that diversity is a

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
key

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,440
ingredient to growing a strong community

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,200
or a strong business that's built to

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,640
last and even

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,280
financially it shows that companies

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,319
that include many women in senior

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,239
positions

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,360
they show better financial results than

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,400
companies

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,959
with fewer actually no women in senior

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,959
positions

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,280
a diverse team can also capture a

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,840
greater share of the consumer market

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,799
because

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,639
studies have shown that then teams with

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,440
people from different backgrounds can of

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,160
course

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,919
more effectively market to consumers

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
from different backgrounds

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,240
and a good example for this is the

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,280
closed captioning feature on youtube

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,680
which was a huge win for google

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
and had a big impact on the consumer

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
market

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,960
so the story is that when the internet

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,440
was invented it was awesome for deaf

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,440
people

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,199
because it was all in writing and they

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,160
could understand everything

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,000
but then videos kept turning up and they

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,720
couldn't understand them anymore

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
and they were left out so the dev

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,520
engineer ken herrenstein developed and

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,639
pushed forward the release of the closed

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,040
captioning feature

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,800
for google videos which was then later

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,720
added to youtube it's this little sign

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,479
yet that you can click on and off

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,000
and then the subtitles or the closed

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,880
captioning

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,560
come up so this feature actually it had

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,400
a huge business impact

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,120
beyond the community of the deaf and

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,840
well beyond what was anticipated

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,240
so now people from all over the world

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,639
can make their videos accessible

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,080
to a super huge audience and users can

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,160
understand videos

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,600
that are not in their mother tongue only

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,000
thanks to this feature

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,120
so the world including the deaf

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,240
community

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
can connect even better and google has

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,000
proved

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:41,520
its importance on the market once more

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,080
a great example or actually a sad one

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,600
is apple's health kit which is also

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,120
included in the apple watch

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,240
they say you can monitor all the metrics

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,199
that you're most interested in well

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,880
you can monitor everything up to your

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,680
sodium intake

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,160
just not your periods something that

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,560
women have been tracking for centuries

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,000
and that is one of the health related

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,720
issues women are concerned

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,240
with every day on top of that last week

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,039
the news came out

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
that people with dark skin or tattoos

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,520
may have

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,039
problems with the watch the light

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,440
sensors the watch uses

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,520
to measure the pulse etc they may that

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,800
that actually may not work correctly for

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,520
these people

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,960
that's like an absolute fail and such a

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,880
miss out on a built side

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,400
but actually i really couldn't believe

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,160
it myself that it's so obvious

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,160
but since this is the apple theme that

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,800
tested the word

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,120
so yes if there are problems dark

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,400
skinned people could have with the watch

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,080
they for sure couldn't have noticed

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,160
so yes it could have been a great

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,199
product with even more

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,599
satisfied customers and these fails

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,280
happen when teams are not diverse and

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,639
they are not diverse

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,479
because of social injustice it's

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:05,360
how lena reinhard said diversity

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,080
is the default if it's not diverse it's

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,560
broken so

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,919
if a community is not diverse it's

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,880
broken

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,880
but let me show you

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,080
i didn't know how to move forward things

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,639
held on over the years

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,400
there was a lot i had to put up with in

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,520
the culture of tech

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,080
it just didn't seem worth it this guaran

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,800
means

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,800
she quit her job of being a programmer

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,680
after 15 years

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,680
so what's happening

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:41,039
she is not the only one women

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:45,840
are leaving the industry

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:48,000
but let's look at this closer

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,280
if we look at the path people usually

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,759
take in entering tech

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,879
we can actually imagine a kind of

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,199
pipeline

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,520
and people usually get in and they get

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,160
around they enter university they study

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,080
they

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:05,120
get a job get promoted etc but

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,160
a study from last year found that half

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,840
the women entering the field will at

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,199
some point leave

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,759
50 percent so we have actually

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,840
holes in our pipeline so at this point

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,160
we are filling a damaged pipeline which

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,840
is super frustrating

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,800
so why why does it leak why do women

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,400
leave

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,199
they leave because of hostile work

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,039
environment they're feeling isolated

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
we have a lack of career path for them

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,560
they're often overlooked

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,120
in promotions and there's a lack of role

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,680
models for them

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,000
the other thing is that we don't even

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,440
have many women in the field of tech

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,680
so around 50 of the jobs there are

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,040
all over the world it's actually quite

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,160
equal so 50

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,120
of those jobs women hold but

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,800
they're only 20 in tech and in open

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,920
source it's much worse

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,839
it's only 11 so

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,880
this is our problem out of the few women

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,680
that are making it into tech half of

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,240
them

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
are living

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,640
one of the barriers that keep women from

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,080
entering the field easily or actually

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,880
making it to the top

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,120
is that the bar is set so much higher

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,440
for women and minorities

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
research has found in blind studies that

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,480
women's work

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,279
has to be 2.5 times as good as men's

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
to be considered equally and this is

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,320
because of

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,320
unconscious bias and stereotypes we have

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,680
we love the idea that we can perceive

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,880
something by looking at it and seeing

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,080
the truth

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,320
but our truth is actually shaped by

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,200
biases and stereotypes

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,680
there's this harvard experiment it's

00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,440
called

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,959
implicit you can do it online at the

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
test on bias

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,800
and you can find it in the linked list

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,720
with my slides on speaker deck

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:12,320
so this this test found that everybody

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,519
has buyers for example 70 to 80 percent

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,200
have bias against women and tech

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,920
even women in tech have these biases

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,360
or they're preferring right white to

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,720
african american

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,160
or younger people but almost

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,120
nobody reports those biases so

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,800
this means everybody has them but nobody

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,240
thinks they do

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,880
stereotypes we learn them through

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
cultural messages or portrayals in the

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,839
media

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,160
comments from friends and family and

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,360
it's really not easy to get rid of them

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,600
but we can do it and one step is how

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,120
we treat kids so this is actually me and

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,279
my little brother

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,160
and i can't stress enough how important

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,320
we are

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,760
as role models and what opportunities we

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,560
give our kids

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,279
we should let kids discover the world

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
without

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,399
treating them differently just because

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,440
of their gender

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,200
kids are natural adventurers we should

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,720
let them live in our wonderful world

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,360
without constraining them

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,200
to role specific behavior that changes

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,399
every other century

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,800
we should let them be kids not girls or

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,800
boys

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,959
so to summarize a diverse team is not

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,320
only a representation of our world and

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,200
socially fair

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,079
it makes your team more productive more

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,320
creative

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,560
and innovative creates an atmosphere

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,800
where everybody feels more comfortable

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,760
it actually makes people stay longer in

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,320
their jobs

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,000
gets you better financial results and a

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,880
greater market share

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,200
so in three words diversity is awesome

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,320
and

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,839
achievable so great let's see what we

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,839
can do to get it

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,800
so when we look at some open source

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,399
projects

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,560
i think everybody agrees that we will

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,440
see that the commenting culture on some

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,480
projects

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,000
is really unhealthy so either we have

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,560
dismissive maintainers or

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,920
hostile comments from users that are

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,639
feeling entitled

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,079
to bug fixes or features and both sides

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,639
do have a problem

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,079
so if we as a maintainer are dismissive

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,279
about contribution and

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,639
especially about newcomers we set the

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,959
tone with that

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,519
and are creating an unwelcoming

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,560
exclusive culture around our project

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,079
or if we as users don't acknowledge that

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,880
the maintainer just usually

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,760
does this project in his or home her own

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,240
free time

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,480
there's no big company behind it this

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,240
actually can result into draining

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,519
all the fun and energy out of the

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,360
maintainer

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,079
who then more often than not has to

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,920
embed them abandon their project

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,920
because they're actually burned out

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,360
there are ways of course to start

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,519
improving that for example

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,079
putting a code of conduct on your side

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,959
or you read me so that everybody knows

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,399
that abusive sexist racist and

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,959
discriminating comments

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,320
are not welcome and that there will be

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,800
consequences

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,760
so broken down to one sentence i think

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,160
it's about

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,680
having empathy for each other and

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,959
putting ourselves

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,959
in somebody else's shoes

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,880
it's about learning how to give good

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,680
feedback

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,399
and how to receive it it's about

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,800
creating

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,600
a good documentation around your project

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,680
and treating others with respect

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,560
we have to remember that there is always

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,639
a human being behind the code

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,720
this actually applies for our online

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,600
lives as well as our offline ones

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,519
so it's it's important to address

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,959
diversity and inclusiveness

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,600
on each and every level on our personal

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,079
life and our work life if it's at a work

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,760
meeting or at a dinner with your family

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:10,160
or the conference after party so

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,160
here are three steps we actually can

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,399
take

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,760
first it's always good to start with

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,120
yourself so i really

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,279
really recommend taking the harvard test

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,160
and seeing that you do have bias

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,959
accepted

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,880
and make your unconscious bias conscious

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,680
that helps you to counteract them

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,600
it also means to question traditional

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,560
beliefs and always ask

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,399
why are we doing it this way this helps

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,199
to dismantle hidden biases and

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,839
procedures

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,839
that may produce barriers for women

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,920
we can fix some of the leaks in our

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,040
broken pipeline by

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,360
recognizing women's work that means

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,120
make sure that women's voices are being

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,519
heard and pushed them forward

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,279
show that you actually believe in them

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,560
be a mentor for somebody and share your

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,120
expertise

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,160
it's of course as key as for men to

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,760
support women

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,680
it's as important for women to do the

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
same we should connect to others and

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,519
reach

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
out we i can make myself visible

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,240
i can get off my couch more often and go

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,440
to user groups or conferences

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,480
i can take part i can make myself

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,680
visible in attending

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,240
so we should try to be the role model we

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,279
wished

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,920
we would have we would have had when we

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,560
entered

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,519
tech and i'm not saying this is super

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,519
easy it's

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,880
hard and sometimes it's horrible but

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,759
if others are supportive it's much

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,600
easier

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,160
and take a friend if you don't want to

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,600
go alone that's always what i do

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,480
hi lisa and support others

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,399
if it's with a tiny email saying hey i

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,079
really love what you're doing or backing

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,720
somebody up in the meeting

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,360
or pushing her to give a talk on a scary

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,360
big stage

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,360
so we can reach for the stars

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,800
but we need each other for that we can't

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,880
do it alone we need

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,560
support from our colleagues from our

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,199
family and friends

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,079
we can be each other's support that's

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,040
all

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,279
people of all gender cause disruption

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,680
and break stereotypes

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,399
because studies have shown that we

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,199
perform

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,120
worse if we hear that we are not good at

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,680
what we do just before we're doing it

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,040
so we should stop telling women that

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,279
they can't do math

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,440
and we should stop telling men that they

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,519
can take care of their kids

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,120
we have to break those stereotypes that

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,839
are holding us back

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,440
words are powerful we should use ours

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,480
wisely

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,600
and to show you a case study that

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,959
implemented

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,000
all this i will show you how we build

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,319
raise customer of code

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,199
let's get some of code is a is a

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,439
three-month

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,799
scholarship program that enables women

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,439
to work full-time

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,880
on or on an open source project and

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,839
actually in every language not just ruby

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,919
so let's get some of code started as a

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,919
kind of wild dream of some

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,600
rails girls berlin coaches and

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,679
organizers they wanted to give

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,720
the rescue students a perspective

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,280
because

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,120
after after the beginners workshop and

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,679
then falling in love with programming

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,039
the students are encouraged to start

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,360
their own study group

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,039
and keep on learning and with the summer

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,280
of code they actually could keep on

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,880
learning towards a goal

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,559
so the summer of code actually

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,080
took the rails girls movement to the

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,840
next level in connecting

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,360
all the good things that are happening

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,520
in the railcars community

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,120
and keeping the momentum going and

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,520
companies involved in open source

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,360
the concept is that we always have two

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,600
students pair up because

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,200
two is always better than one they will

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,440
find coaches they will

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,200
choose a project this year for example i

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,280
think we had 36

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,720
projects from open source maintainers

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,080
where they could choose from

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,760
and then they will apply for the

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,200
scholarship which is full

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,200
time and for three months

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,039
so last year 162 women applied from all

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,200
over the world

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,799
and from they were coming from super

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,880
different fields we had

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,799
movie directors and photographers they

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,280
studied human computer interaction and

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,080
french philology or worked in marketing

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,720
but they all shared the same summer they

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,880
were all

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,640
coding on open source projects

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,120
and this initiative is supported by

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,679
wonderful companies such as github and

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,480
travis ci who are partners and together

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,480
with them

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,640
and other really really cool sponsors

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,960
and many many awesome human beings

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,039
remember piazza and thomas they actually

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,200
helped us fund more money with this

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,120
so there are many amazing people out

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,240
there who donated out of their

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,640
own pocket and spread the word

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,240
and in the last two years we could

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,240
actually sponsor

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:18,000
10 teams each year this year

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,360
we raised even more money actually 120

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,120
000 us dollars which means that for the

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,360
first time ever

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,880
and nobody knows this yet you will be

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,000
the first one to know we haven't made

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,080
this official so

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,360
for the first time ever we can actually

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,520
fund

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:39,840
16 teams which is super crazy awesome by

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,840
the way

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,400
and actually in a couple of hours

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,080
we will be sending out the acceptance

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,520
letters for this year's teams

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,240
so it's really exciting times

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,400
so our program not only have sponsor

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,880
teams but also volunteering ones

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,320
who didn't get a sponsored seat but say

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,200
they want to contribute

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,200
no matter what which is really inspiring

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,480
so all in all we had 32

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,240
teams that's 64 women in two years

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,880
who worked on many different projects

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,000
such as these

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,320
we had over the last two years

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,760
and i have to say my favorite one is

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,120
speaker

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:32,000
has somebody heard of this before

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,919
yes okay so it's a tiny project

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,440
it's a hands-on fix actually to the

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,080
problem of few women

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,840
speaking at conferences or meetups it's

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,600
a database where women can make

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,159
themselves visible in signing up with

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,640
their

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,760
with their biography and with the topics

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,600
they can talk about

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,000
so organizers can actually find their

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,559
future speakers or moderators

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,280
for their conferences and events and as

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,039
we saw

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,799
not a lot of people know about this but

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,520
already there are

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,720
over 700 women in this database so we

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,400
could fill this room

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,000
twice actually and my favorite part is

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,840
that it's been built by rails girls

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,760
study group in berlin

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,520
and because they met on mondays they

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,640
called themselves

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,559
ruby monday study group ruby monsters

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,039
and sven fuchs a colleague of mine he

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,360
started the group in 2012

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,120
and the group actually kept on learning

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,240
after the first world cup workshop and

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,600
built speaker

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,520
actually while learning how to code

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,880
and two of the ruby monsters anya and

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,400
khanna who were

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,799
directing movies and working in

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,559
journalism before they made it into the

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,039
first edition of race question of code

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,360
they

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,960
contributed to sinatra and they spoke

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,520
about their some other conference in

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,159
kiev as many other teams did and with

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,240
this

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,600
they helped to spread the word and the

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,039
spark of redskins amount of code

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,600
and they are now both colleagues of mine

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,880
and are working at travel ci as

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,120
developers

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,320
they also submitted speakerenin again

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,159
for one of the

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,919
for one of the open source projects this

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,440
year and are mentoring the students

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,919
during the summer which is

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,240
where actually their story took on speed

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,880
so this is such a dream story that i

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,360
will never

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,039
tire of telling it because it shows us

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,559
whales girls and rescued some of code

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,640
made possible

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,799
but wait for it it gets even better

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,400
because carla came up to me one day

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,919
because she wanted to write a blog post

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,720
about ray's costume of code and she

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,039
asked me

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,799
what the alumni were doing actually from

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,840
the last two years and if we had any

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,159
statistics

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,640
which we hadn't so we sent out an email

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,919
asking all the alumni what they did now

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,960
and we found that over

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,919
ninety percent of our alumni

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,760
are now working in tech and eight

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,480
percent of them even founded their

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,159
startups with this which is like huge

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,559
and shows once more how

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,679
important those initiatives like raise

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,720
question of code are

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,480
and how big of an impact we are actually

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,559
having

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:09,360
so anya and carla are two of all these

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,080
alumnae and they are now all giving back

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,919
to the program that changed their lives

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,400
they are highly visible role models for

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,720
others to follow suit

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,720
so to summarize with rice got some of

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
code we are introducing newcomers

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,320
from different backgrounds to the open

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,760
source scene we are increasing the

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,159
newcomer friendliness of the

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,240
communication around the projects

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,240
we're helping to fix some of the leaks

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,200
in our pipeline by creating supportive

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,919
environments

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,159
for women for boosting their careers and

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,559
we even get more women into the pipeline

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,559
and help diversify the projects

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:47,279
and for example companies like travis ci

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,320
so all in all we created a hands-on

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,559
solution

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,919
for the lack of women problem we have in

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,159
tech communities

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,080
and motivate women to start their

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,919
journey and share it

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,919
so my journey actually started three

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,120
years ago i joined the riot skills

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,880
workshop and

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,360
to just see what this programming was

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,480
about and i was blown away

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,840
the workshop was buzzing with i think 70

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,000
enthusiastic women

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,400
and i was falling in love with ruby on

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,039
rails right on the spot and afterwards i

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,640
started

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,720
rails girls berlin with a friend which

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,480
which which grew like crazy and the

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,799
community around and then

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,559
sven started to study groups and others

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,360
followed in berlin and all over the

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,840
world

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,600
and now we have this international

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,640
movement that is rails girls and summer

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,279
of code

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,120
which is actually changing the future of

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,320
open source

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,600
and at all it all comes down to one

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,240
thing

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,720
the magic trick is you

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,400
initiatives like rails girls summer of

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
code are only possible

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,240
because so many people are putting in

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,320
some hours of their lives

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,520
and are coaching and organizing or

00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,760
mentoring

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,919
it needs people giving their time and

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,080
shows what can actually happen if they

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,080
do

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,120
so let's remove all the barriers

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,679
for women in open source and tech let's

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,080
build

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,039
thriving communities and put in our love

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,480
and support

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,840
to make some change because this is our

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,080
community

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,440
this is our responsibility and in the

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,480
end it's really not

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,640
about statistics or or

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,159
diversity as a selling factor in the end

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,440
we are talking about

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,400
social justice and building the world we

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,520
want to live in

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,799
and we want our kids to live in and the

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,600
good news is that

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,440
that change is possible and it only

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,200
takes us one day

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,039
actually it only takes us a couple of

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,400
hours a study group

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,440
a workshop a change of mind and heart

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:57,120
it's one first step

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,960
and everybody can do it we are all in

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,600
this together

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,120
so let's begin to build better

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,600
communities

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,559
and a better future together let's

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:25,840
actually not waste another second

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:25,840
and start with it today thank you

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,159
