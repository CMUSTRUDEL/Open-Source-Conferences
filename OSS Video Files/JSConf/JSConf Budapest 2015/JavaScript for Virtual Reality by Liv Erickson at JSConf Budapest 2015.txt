Is 2015 the year of Virtual Reality? Experts suggest that VR will be a 5.2B industry within the next 2 years - but right now, the majority of VR development tools require heavy game engines and specialized desktops. 

In this talk, we'll discuss the emerging support from the VR and web communities for WebVR, a new API emerging to support writing VR-enabled websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll be taking a look at existing applications for virtual reality on the web, the benefits of WebVR, and how to get started with the available tools and libraries for browser-based virtual reality written in JavaScript.

	00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,200
we got slides

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,600
all right all right so

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,320
good morning everyone um i wanted to say

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,240
i am

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,600
really excited to be here talking to you

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,359
guys um

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,800
i love virtual reality and my friends

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,240
kind of get sick of me talking about it

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,279
all the time to them so hopefully you

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,359
guys are ready

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,880
um quick question how many of you guys

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,160
in the audience have used an

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,559
oculus rift or other type of vr headset

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,040
awesome has any uh have any of you tried

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,399
building something for it yet

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,719
excellent i see a couple of other

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,960
developers in the audience awesome

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,079
i'm hoping that after this talk a few

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,640
more of you guys will want to go out and

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,719
try it

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,480
um it's a lot of fun i hope i can

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,280
convince you of that

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,680
so my name is liv erickson i am miss

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,399
livyrose on twitter and on github i

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,480
am a microsoft developer evangelist

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,719
specializing in virtual and augmented

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,199
reality technologies

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,360
i used to work in unity when i was

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,920
working on vr technology and

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,240
i got really excited about the web as a

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,000
potential platform for vr and

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,920
this is my very first time that i used

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,320
an oculus rift headset uh

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,400
it was a lightsaber demo which is the

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,720
jedi pose that i've got going on there

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,680
uh big star wars fan and my first time

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,680
using vr was

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,119
to become a jedi so i am also an

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,159
aspiring jedi knight

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,360
in vr and in real life so

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,840
virtual reality today what is it

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,680
we do not have the matrix and depending

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,920
on your opinion of

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,680
a.i might or might not be a good thing

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,360
for you i'm not i'm undecided yet i

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,159
think it could be really cool

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,520
this is the uh i think they call it the

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,600
poculus rift

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,759
april fool's day demo which was a vr

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
headset for dogs

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,200
kind of amusing i tried to get my cat to

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,079
do it he was not amused

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
hence the dog gif here so virtual

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,960
reality today

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,840
is kind of an umbrella term to just to

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,280
describe 3d computing that you wear in a

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,799
headset in front of your eyes

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,800
replace your entire reality by

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,879
whatever's on the screen in front of you

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
a pretty simple concept a lot of people

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,879
are familiar with it even if you're not

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
a developer and you've seen the matrix

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,920
which i saw for the first time two years

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
ago i'm really not sure how i

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,080
missed it for that long but uh you're

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,040
probably pretty familiar with vr at this

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,480
point

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,920
so what vr technology looks like today

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,200
i'm going to dive into the hardware

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,959
right away because that kind of gives

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,800
you a starting point to establish what

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,879
these experiences look like so

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,959
i have up here on stage in oculus rift

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,560
and it's plugged in so

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
i'm not going to go too far away from my

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,480
computer the risk of you know

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,680
yanking it out and pulling all this off

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,519
the podium

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
problem number one with desktop mounted

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,680
or head mounted displays or

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,200
hmds like the oculus rift you are

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
tethered

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,280
there are two types of virtual reality

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,000
headsets generally available or

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,560
about to become available today and the

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,640
first one

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,080
is like the oculus rift a desktop

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,480
powered display

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,319
this hardware has a lot of sensors in

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,239
there it's got lenses on the back that

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,000
look something kind of like this

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,000
hopefully you guys can kind of get a

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,879
sense of what it is it's just a lens

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,599
uh and it has a screen in front of it

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
that i

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,720
unfortunately can't show you because i

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,000
can't take the front of this off but

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,519
there's just a regular

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,920
screen kind of like a smartphone screen

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,840
in here and everything that you run

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,400
on this type of headset is powered on

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,239
your laptop or your desktop computer

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,560
so that you get to really capture the

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,159
hardware to use those and generate those

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,040
experiences you get to use the graphics

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,360
card

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,080
the cpu if you have a really nice gaming

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,599
machine which

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,280
i'm in the process of building mine for

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,920
vr

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,760
you can have some really creative crazy

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,920
experiences that look really realistic

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,760
rendering some awesome graphics

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,560
but not everyone has that and that's

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,159
okay the other type of virtual reality

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,519
hardware that is actually

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,680
available today is a mobile vr headset

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,840
and with the mobile vr headset such as

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,920
the samsung gear vr

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,680
does is it still has the casing and it

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,680
still has the lenses

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,879
but it replaces all of the stuff from

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,640
your computer with

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,720
the hardware that's powered by your

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,319
mobile phone so your mobile phone will

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,840
act as the display

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,359
and it will act as the positional sensor

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,199
the rotational sensor

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,040
anything that you run on an application

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,240
on your phone can be

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,800
built to mimic a vr app and those are

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,919
really really affordable um if you have

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,360
have you guys heard of the google

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,280
cardboard

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,199
maybe maybe some of you so it's what it

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,479
sounds like it's a vr headset made out

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
of a piece of cardboard there are

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,800
instructions on how to do it out of a

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,960
pizza box

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
um and all you have to do is add in

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,479
lenses and then stick your phone in the

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,360
front you have a vr headset

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,880
low cost lower performance but with the

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,759
high-end smartphones that are starting

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,919
to come out

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,600
that performance trade-off isn't as

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,840
great as it used to be

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,280
so these are kind of the baseline

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,960
experiences that you'll get when you

00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,759
start playing around with vr technology

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,680
today

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,280
and i'm not even going to start to go

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,400
into the number of input devices that

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,240
are available for vr

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,000
because that would be a whole other 30

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,440
minute talk in and of itself

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,039
but you can essentially you know

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,360
keyboard and mouse

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,199
basic input uh there are really cool

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,360
cameras we saw yesterday an example of

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,840
using a leap motion to uh

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,479
play the the um karaoke that they were

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,199
doing

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,000
which awesome awesome demo um you can

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,560
use that as input

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,240
for vr as well in addition to all the

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,759
stuff you've read in sci-fi books like

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,840
haptic gloves haptic

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,039
suits controllers that give you feedback

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,720
based on the

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,320
environment that you're in all of those

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,600
are options

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,039
and that's kind of as much as i'll get

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,320
into them then uh right now but if you

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,800
have questions about that please ask me

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,440
later

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,600
i will continue to rant about those so

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,440
the virtual reality app ecosystem

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,560
primarily right now uses uh unreal or

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,600
unity uh as uh which are game engines

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,000
are you guys

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,840
who's familiar with those a few of you

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,960
guys most of you guys okay awesome

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,840
uh so unity and unreal were very early

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,520
adopters of the oculus sdk and made it

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
very easy for game developers to

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,360
integrate

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,160
their headset support into their games

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,840
by using

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,360
prefabricated objects that you could

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,639
just drag and drop

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,000
into your environment because of this

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,080
we've seen a lot of games that have

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
started to emerge with vr support and it

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,280
makes sense

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,039
because games are the most natural for

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,440
us right now to kind of pick up

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,039
and experience in the first person point

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,919
of view as if we're walking around in

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,639
them

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,280
typically you don't put on you know a

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,800
character

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,720
and run around inside of your stock

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,319
portfolio but i'll show you an example

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,520
of how you can do that in vr in just a

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,560
little bit

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,919
gaming technology is very familiar from

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,840
a first person point of view

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,039
in 3d world so it made sense that that's

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,479
kind of where it started gaining

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,639
traction

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,840
as you'll see javascript is also up

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,360
there and

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,199
that's what i'm going to tell you about

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,520
today primarily

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,240
how the web is beginning to evolve as a

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,960
platform

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,960
itself for virtual reality and how you

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,479
can get started building vr apps even if

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,160
you don't have a headset even if you

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,039
don't have any specialized hardware

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,720
using javascript today i hope you guys

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,680
are excited

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,840
so javascript and virtual reality when i

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,520
started

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,960
really interested about building virtual

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,360
reality experiences

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,720
a little bit over a year ago i started

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,880
with unity because that's what everyone

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,800
said you know game engines for vr

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,000
and that was cool but i wasn't really

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,240
interested in building

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,919
games i wanted to build different types

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
of experiences that made the

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,080
information we interact with on a daily

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,720
basis more fun

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,319
more exciting and i stumbled across a

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,199
lot of really cool stuff that people are

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,440
working on

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,720
i was telling someone today a couple

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,639
days ago about it and they said it was

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,039
alpha alpha technology

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,400
which i really really love because most

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,759
of the time

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,520
i hadn't had a chance to play around

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,199
with stuff like that and vr is a really

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
awesome place if you love getting into

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,840
stuff that

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,440
doesn't have standards and there aren't

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,639
any good practices or even best

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,960
practices or

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,720
any kind of rules or regulations to

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,160
follow virtual reality is a great place

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,000
to go mess around if you want to break

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,000
stuff all the time

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,120
so so at the forefront

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,560
of virtual reality on the web is webvr

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,720
and webvr is an experimental api that

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,039
has been implemented in firefox nightly

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,160
and

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,039
certain builds of the chromium browser

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,960
this is a way that offloads interaction

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,960
with virtual reality devices

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,159
that you may have or be using to view

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,919
websites

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,519
to the browser so in your own

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,640
application you don't really have to

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,080
worry about

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,279
figuring out what types of hardware your

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,800
viewers are using

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,959
it doesn't matter if it's a desktop

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,399
application or a desktop headset

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,399
or if you're viewing it on a mobile

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,360
phone the browser will in theory take

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,399
care of all of that

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,399
for you so

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,399
you'll notice yeah ie is missing from

00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,000
this as well so it's not just

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,000
outside of microsoft i'm asking them

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,720
so with webvr

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,399
you will set your application to query

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,880
hey what are

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,800
the devices that are available and

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,360
handle all of the update stuff for me i

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,160
don't want to

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,000
tell the camera to update every time

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,920
that the user turns their head

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,600
and i don't want to do it 10 000 times

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,720
based on which type of headset they're

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,040
using

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,560
but you don't have to use one of these

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,920
browsers to get started

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,880
with webvr and i'll show you why that is

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,640
because it's kind of prohibitive if you

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,000
want to show someone like oh hey yeah vr

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,720
headset like pull this up you don't want

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,839
to

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,880
do the whole okay now go over here

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,000
install this okay oh wait you got the

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,600
wrong version

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,880
yeah no go back and do that no you don't

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,440
want to do that that's the whole reason

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,480
why we write for the web sometimes

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,000
so what's in one of these web vr

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,800
apps well if you are familiar with

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,160
3d environments and coding 3d scenes

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,079
then this should be pretty

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,079
straightforward easy there's a great

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,399
talk on 3js coming up

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,160
that will explain more about this in

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,200
detail later this afternoon so i'm not

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
going to get too much into the

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,600
environment side of things

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,360
but essentially what you have is a scene

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,040
this scene has a camera in it

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,480
which is what the viewer will see when

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,079
they're walking around and interacting

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,519
with your website and the data that it

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,839
has

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,399
in your in your application you will

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,560
have something called a vr control

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,399
this will listen to the browser for any

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,959
positional changes that your heart

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,519
the vr hardware gives the browser and

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,519
say hey

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,920
this sudden person look to the left

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,360
update everything and look that way

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,040
so you don't have to write that which is

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,079
awesome

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,279
there's a vr effect and vr polyfill if

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,120
you've tried

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,320
virtual reality and most of you looked

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,640
like you had

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,399
you'll notice that although everything

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,360
is rendered side by side

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,399
the screen itself is just one screen and

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
the vr effect

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,040
and vr polyfill objects and libraries

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,640
will handle all of that rendering for

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,399
you so you don't have to figure out the

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,800
offset for each browser or

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,480
with for each headset type you don't

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,160
have to figure out the field of view the

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,360
resolution of the device and calculate

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,320
that all yourself

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,839
um boris up here has already done that

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,839
with a really awesome rendering library

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,959
that i absolutely love

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,120
and i use for my projects and in the

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,720
case i mentioned that the browser isn't

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,160
one of the experimental ones that's

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,360
working on implementing web

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,600
web vr you can still uh

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,040
fake that effect with the vr polyfill

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
and what that will just do is split your

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,320
screen in half and say we don't know

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,160
what kind of vr stuff you're using

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
we can't understand any of that but

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,240
that's okay just render everything

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,720
stereoscopically anyway

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,079
and lastly you'll have a manager that

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,920
will handle the actual

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,320
querying for devices and kind of

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,000
translating the hardware transforms into

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,040
software transforms

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
so what does that look like well this is

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,920
my demo app

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,760
and it's it's a slide so it's not very

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,920
interesting um

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,760
we'll get there but what you can see

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,720
here is the effect has been applied to

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,560
this because

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
when i took this screenshot i was using

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,320
my oculus rift and the browser was able

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,959
to detect that i was using an oculus

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,800
rift

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,399
and apply this effect to it based on

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,760
what it knows about the

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,360
resolution of the device itself

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,360
and the field of view that the lenses

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,320
give it all sorts of really interesting

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,760
stuff that this

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
headset can tell the browser and i

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,519
haven't even begun to look at all of it

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,560
but it's really cool

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,440
so before we go into the actual demo

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,800
part of that

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,560
we'll peek through the code just a

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,399
little bit as i mentioned

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,920
i started building virtual reality

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,399
applications in unity

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,120
specifically teaching myself javascript

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,360
in order to write vr content for the web

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,480
so i'm pretty new at this bear with me

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,079
here

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,399
so the first thing that we're showing

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,160
here is creating a renderer that uses

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,639
the 3js library

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,920
and it's just a webgl renderer because

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,680
that's how it's going to display all the

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,519
content on the screen

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,360
so we create this renderer and then we

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,760
append it to our dom element

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,240
pretty simple the next thing you want to

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,000
do is create the scene itself

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,680
and handle all of the virtual reality

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,279
parts of it and i say that like oh yeah

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,320
no big deal just handle the vr stuff

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,519
right

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,160
so it actually is that easy um so what

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,639
you do

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,720
create the 3js scene once you have the

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,160
scene created you create your camera

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,839
and again this is all just using the

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,480
same libraries that you already use

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,519
if you build games in javascript and use

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,079
3js

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,079
you create a special virtual reality

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,639
control or vr control element

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,680
that will as i mentioned apply all of

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,279
the

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,800
hardware transforms that it gets from

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,600
the manager which is querying the

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,399
browser

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,760
for the hardware updates and it will say

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,920
you know create that with this

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,120
specific camera and you do the same

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,199
thing with the effect

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,800
so once you have a scene and you have a

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,560
camera and you're

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,000
the little guy in the first person point

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,959
of view for this game

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,839
the vr has already been applied with

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,199
just those few lines of code

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,959
after that create the manager the webvr

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,560
manager will go in and say this is the

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,600
renderer that we have and this is the

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
effect

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
there's a hide button equals false here

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,199
that's a few sets of optional parameters

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,360
that you can include

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,959
depending on how much of the vr

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,480
capability you want to expose to the

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,680
user if you're writing your application

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,360
that assumes

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,399
the viewer isn't ever going to use vr

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,519
you probably don't want to use this

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,120
library

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,360
but if you are building something that

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,800
can be viewed in both vr mode or not vr

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,560
mode you'll probably want to toggle

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,320
between that and that's one of the

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,079
things that the vr manager will be able

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,839
to look for

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,959
so we got one last no two last things to

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,199
look at

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,959
i refactored all of my slides i like to

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,120
say that instead of like redoing it all

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,279
i refactored my slides yesterday so

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,720
that's why we got that so you want to

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,160
create your scene at that point

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,399
now as i mentioned i'm not going to get

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,519
too in-depth with this because there is

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,959
a

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,120
someone who will describe it much better

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,320
than me later on today about

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,120
3js but i've created a 3js

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,199
element called a taurus knot and i've

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,040
made it really really huge because i

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,800
have the sole intention of getting my

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,000
user motion sick by sticking them inside

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,560
of a swinging around

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,240
rainbow really really practical use of

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,760
this technology

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,600
so i created the material in the mesh

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,480
there and i add this to my scene which

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,160
is already

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,680
aware that it's going to be rendered in

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,440
vr

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,279
and after that i read an animation

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,199
function because nobody wants to sit in

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,600
a vr experience that doesn't move that's

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,920
not

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,519
fun so instead of just putting the

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,120
viewer inside a rainbow knot we're going

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,079
to swirl it all around them

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,839
and make them really sick i can stay in

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,600
this for about 15 seconds before i'm

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,959
just like nope i'm done

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,639
and if any of you guys are brave enough

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,000
and want to try it

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,199
you'll have your opportunity in just a

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,440
minute so in the animation function you

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,160
update your controls with the

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,759
controls.update function

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,600
and then you just re-render the scene

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,839
every time this is called

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,360
after that you will just continue to

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,360
repeat the process with the request

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,959
animation frame function and that will

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,160
update everything automatically

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:08,079
and it's spinning relatively fast

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:11,360
so this is what it looks like

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,320
all together this this whole thing right

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,199
here is my vr application in javascript

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,160
i used a couple of libraries uh because

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,759
as i said i

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,600
just started learning javascript to do

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,240
this and i don't have a lot of the

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,759
background

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,680
knowledge required to figure out how to

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,279
query for devices and how to go through

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,560
and parse all of the field of view stuff

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,040
and calculate all of that

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,079
i did not major in 3d graphics so that

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,440
was all really new to me

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,360
which is why i really appreciate this

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,560
render boilerplate library

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,600
but this is the whole code block

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,959
for rendering something in vr it is

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,399
about 20 lines of code so let's see it

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,839
in action that's the fun part that's

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,120
what you guys want to see with this you

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,560
don't want to just hear me talk about

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,720
virtual reality you want to see virtual

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,759
reality that's kind of the whole point

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,800
so let's see it in action i

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,399
will now switch over and we're having

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,199
good luck on the demos so far

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,360
so bear with me here this is the

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,199
application that i just showed you

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,520
i have affectionately dubbed it rainbow

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,199
knots or motion sickness simulator

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,880
whichever you choose

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,240
and as you can see it is using the

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,319
polyfill right now

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,439
because despite the fact that i am using

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,799
the webvr enabled build of chromium yes

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,760
that is the one i went with today i

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:27,039
switch back and forth a lot

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,880
it's already rendering in vr so

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,120
this particular application will not

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,520
work in a non-vr browser

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,120
but if you're using the polyfill and

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,960
you're not being really specific about

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,840
the checks like i was to make sure that

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,559
it works

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,480
this will work in any browser so this

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,640
despite the fact it is in

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,440
this side-by-side stereoscopic rendering

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,000
mode isn't actually

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,480
in what they would consider vr rendering

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,960
mode

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,039
so i do have the oculus here as you can

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,640
see i pick it up and i can kind of move

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,120
it you can see what's going on

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,080
that's not a fun way to demo vr does

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,000
anybody

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,679
want to come up here and be brave enough

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,280
i have a very enthusiastic person over

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,120
there come on up

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,120
and demonstrate the positional tracking

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,080
here with the vr

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,760
so as you can see this hit the f key to

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,360
engage vr rendering

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,280
is just going to tell the user hey you

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,559
know if this was all rendered in one

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,880
position

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,520
you could make this vr enabled all right

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,559
so hello what's your name

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,000
dennis all right so we're going to i

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,600
warn you it's going to be a little

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,960
dizzy put this on just slip it over the

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,840
head here

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,559
strap it on like that and we are going

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,760
to

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,520
put it in vr mode so you can see that as

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,760
dennis looks around all of the

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,799
positional uh tracking is being applied

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,000
to the headset

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,240
and he is completely immersed in this

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,160
and as tends to be the case when you're

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,520
doing a vr demo

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,080
no one can tell what you're looking at

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,600
in most situations you guys get to see

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,240
so we will oops allow that

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,280
in full screen and get the mouse out of

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,960
the way this is like the biggest

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,240
problems like where does my mouse go

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,919
when things are in vr so as again

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,000
this is only 20 lines of code to get

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,440
this working it's really really simple

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,720
but you could make it as complex as you

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,320
want it based on

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,039
what you were actually rendering in your

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,039
scene so

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,799
at the risk of uh making too much of a

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,360
mess yeah just go ahead and pull that

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,640
off right there

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,640
thank you very much yeah

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,679
so we now have seen 20 lines of code

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,200
my first vr app um

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,799
i have a couple of slides in here and

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,840
we'll switch back over

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:47,360
to this that just shows a little bit of

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,840
what the boilerplate code that i use

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,120
goes into i did not write this i am

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,559
really glad that someone else did

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,000
because it enables a lot of other web

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,600
developers to kind of dive right in here

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,520
without knowing the specifics

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,880
but uh this is just a little bit of

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,280
information about these

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,720
two specific javascript files that come

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,760
as part of the boilerplate code if

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,120
you're interested

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,679
in kind of looking at it at a little bit

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,080
of a lower level so what we have here is

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,480
the vr manager class and as you can see

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,320
it's got a prototype function that

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,240
checks to see whether or not the browser

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,960
is webvr compatible or not

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,760
now i mentioned my previous demo did not

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,720
work

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,000
in a non-vr browser because i did not

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,000
use this is vr

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,440
or web vr compatible function i just

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,440
said no assume it's

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,039
it's assume it's available and that was

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,919
bad coding practices on my part

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,039
i'll admit it so this will check hey

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,159
navigator

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,600
do you recognize this um and if it does

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,280
it will then go through and say okay

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,400
well is there a head-mounted display

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,120
available

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,400
now there are two types of things that

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,919
the browser will recognize

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,679
as being a virtual reality enabled

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,120
device the first is

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,720
the display type the headset itself

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,760
and this is what it will return if it

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,400
finds this part of the oculus rift

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,799
there is a second or a mobile phone that

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,760
is in vr mode

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,600
this here and i hope you guys can see it

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,080
if not just come find me i'll be around

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,360
hands on

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,039
grab it play with it is another part of

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,840
the oculus rift that is known as a

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,679
positional

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,600
tracker and that is what the browser

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,720
will iterate on and say hey

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,880
we have a vr display device and we have

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,000
other devices input devices output

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,360
devices

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,720
any kind of device you can think of

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,039
pretty much with vr and i've seen some

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,640
weird ones

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,480
any other type of device that isn't a

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,159
display device will still be enumerated

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,120
by the browser and say hey we've got

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,960
these available

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,720
i think by the default by default it

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,200
picks the first one that it finds

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,440
um if you have multiple vr headsets

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,159
plugged in at once then i'm jealous

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,840
um so that's what this is doing here is

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,720
it's going in and saying hey find all

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,080
the devices

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,280
and tell me that they're there

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:58,000
the vr effect class here or

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,679
library i think is what they are um

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,360
we'll go in and say all right so we're

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,960
going to take the camera that you made

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,440
and we're actually going to

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,880
kind of rip it apart and use two cameras

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
instead i don't want to worry about two

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,799
cameras

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,960
in my scene i've done it before on

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,520
accident and it's a mess

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,200
so this effect is really nice because it

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,120
will do that automatically for you

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,600
and it will say take a camera for the

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,600
left eye take a camera for the right eye

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,960
and ask for all the details about the

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,799
device that you can get

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,320
what is the screen resolution what is

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,400
the window height what is the window

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,280
with what is the field of view

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,600
on the lenses so how far away from my

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,840
eyes can i see things with this device

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,720
and then apply that to the device that

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,799
you found

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,720
from the device that you found and

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,039
create that effect

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,440
automatically so if i'm using something

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,360
that has a really high screen resolution

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,480
i don't want my effect to be the same as

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,480
if i'm using something

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,400
with a really tiny one because it's just

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,400
going to feel really weird and

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,840
a big part of virtual reality feeling

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,720
comfortable is that it doesn't feel

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,159
really weird

00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,600
so it's nice to not have to handle that

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,039
by yourself because you know that if

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,280
every developer implemented this

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,559
differently it would not create a

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,559
consistent vr experience

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,000
so there's some other examples that i

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,039
want to show you guys because

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,039
some people are starting to build really

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,320
really cool stuff with this not just

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,520
something that's going to swirl around

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,120
and make you sick

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,880
and i want to share some of those with

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,679
you guys to hopefully inspire some of

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,600
you that have

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,039
maybe been thinking of ideas of stuff to

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,360
build

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,960
and making that possible so the first

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,120
thing that i hear a lot is

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,159
well why would you use virtual reality

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,640
as a developer

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,520
well one it's really fun okay that's

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,400
that should be enough

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,679
but it's not always so one thing that i

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,520
like to tell people is well it'd be

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,720
really cool to be in vr

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,039
and have a whole bunch of different

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,840
screens around me so i don't have to

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,600
pester

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,520
my hardware department every time i want

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,080
a new monitor or something fun to play

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,240
with

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,320
and someone else suggested a virtual

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,000
reality simulator for virtual reality

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,559
devices which i thought was an awesome

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,320
idea

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:03,440
um but yeah you know you get that a lot

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,320
and what i what i hear people wanting is

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,159
examples of coding in vr and i couldn't

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,320
unfortunately get a live demo of this to

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,799
work that's kind of the state of web vr

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,559
and virtual reality on the web right now

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,159
but this is an example of an application

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,840
called risk sketch

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,840
and this developer created an

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,039
application that lets him write

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,240
3js code while he is in vr

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,320
so he's directly editing everything

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,919
in his environment as he's you know

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,240
sitting in it

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,000
that's really really awesome again

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,039
here's the sleep motion that we've heard

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
about

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,000
he's using that to pass through the

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,200
image of his hands on the keyboard so he

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,159
can see what he's typing as he's

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,880
developing

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,799
that tree at the beginning is not there

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,919
if you watch the full video and i

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,360
recommend going to this link and

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,880
checking it out because brian's work is

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,720
really awesome

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,600
you can see that he actually starts

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,760
creating these trees and these objects

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,360
in real time and it's just one of the

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,120
examples where you can start to see the

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
power of virtual reality and what it

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,919
enables you to do

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,080
when i first started learning 3d

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,240
development on a two-dimensional screen

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,760
it's really hard to figure out exactly

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,279
where everything's being placed

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,520
how easy it's going to be for the user

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,600
to walk around through the environment

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,200
and virtual reality makes that much

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,559
easier because you could literally get

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
off your chair and just be like ah okay

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,440
yes

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,200
yeah that looks right okay go back to

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,640
work simple

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,080
really really interesting um once i can

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,679
get this working on my own machine i

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,039
will absolutely use this to code my 3d

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,000
environments

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,559
so i mentioned earlier stock market and

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,320
your portfolio prices your bank account

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,279
it's pretty boring looks like that might

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,640
be getting cut off a little bit at the

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,679
edge but

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,320
the last letter of city is why um

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,799
so this is something coming out of

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,360
fidelity labs it's an early prototype

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,120
that actually takes someone's stock

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,279
portfolio or bank account

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,600
and visualizes it as a city so they can

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,880
walk around within their stock city

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,200
and see how their money is doing

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,480
effectively and they do this in this

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,320
form of buildings

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,520
so i'm going to actually show you this

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,840
one live

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,520
i got it working last night right before

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,559
the party

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,679
and you can see here that they are using

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,679
again the polyfill to render this

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,919
even though we don't have it in vr mode

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,919
yet

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,520
i like how the buildings are transparent

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,080
you don't get that all the time in real

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,600
life and

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,679
that's one of the fun things about vr it

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,720
doesn't have to be realistic

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,480
so in this city i'm you know using the

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,960
arrow keys walking around

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,559
it's pretty cool you can come over here

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,440
i think microsoft's over here somewhere

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,200
i can

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,600
maybe see it ah there we go right there

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,200
in the back cool

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,440
which is neat you're seeing this in a

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,080
new way it's a different way of thinking

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,000
about

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,799
something that was previously in my

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,320
opinion a little bit boring

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,279
so you just go in here and say okay

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,840
toggle vr mode

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,840
and we do that and again we see when we

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,159
look around in the headset

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,440
you can now experience the full scale of

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,760
your city

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,360
run around here the buildings are not

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,720
just transparent there you can walk

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,480
through them

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,240
but it's a really cool prototype to kind

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,440
of show you how vr can be used to

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,480
visualize things in different ways

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,679
so um switching back over here real

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
quick and i'm just going to throw this

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,200
up so

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,720
you can see the link here

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,720
visor create create.visor.io

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,480
this is an interesting application of

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,159
javascript and virtual reality

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,760
because you can build virtual reality

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,799
environments in your browser

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,559
right away drag and drop programming

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,480
it's a really interesting way to kind of

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,399
play around with 3d graphics

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,919
and this one's been crashing on me a

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,559
little bit so i'm hoping it doesn't

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,960
today

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,000
i have an example of this right here and

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,360
if i go up to the

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,640
root element i've just dragged this in

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,080
from the templates that they've already

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,840
pre-defined up here you can see there's

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,919
a vr template right there

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,760
so you can go through drag this in drop

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,080
it you're good to go

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,840
once you do that all you have to do is

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,720
edit the stuff in the render loop

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,279
edit the scene build some stuff i built

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,279
a planet

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,840
and you can play the button there and

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,240
see that it's rendering stereoscopically

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,520
again

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,600
in the background so i can see what i'm

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,919
creating as i'm creating it love to get

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,399
in more detail about this

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,080
but i want to save time for q a so i

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:27,440
will just show you that this

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,480
um outputs to a json file that

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,200
represents your graph

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,200
that is then loaded into a webgl canvas

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,799
so i can walk around

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,320
i can look all around me it's not the

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,919
most interesting scene but you get the

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,039
idea you're building stuff

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:45,600
for vr in your browser drag and drop

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:47,600
really straightforward

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,960
i have a lot of information about all of

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,080
these and a link that i'll give you in a

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,440
couple of slides so

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,799
looking ahead these are the things that

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,840
are complete enough to talk about but

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,520
too broke into demo for you guys today

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,840
these are projects that i'm working on

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,520
that are webvr javascript

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,520
and what we have here is visual vr

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,960
i mentioned i'm really interested in

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,320
taking data that's kind of

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,320
boring right now and making it

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,919
interesting with vr so i'm working on

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,840
a application that will parse through

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,720
excel files and

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,240
create graphs based on that i have the

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,080
graph part working but the text

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,520
does not work and that makes your chart

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,000
pretty unusable so

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,600
that's why that's not getting demo today

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,200
second this is my cat

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,200
contribution to the conference

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,080
i am working on a a game called kitten

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,159
collector vr

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,000
what i'm trying to do here is hack

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,840
unity's exported webgl

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,320
files so that instead of using the

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,240
renderer that works with the 3js library

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,679
you can find and run or create a

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,760
renderer that

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,279
takes all of the outputted files from

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,760
unity when you build a

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,919
webgl app and you can apply the

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,039
rendering effects there

00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,720
that part is very early in its

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,120
development stages

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,399
but i'm excited because the kitten part

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,520
is done and that's the fun part

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:10,320
so why build for vr it's freaking

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,000
awesome uh i don't really i hope i don't

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,640
have to convince you guys too much that

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,720
uh

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,760
vr is really fun and really entertaining

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,960
to build for

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:22,320
uh i'll just leave you with this uh

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,760
facebook bought oculus last year

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,159
for 2.2 billion dollars and industry

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,480
experts suggest that by 2020

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,080
it will be an industry valued at about

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,000
150 billion

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,240
that's about half of what all of the

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,960
mobile phone industry is right now

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,559
that's a lot of money and that's a lot

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,720
of opportunity

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,000
so it's freaking awesome and there's a

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,799
lot of potential here

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,840
it's really really new alpha alpha

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,360
technology

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,360
if you want to build something that

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,080
doesn't just use technology but helps

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,240
kind of

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,120
define how future users will build

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,519
technology

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,440
this is a really great way to do it so

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,159
it's your turn

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,000
what you want to see here everybody well

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,440
not everybody loves the matrix so i

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,640
don't know how neo felt about it at some

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,039
points but

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,559
it's really fun and if you guys want to

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,559
go ahead and get started i have a bitly

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,399
link up here

00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:15,919
jsconfvr that will kind of give you a

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,519
more detailed outline of everything that

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,600
i've talked about

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,880
up here and includes all the links and

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,440
all the stuff that i wish i could have

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,679
just

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,039
stayed and talked about for probably you

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,679
know the whole rest of the day if they

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,120
let me

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,120
um js comp vr

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,159
it will link to a bunch of helpful stuff

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,679
so

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,320
again i want to say thank you that was

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:46,240
my last link and now we will i guess do

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:48,880
q a

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,480
exciting mic is it working okay cool uh

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,919
so that was exciting because

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,720
there was a mysterious mca disappearance

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,080
and there was vr so i don't know where

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,000
we go from now

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:05,039
um we don't have much time unless

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,080
well we'll see well first question is

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,720
really funny

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,679
but i think it's really important um

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,279
where can i get

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:16,080
the oculus for my dog

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,399
so poculus rift i'm not entirely sure

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,760
but

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,600
it looks like they're just using a

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,960
google cardboard with a sticker on it so

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,720
if you can find the cardboard and the

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,640
sticker you're probably good to go

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,840
and you can buy those online for about

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,039
twenty dollars

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,960
i guess problem solved um

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,240
okay you kind of answered that question

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,880
at the very end but

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,880
maybe you can elaborate any ideas about

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,559
what you can do in browser

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,799
vr aside from games

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,919
so i've started to see a lot of really

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,919
interesting

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,200
applications of vr technology the stock

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,240
market one was the first one that i

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,480
heard of but

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,080
there are a lot of opportunities for

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,360
kind of any industry to start picking

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,919
this up and building

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,760
things with it so a big place that i

00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,919
think is a lot of potential for vr is

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,080
education and building applications that

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,159
get kids interested in coding

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,440
um and that you know it can be

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,279
browser-based or

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,799
desktop-based and i don't see why the

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,240
why not the browser because you know

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,279
we're seeing a lot of really interesting

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,600
stuff come there

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,039
um education and you know the medical

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,799
industry have started to use virtual

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,640
reality technologies to some

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,320
some pretty substantial degrees of

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,360
success um

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,799
it's kind of hard to answer that

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,720
question because in my head i feel like

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,320
everything will eventually use vr so

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,399
pretty much anywhere you can think about

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,919
using vr um

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,600
the browser is a good spot to start with

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,120
that and if you want to talk specific

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,640
ideas come find me afterwards because

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,440
i've got like 20 that i want to see

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,679
implemented

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,919
but i don't know if now is you know the

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,120
best use of the q a type so

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,399
um someone wants to know is there a

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,200
boilerplate

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:50,399
available somewhere yes uh so the link

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,399
will be at the jsconfvr that i had there

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,159
off the top of my head i i think it's

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:58,480
it's boris miss

00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:01,279
uh b-o-r-i-s-m-u-s

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,880
slash webvr boilerplate on github that's

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,480
the one that i showed here and the one

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,720
that i use in my projects

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,800
i think that will be the last one the

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,800
weirdest vr device you've heard of

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,440
um if we're going i'm gonna go weird

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,919
cool and this goes into the headset

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,560
still rather than an input device but

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,720
the

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,000
coolest headset that i've seen is called

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,320
the fove and it does

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,079
gauge tracking so the demo for that was

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,839
pretty much just being a terminator

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,280
where you had this headset on shooting

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,520
lasers out of your eyes

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,800
that was weird but also really awesome

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,639
because right now we just use our eyes

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,240
for seeing which is kind of boring

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,359
um and the weirdest kind of device that

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,560
i think i've seen

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,679
is again it's it's not entirely weird

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,599
it's weird that it's

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,960
actually being built right now i guess

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,599
is um

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,440
there's a hang gliding experience for vr

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,240
and someone built like this huge rig for

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,000
it so you like

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,839
lay in this little hammock and then they

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,800
swing you while you're in vr that was

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,359
kind of weird

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,160
um so i'd probably say something like

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,839
that seeing

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,040
seeing the weird but awesome stuff that
