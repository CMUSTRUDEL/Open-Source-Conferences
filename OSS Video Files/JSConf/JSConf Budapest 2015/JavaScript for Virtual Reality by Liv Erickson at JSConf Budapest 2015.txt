Is 2015 the year of Virtual Reality? Experts suggest that VR will be a 5.2B industry within the next 2 years - but right now, the majority of VR development tools require heavy game engines and specialized desktops. 

In this talk, we'll discuss the emerging support from the VR and web communities for WebVR, a new API emerging to support writing VR-enabled websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll be taking a look at existing applications for virtual reality on the web, the benefits of WebVR, and how to get started with the available tools and libraries for browser-based virtual reality written in JavaScript.
