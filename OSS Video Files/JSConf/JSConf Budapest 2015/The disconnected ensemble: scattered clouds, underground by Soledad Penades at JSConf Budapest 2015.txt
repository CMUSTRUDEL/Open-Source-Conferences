Leave the routers and repeaters, the cabling and the splitters all behind. Just bring those phones, and let's go underground. Let's sit on a train and play music, left to our own devices, with our own devices.

[Applause]

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,199
go away

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,640
hi sia that doesn't mean sia but it

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,080
means hi in hungarian

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,840
i learned that yesterday um so

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,400
i'm sold out panades everyone calls me

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,160
soleil and i'm super swollen twitter i

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,560
decide to add it here so everyone knows

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,720
who i

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
am which i guess if you want to judge me

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,960
or whatever you know

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,040
who to judge and i work at mozilla you

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,200
might have heard about firefox os

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,200
it's present in hungary so if you go to

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,200
thailand or to a shop in telenor

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,320
you can just go out there and buy a

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
phone so that's cool

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,160
we're in 29 countries and 14 global

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,680
operators like telenor

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,039
orange telefonica so that means that

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,199
instead of being this virtual thing that

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,719
you can go to ebay and buy like this one

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,719
of those weird firefox response you can

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
actually go to a shop and like try them

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,920
before so that's

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,199
that's cool because we did all this

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,880
thing in just two years

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,920
and like we were like okay this is

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,880
recall but

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,720
i don't know um writing this whole thing

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,840
in javascript like this phone

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,200
is actually fully written in javascript

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,799
except for the parts that interface with

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,920
you know like the the drivers and

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,720
everything which is c

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,119
but it ends up being javascript so

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,280
writing all this in javascript and

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,040
dealing with all those telcos which are

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,159
weird i want your money and all the

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,680
things and we still survive

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,200
maybe we haven't gone far enough so we

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,400
were like okay

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,560
so how do we go further

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
and of course we asked that question and

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,560
the answer like

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,320
any modern digital agency does nowadays

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,280
is we brainstorm

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,799
and so we formed like 50 or more groups

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,680
there was like this huge list which i

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,960
didn't bother

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,360
counting because it wasn't like a

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,680
northern list so it was 50 or more

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,399
and the way it worked was like you could

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,240
just like

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,680
join groups and it wasn't like normal tv

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,920
would be like oh i want to do

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,799
this group to experiment about having

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,439
more cats

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,000
in our phones or you could say oh i want

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,200
to experiment

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
about these other things so there were

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,160
lots of different um

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,879
ideas and like things you wanted to

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,840
think about but

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,440
you hadn't had time so they the whole

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
purpose was to stop for a month

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,840
and generate ideas and like kind of like

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,160
leave your brain or for whatever so

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,000
some of the ideas were obvious like one

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,200
of those is streamline the build system

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,879
which is like something

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,239
like if you've been working on a project

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,239
for two months

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,680
after two months you want to redo the

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,400
whole thing so imagine if you have a

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,400
project which

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,920
is two years so you want to redo whole

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,720
the whole of this

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,040
and and the thing is that when firefox

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,920
was

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,280
started there was power there was

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,000
required

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,879
like require the the weird one there was

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,280
npm

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,120
there was many other things but no one

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,000
was actually the real package management

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,080
system winner

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,640
so it's because they couldn't really bet

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,680
on anyone they made up their own thing

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,560
using sure runner with xpc shell make

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,920
files and

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,000
all sorts of weird things so when we try

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,480
to teach people firefox os two years

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
after

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,720
they actually come from the web and they

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,840
look at that and they're like

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
make files

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,560
and they just disappear so we actually

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,000
need to fix a thing so that's one of the

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
reasons we wanted to streamline the

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,519
build system make it more approachable

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,360
and already is like how do you rest in

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,080
the code structure because this is two

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
years after

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,040
there are many apps written in

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,040
javascript and each one is written a

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,599
different way and new contributors like

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,440
might

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,200
learn how to use one or how to hack on

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,480
one app but then go to the other one and

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,360
they're like this is so different i

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
don't know how to

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,519
i need to re learn the whole thing and

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,280
there was another thing which is

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,120
delivered more polish when firefox was

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,959
started there wasn't any web workers

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,040
webgl wasn't as stable as it is right

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,200
now there wasn't any service worker

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,720
so many things were done the old way and

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,480
we know that we couldn't do things

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,319
way more polished nowadays but we are

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,159
not doing that yet so one of the ideas

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,400
was like well let's do this thing now so

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,560
that was that was all very sensible

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,480
but of course i'm not a sensible person

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,319
and i'm into the risky ideas

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,760
so one of the ideas i like was how do

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,720
you rethink smartphones so they are

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,079
actually smart

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,359
and instead of being this dumb phone

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,160
which is interesting interrupting you

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,040
all the time

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,519
to let you know that you have

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,960
notifications or

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,560
this one which is really cool suppose

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,479
you have a family with

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,800
five members and one of them which is

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,000
like the rich one has a

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,600
proper contract plan and the other ones

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
are just using players you go why

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,840
do everyone have to download the system

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,440
update why can't just the contract

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,320
person download the system update and

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,600
then send it

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,360
and share it with all the other phones

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
because all them are using wi-fi

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
so this is the kind of ideas that are

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,320
very interesting and for people that are

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,479
in the first world

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,160
as we are it's like why would you want

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,520
to do that thing just go and download it

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,800
but for people who are in a place where

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,479
connectivity is report

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,080
this is really cool so these kind of

00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,280
ideas like okay we have these devices

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,039
that can do all these things why are we

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,800
not doing this

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,400
so that's that was something that was

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,639
really really exciting and

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,680
also how can you have context our phones

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,080
phones that react

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,960
and use the sensors to be again more

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,479
intelligent

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,479
way more interesting that they are right

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,240
now so this is

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,720
really interesting but the one i really

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,400
liked was the peer-to-peer web

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,639
and this doesn't have anything to do

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,600
with pirating movies or music or

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,120
anything like that

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,560
but it's about dropping the web and

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,560
surfing locally that means that we

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,720
should connect to devices we have around

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,160
and our phones are super aware of are

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,639
super super capable of doing those

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,360
things

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,199
we are not doing that right now like

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,960
today when you want to send data between

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,759
devices you often have to send them to

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,639
the cloud

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,080
and then come back and even when those

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,360
devices are like physically closed

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,680
as is the case here and this is stupid

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,120
or nonsense or however you want to

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,960
describe that

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,639
but of course that's a business model

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,160
for many companies that they love to see

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,120
what you're doing they love to look at

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,759
your data

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,319
and do things i don't know which kind of

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,560
things

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,759
and actually mozilla has no interest in

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,720
doing that kind of thing so we're in a

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,319
good position to

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,240
actually empower you to control your

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,000
data so i was like well

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,520
we actually can do this thing because

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
the people can't because they're

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,800
investors or they're

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
um you know like the important people

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,560
are going to say no way you're going to

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,400
give people ability to not to show us

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,280
what they are doing

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,600
so i kept looking at the web pro that i

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,360
like

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,720
the peer-to-peer prototypes and i was

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
like okay there is this thing where

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,199
people are sharing files between phones

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,319
and like

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,199
they're sending pictures of their doctor

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,960
and it's like that picture is not going

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,800
anywhere else other than the adult

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,319
network they just created with wi-fi

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,240
direct so this is really cool

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,240
like dropbox is not seeing those

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,280
pictures this is as private as it can

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,960
get

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,360
and then there was also another version

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,960
where someone would be running a sega

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,720
mega drive emulator running in

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,240
javascript in a phone

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,240
and then it would be sending the frames

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,120
to another phone or all over like

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,880
peer-to-peer

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,160
and they could be playing columns one

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,479
against the other

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,840
and again this was a running javascript

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,680
and then there was this other one where

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,000
you could just discover devices

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,759
with this protocol called wifi direct

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,880
and you can just like find things around

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,160
you don't even need to set up the

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,680
network and that's what they use in

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,360
japan and taipei for

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,919
configuring uh tvs and devices

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,360
so it's like wow this is a javascript

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,599
and this is all running on fonts

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,960
which means that it makes programming

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,919
things for phone really approachable you

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,280
don't have to learn

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,960
you know like java or objective c and i

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,280
of course i'm a thinker and of course i

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,120
wanted i was excited and i was like

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,800
i want to tinker and make cool stuff and

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,800
i want to make it right now

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,000
but for once i was a little bit sensible

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,479
i was like okay stop and

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,759
think what you want to do because i was

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,759
going to like start doing things but

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,280
nothing would make sense

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,479
so i was like okay so peer-to-peer stuff

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,919
is very social

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,520
and this is going to be a huge challenge

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,800
for me because i'm

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,120
i tend to do things which are really

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
anti-social like things are like just

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,560
one person playing

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
with some music or whatever but that's

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,879
it

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,720
so we'll be like okay i need to learn

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,599
how to do things where more people can

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,280
play

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,879
and then there's also this thing where

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,639
people say oh javascript is the story

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,240
language where you cannot do anything

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,919
serious with javascript

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,280
it's like well this is another challenge

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,199
let's show them that we can actually do

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,199
something serious with javascript

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,360
and then finally if you know me you know

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,280
that i don't like i love music

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,639
so i kind of like joined the whole

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,360
things together and it's like okay so

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,520
what about

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,199
musical toys well if i can just build

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,319
something that can run on phones and

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,519
it's musical

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,120
and it's social as well and

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,560
we are not going to need the internet

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,159
once we have this thing

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,680
we don't need to be connected to

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,000
anywhere to play this is not like

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,080
playing

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,240
a ps3 or ps4 you need to download three

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,000
gigs before you can get to the menu

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,279
um and if we do this thing right with

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,800
service workers and the kind of things

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,360
you can even keep the toys afterwards so

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,760
we are kind of

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,200
multiplying the resources and this was

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,320
super super super cool

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,399
i was super excited um so

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,000
i was like okay we are going to make a

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,000
band this is going to be

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,480
better than laptop musicians we are

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,279
going to be the disconnected and symbol

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,920
so i'm kind of like recruiting people on

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,680
each

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,720
of these situations so today we're going

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,560
to have a friend which is waiting here

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,399
because bands are more than one person

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,480
so it has to be social

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,080
so the question is how do we make this

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,640
thing happen and there is

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,320
a plan of course and the first one is we

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
make the musical toys then we put them

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,399
on a device

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,640
then we make them available to other

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,120
devices and then we play music and have

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,000
fun

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,800
so that's four easy steps so the first

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
one

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,760
is making the musical choice and we are

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,519
going to go like super modular here and

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,120
so we're splitting things around so each

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,640
toy is actually two parts

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,880
the first one is a web audio based or

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,000
you know so all the music side is built

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,240
in just one module

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,320
and the web component based ui which is

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
all the things we see

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,600
so the web audio knows i don't know if

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,680
you know about web audio but

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,279
webod is really modular it's about

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,040
having this number of

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,360
sources of sound and you can connect

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,000
them to others boxes that can filter

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,200
modify

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,440
the sources of sound you can like ending

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,880
up like sending all this into this kind

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,480
of sync which is actually called the

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,920
destination so this is kind of like this

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,120
stream that ends up in the

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,680
destination which is actually the

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,079
speakers and this is really really good

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,000
for

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,760
making toys because we can just do one

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,160
of those boxes and connect it to

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,000
existing things and we can reuse code

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,160
which is really really neat

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,279
so as i say one toy is going to be one

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
audio note

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,040
and i'm basing this on the open music

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,079
pattern which is another project i'm

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,360
working on

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,480
and the idea is that you take another

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
context which is kind of like the

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
equivalent

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,680
it will do you know to canvas context so

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,079
that gives you tools and methods

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,279
and it will return you an audio note and

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,760
you can just connect it

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,720
to anything in the graph so in this case

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,560
for example i've got this

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,000
theremin and i'm using browserify so

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,839
everything is like node

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,279
and i'm using i'm requiring that i

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,040
create the other context then i

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,880
create that new theorem with this thing

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,320
and then it's just javascript object so

00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,519
i can just say start or change the

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,040
properties and

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,440
like that kind of thing so that's pretty

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,959
natural and

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,480
and then for the web component ui i know

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,920
web components are confusing and like

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,760
very esoteric but essentially

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,240
this is something that really works well

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,000
with representing ui things

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,279
and since audio notes have these

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,360
properties and these

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,399
events that they are made we just need

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,000
to

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,920
build a custom element that represents

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,360
this particular component

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,360
and and that that's all we need so

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,560
custom elements if you haven't gone into

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,720
web components

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,240
this is a part that lets you define it

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,839
lets you define new types of dom

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,880
elements so the browser knows about this

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,519
new thing

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,279
and just as you can do a new cr you can

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,279
do create element table you can also say

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,519
create element of a music firm in ui

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,959
so this is something i just taught the

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,760
browser and the browser knows how to do

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,360
that thing

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,200
and once you have the element you can

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,040
append it you can append it to the body

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,519
or do any other thing you would do with

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,760
an html element the only special thing

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,279
here is the attach to method which is my

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,800
kind of own convention

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,720
and you would see that i'm attaching

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,440
that to the theory node which is

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,079
the web audio thing we created before

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,399
and

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,360
we're doing these things so that we set

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,200
up the listeners

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,959
on on events on the audio like suppose

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,519
you have a node which is playing a

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,560
sample

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,240
you need to know when that thing is

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,240
finished so you can play you can

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,800
activate the play button again

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,240
and then you can also add listeners for

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,639
events on the interface

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,160
so if you play if you press play the

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,600
thing gets to play again so you need to

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,680
get everything in sync

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,920
so that's about what you need actually

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,720
to do and the other good thing

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,160
is because both things are not like you

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,440
are writing one thing without actually

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,720
depending on the other

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,560
and if you are better at ui programming

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
than me which is super easy because i'm

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,839
really bad at that

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,880
you can write a better ui element and

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,800
just replace it

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,399
and you just attach your ui element to

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
my audio node

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,079
or if you have an audio note which is

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,240
pretty similar you can just

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,839
attach this ui to another audio node and

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,480
use the same interface so that's really

00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,680
really cool

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,040
or you could just use the audio

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,720
somewhere else like you don't really

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,000
really even need to use the ui

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,760
you can just like program everything

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,279
because this is just a javascript object

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,200
and that's how i'm actually writing the

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,360
tests like making sure that things work

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,720
i don't even have the ui yet i just send

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,639
properties and that's how i make sure

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,279
that it works um

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,959
so this is not too peer-to-peer at all

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,480
this is just normal code that works in

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,079
any other modern browser which is good

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,200
because that means that we can play in

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,959
as many devices as we want so the second

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,079
step is putting the toys in a device

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,000
and we have code that works everywhere

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,480
so we just make a static website

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,120
like something like this and then that's

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,800
it

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,480
that's when it because we actually don't

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,079
need any pretty big stuff here we just

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,199
need to put things in a way that we can

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,639
transmit the data

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,519
and we don't want to reinvent the wheel

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,480
for this so for magnetos available

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,480
we have a website what do we do with

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,360
websites we put them on servers

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,800
so we need a server and the sad thing or

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,639
the good thing is that we cannot build a

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,519
server or a normal browser

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,600
but firefox os apps have super powers

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,000
and the super power we need is the tcp

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,639
socket

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,680
which is what the http protocol or the

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,519
servers

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,959
are built on so what about we bundle

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:16,320
a website in on the web server

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,160
into a firefox os app so that's a zip

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,399
file that we can just like push it

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,920
and so it's offline and we install it on

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,959
the master device which is going to be a

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,079
nexus 4

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,680
which is flash with firefox size and

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,839
that should be it and the good thing is

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,920
that someone had actually written a web

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,560
server so i didn't have to do it myself

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,480
i can just use it and the way you use it

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,519
is pretty like node-like you just

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,079
require that

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,720
then create an instance and you start it

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,120
and this is the port we're using the 80.

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,199
but this web server would accept

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,880
requests but wouldn't reply to them

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,680
because we haven't set up any listener

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,160
or anything

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,160
so we need to respond to the requests

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,399
and the way we do it is to just stop

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,360
an event listener and just request and

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,240
that's it

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,519
and how you process the request it's up

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,680
to you because this server is not

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,560
dictating what you want to do

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,040
but it doesn't even know how to parse

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,040
the

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,480
logic i mean the roots or whatever

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,600
you're sending it so we need to do it

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
ourselves

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,120
so what we are actually wanted to do we

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,199
want to just serve static content

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,959
so that means like if you request a

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,360
directory we are just

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,120
sending you index.html that means if you

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,399
request something that ends with a slash

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,560
this is a directory in like html terms

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,600
and likewise if you request a file you

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,920
need to re

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,440
like serve the contents of that file so

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,720
it's like if that thing doesn't end with

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,120
a slash

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
so that's that's pretty easy and but

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,000
actually before we send anything we need

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,680
to tell the the browser on the other

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,959
side like hey i'm going to send you this

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,199
thing which is this content type

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,519
otherwise you will get weird results

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,040
so we need to find the what what's the

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,560
content type of the thing we're serving

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,320
and i'm using this super easy thing

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,160
which is like i'm using the extension

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,079
so if you are requesting something that

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,600
ends with html i'm just going to say

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,959
this is text html

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,160
like what gpg is image jpg

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,759
this is naive by works so just use the

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,720
simple thing that works

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,920
and for actually serving we just say

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,079
okay this is the headers

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,839
in the response we have from before

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,399
which is the function we just made and

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,839
we just

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,519
choose the utility method from the

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,680
server which is send file

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,800
and actually what this thing is doing is

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,160
it does

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,000
an html http request to the server

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,759
app because this is all javascript as i

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,320
said firefox os is all written with

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,000
javascript

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,440
and once you get the contents it sends

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,920
the response to the other browser it's

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,360
kind of like

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,759
this super hack that actually works

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,880
so for connecting to the server you need

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,079
to find the ip

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,800
and one way of finding the ip is you go

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,839
to the

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,160
phone and go to settings wi-fi

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,279
available networks currently work and

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,959
you tap again

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,639
and you find the ap there is but that's

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,320
kind of like

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,720
but you could actually use the most

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,800
wi-fi monitor with it's another api you

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,040
can only access in firefox os

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,959
so with that um api you can access

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,240
interesting import important information

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,839
that you need to show in the screen so

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,839
you can find the

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,520
uh ip address and the name of the

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,799
network and it's also interesting to see

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,480
the esthetics of the network because

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,199
sometimes it's disconnected or trying to

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,319
connect so

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,000
your thing is not really available yet

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,839
so that's the things that we're going to

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,760
show in the server so when i start the

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,240
server i will just see that thing and i

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,039
can

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,839
like look at that from my other phone

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,559
and just like

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,520
type in the ip address and that's how

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,520
you end up with

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,480
from this ip address to this other phone

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,360
that gets this thing served to it

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,240
but that's cool we have the thing it

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,320
works

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,840
but you know like typing ip addresses is

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,559
not my idea of fun

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,720
like it's like slow like i don't know

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,320
even typing that thing in a computer is

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,240
like you know like numbers and because

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,240
i'm not an english

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,000
native if someone dictates me the

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,559
numbers i cannot really remember so i'm

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,400
like wait

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,840
wait wait can can you just say this

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,559
thing is slower because i can't really

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,160
remember

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,840
so this is like i don't want to be

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,480
typing in addresses

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,280
so there was a way that you could reduce

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,960
this friction

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,440
and the way you use nfc and what nfc

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,200
means

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,640
is near field communication is this

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,919
thing that people don't really know how

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,160
to use for

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,840
and so it lets you transmit small pieces

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,760
of data between devices and what people

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,120
usually use it is to send you contact

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,520
data like

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,880
that's where i want to send to to get my

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,410
phone to touch some other people

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,000
who i don't know phone is like

00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,720
[Music]

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
so the things that nfc enabled devices

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,840
when they get the url

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,440
they navigate to that url and so when

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,880
you send one of those small pieces of

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,840
data you can say this thing i'm sending

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,400
you is a url

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,840
so if you type that phone is going to

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,760
say oh you're sending a url i'm just

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,760
going to open this thing

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,919
and actually firefox source apps can

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,520
control the web nfc so they can actually

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,919
send you things

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,760
so as a well let's add this new feature

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,000
to this web server which is running on

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,080
this

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
phone so this phone is becoming a web

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,880
server that also sends you

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,960
urls when this device touches me

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,080
so we won't need to type and that's

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,559
really cool

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,080
so the support again is this is

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,200
narrowing now like we are

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,880
having support to in nfc in firefights

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,720
android somebody told me windows 1 i

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,240
don't know because i've never used one

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,200
um an iphone 6 plus could

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,600
work but apple are keeping the chip

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,080
themselves for payments so i know apple

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,280
apple

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,799
i don't know um so i think it's

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,280
now the time for the demos and that's

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,840
when i'm going to call my friend

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,919
[Laughter]

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,360
and we're going to try and show you what

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,080
we have right now

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,440
so i guess we need to see the camera

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,799
right now

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,280
um cool cool

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,840
so this is this web server i don't know

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,880
if you can see this thing

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,799
here's the ip address of the server

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,720
there are all the three phones are

00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,559
connected to the network which is

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,240
on my other phone so i have a

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,320
hotspot running here so i didn't need to

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
depend on the wi-fi network here

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,840
and this is the messages because i've

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,159
been trying this thing before and this

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,360
is

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,360
all the things that i'm replying like

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,880
responsing to people so we're going to

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,480
try and see we can

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,080
have this thing working so maybe you

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,400
should show the screen

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,799
show it here yeah and hopefully when i

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,000
bump it he will get the

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,159
you yes you went wow

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,200
so he's getting the the choose he can

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,360
choose and he's going to choose the

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,000
ceremony because this is like

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,159
a ceremony this is like this weird

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,840
instrument from the 50s

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,840
and you can maybe play with it

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,559
and yeah yeah yeah and then i'm going to

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,039
try and do the same thing and praying

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,880
works

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,919
okay cool yesterday in the hotel

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,360
everything broke and i thought it was

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,840
going to be a disaster

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,400
um okay there we go so i'm going to

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,000
control

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,200
a drum machine if it wants to work okay

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,400
cool so this is where the disco party

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,760
starts okay we are going to remove this

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,120
thing so it's more progressive

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,080
and more like step by step okay are you

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,760
ready for this

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,320
yeah let's party are you going to mc as

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,720
well oh no i'm not much of a rapper okay

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:31,650
okay okay there we go

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:39,510
there we go

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:39,510
[Music]

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,520
do you want to go slower i can chase the

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,760
vpm as well

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,760
okay

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,400
if you want to go faster we can go

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,400
faster as well okay maybe faster is

00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
better

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,160
[Music]

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,840
truth be told this is the first time we

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,840
played together so i think

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,360
it's thank you it's really cool

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,360
yesterday essentially this thing kind of

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,200
got confused and it instead of sending

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,480
me music instruments it sent me

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,240
gifts of cats and then i

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,679
installed that thing and this thing and

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,360
also went out

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,720
and nothing worked and i was like giving

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,320
away like

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,440
nothing works so yeah so that was

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,640
it this is the current state and can i

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,720
go back yes thank you um so

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,720
of course this is not done by any means

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,400
i think that something's not working

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,960
well when you connect headphones and it

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,840
kind of goes slower so that's weird

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,120
and i've got like my next step is to be

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,840
able to control

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,799
like the bpm in all the devices using

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,880
web sockets

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,720
so i can slow down everyone at the same

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,400
time and

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,000
i want to do more toys and obviously

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,520
with authoring you can't really go that

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,760
far

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,520
and also i need to implement service

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,039
workers in cash so people can

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,679
actually keep the toys and keep playing

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,360
when i leave with my master device

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,159
and also might be interesting to share

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,840
and store the presets so if

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,840
like the framing you can only change the

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,679
octaves but other instruments might have

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,200
more complex presets so it might be

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,320
interesting to share the good ones with

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,720
people

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,000
and also in the future brian eye doesn't

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,480
really work too well but you

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,039
should be able to like not actually need

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,960
to

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,480
have this fire spot and set everything

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,919
up which i had to do before when you

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,200
were having coffee

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,640
in the future you should be able to do

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,799
this thing automatically with more of

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,039
those peer-to-peer apis

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,640
and maybe we want to also send the input

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,039
events so we record everything and we

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,200
upload it to bandcamp and get rich

00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,960
this isn't that cool and so also

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,640
that thing which is also interesting is

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,240
we should be able to connect

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,600
to the master device automatically

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,000
instead of having to do this manual

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,120
thing

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,360
but right now there's a limitation of

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,880
firefox where you can only set two

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,799
network like one device to another

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,799
device right now instead of

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,919
one device to multiple devices so right

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,200
now it's not working and that's why i

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,120
need to use the hotspot or maybe using

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,799
udp sockets with openstack control and

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,159
sending things to media devices so i

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,960
mean i've got more things like this is

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,720
not the only

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,960
stuff i've got so it would be nice to

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,960
control everything with javascript

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,159
and i don't know i might have more ideas

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,520
and so

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,520
if you want to hack on this or are

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,039
curious whether just talk to me or

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,559
don't talk to me just use bits and

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,919
pieces everything is in github or

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,600
use everything if you want to like if

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,000
you want to be an artist with this i'm

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,480
super happy about that

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,520
all i'm saying in other words is do

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,520
whatever you want

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,120
because this is the web and you should

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,559
be able to do whatever you want no one

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,559
should be telling you what to do what

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,480
not to do and so i'm collecting

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:59,200
resources and things on peer-to-peer

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,370
apis on this repository

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:13,360
and thanks

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:17,120
[Applause]

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,000
couch time um i didn't see any questions

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,120
on twitter

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,840
cool and i'm surprised because my first

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,880
question is

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,799
how can i join the band oh

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,400
you just need a device i can't i just

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,919
need to bump things though

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,520
so i don't know if i'm a good that's

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,559
fine i don't know if you want a banner

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:39,039
everyone is invited okay cool great

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:41,679
now i'm happy uh questions please

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,480
i can't see anyone oh there's a question

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,679
over there

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,679
in the front second row

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,880
so thanks for the inspiring presentation

00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:01,039
it was indeed quite fascinating

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,279
uh i wasn't too impressed yet with your

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,039
setup with all those wires and mixers

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,039
and that kind of stuff

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,720
do you imagine would it be possible to

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,200
somehow

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,440
transmit also the audio data back to the

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,799
master device

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,520
somehow in sync so that that

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,640
you could only use the master device

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,000
audio output

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,919
to get result that could be possible

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,320
using webrtc probably but i had to

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,840
use a hack this is a physical hack right

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,760
now

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,039
yeah in the future i would like to not

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,880
to have all those wires it's really

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,159
inconvenient especially when you travel

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,320
people are like wow yeah it would be

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,520
like kind of like more uh more

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,960
impressive that way but

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,120
i i doubt if if that's kind of

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,480
possible to transmit the data fast

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,000
enough to get it

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,919
we should be able to connect the output

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,640
of the thing to a stream and just say

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,640
what we are to see

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,080
more questions

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,960
maybe someone upstairs no

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:14,720
can't see anyone come on

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,720
no yeah there's a question over there

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,320
could you do um anything in the part of

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,600
the discovery of the other devices

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,240
with that rtc data channels

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,080
or i guess you still you have to have a

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,760
web server or

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,640
i don't understand the question webrtc

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,159
allows you peer-to-peer communication

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,640
but

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:49,279
could you use that instead of the

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,799
the tcp web server on the firefox phone

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,559
you could but you need to establish a

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,520
way to start the communication so the

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,320
server

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,760
it's a natural thing like if i wanted to

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,120
do that thing i would need to find a way

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,360
to

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,720
send the data and parse it and

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,679
everything why not just just a web

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,840
server

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,159
yeah so the good thing is that the way

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,679
if other devices don't support

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:14,640
the whole webrtc thing works

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,640
and not all devices support nfc if you

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,080
do all your stuff you can use an ap

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,440
address

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,559
or you could maybe do

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,279
more than analog modem sounds

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,080
and then the other phones yeah you could

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,399
get it

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,520
yeah but then you don't have time to

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,440
write the music things

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,559
so you have to choose you need to choose

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,559
something yeah okay

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,200
one more

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,720
yay there it is

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,360
oh there we go hi thanks for the

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,559
presentation it was really

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,919
nice and inspiring

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:57,120
really kind so

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,840
if i want to hack on this how can i do

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,399
it do i need a firefox os

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,880
phone for this or you actually don't

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,880
need

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,799
well yeah you need if you want to have

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,159
the server that sends you things but the

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,039
app and all the things

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,000
don't really need anything specific like

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,440
i'm actually developing

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,760
in the browser and i try everything in

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,600
the browser and

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,720
like you can hack on individual things

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,000
that's if you want to have the whole

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,360
thing of having the server running on

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,880
the phone and everything

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,559
but you don't need that if you don't

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:31,039
want to be portable

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,679
okay cool i can see a question right

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,600
there

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,600
so we're going to roll with it

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,159
hello do you think you could do live

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,240
performances with it

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,080
do you think there is enough performance

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,200
in these devices to do

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,559
like multiple sounds and generate this

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,559
in real time so uh do you think there

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,320
is yeah well that's the whole point

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,840
having a way to just go somewhere and

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,559
say like let's go play music

00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,360
and cool if it doesn't crash which right

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,360
now it does a bit

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,320
thanks awesome i guess we're done with

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,159
questions but that was

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,919
absolutely amazing and i hope everyone

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,480
is excited about making music with

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,440
hardware

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,320
i am but i suck at music so i don't know

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,279
if i'm

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,120
okay now i'm in the band so i don't know

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:23,840
how that will work obviously

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,840
