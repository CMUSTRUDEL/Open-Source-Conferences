Title: Sebastián Markbage: Moving JS from Libraries to Polyfills | JSConf.ar 2014

Description: 
	I’ll explain how React is moving towards a minimal API surface area. Instead of providing many framework features, React is trying to utilize patterns, paradigms and JavaScript language features to accomplish the same tasks that other frameworks have dedicated APIs for. Not all environments have these natively. We need to polyfill new an experimental features. How can we safely do that? Is it better to have a non-standard library?
