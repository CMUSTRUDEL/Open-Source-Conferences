I'm Nathan Riley and I live in the san

00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,340
francisco bay area have been for

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,950
all my life pretty much and i work at

00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,970
automatic wordpress com also known as

00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:26,290
and i've been there for about a year i

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,550
came over with the cloud up acquisition

00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:33,040
with ki jaya or ouch and i primarily do

00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,900
javascript over there you know we were

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,280
working on a new editor experience for

00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,540
for making blog posts and they they're

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,110
relying on us to make that experience

00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,510
happen so I've been doing JavaScript for

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,710
at least five years i would say i would

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,070
i would consider myself pretty

00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:53,800
proficient in it primarily all of my

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,790
development work is in javascript or at

00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,280
least something that compiles to

00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:00,640
JavaScript for HTML and CSS which are

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,030
related but it's definitely my my

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,460
primary language so specifically we're

00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:10,509
working on building the new editor

00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:12,670
experience making blog posts and having

00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:15,430
a really nice clean interface for

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,039
including embeds and you know youtube

00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,690
things like that and also bringing over

00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:21,789
some clawed up influences to the editor

00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,560
as well like the drag and dropping of

00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:26,319
files on the web browser and having them

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,979
being included in the post that way well

00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,750
I mean it's touching wordpress com so

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,729
that's like a pretty big chunk of the

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,649
internet right I mean I mean WordPress

00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:38,380
itself is like 20 over twenty percent of

00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:41,289
the internet and wordpress com hold

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,910
holds a good chunk of that as well so

00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:44,800
it's gonna be going into the hands of

00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,630
you know millions of users right out

00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,360
right off the gate so that I mean for me

00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,640
that's nerve-racking but also exciting

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,440
and JavaScript because didn't be around

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,050
for a while web browsers have proved

00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,640
that to us and the web browser is the

00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,800
you know the primary platform of choice

00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,259
these days so that's you know that's

00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,060
javascript is really early option other

00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:05,920
than these new you know compiled two

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,290
languages that you know are ultimately

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,090
just JavaScript in the end

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,220
well it's my third time here in

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,690
beautiful bunny series and I just can't

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,660
get enough of it every time you see mo

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:19,890
says we're coming back in like 20 hour

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,720
flight I'm there this is the most

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,730
beautiful javascript conference I've

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,100
ever been to hands down the designers

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,430
are off the chain I love all the pixel

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:32,280
art and the art work and I mean really

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,190
the production value is incredible live

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,060
streaming in the videos and I mean yeah

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,060
