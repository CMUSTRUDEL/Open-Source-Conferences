usually when you're programming Arduino

00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,570
you use things like C and C++ which is

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,759
what I use all the time now but as an

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,740
introductory thing when you're used to

00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:23,449
using javascript going over to see is

00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,820
kind of annoying they also have

00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:27,050
libraries for Ruby and Python or if

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,320
those are languages that you're more

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,019
comfortable in as well the first thing I

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,059
did was make something light up which is

00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:39,230
the hello world of hardware you make

00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:41,960
something light up so I over a weekend

00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,629
hack pack weekend I made some lights

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,850
happen with JavaScript and it felt super

00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:50,119
powerful I was like this is so neat I

00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,769
have made this happen and then the

00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:54,350
second thing that we did is make this

00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:58,159
sweet Christmas sweater do you guys have

00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,659
the node knockout so every year does

00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:04,430
anyone participated in the node knockout

00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:06,380
I see a hand to applicants ok so the no

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,750
doc out is a worldwide competition that

00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,140
happens once a year the year that we did

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:15,760
it was had 700 teams around the world

00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,620
you get a team of four people and you

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,290
build a product together in a weekend

00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,420
and at the end of the weekend you submit

00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,210
your project and it gets judged by a

00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,159
panel of judges so we built this

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,530
Christmas sweater where you go online

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,720
and you type in something and it shows

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,080
up on the sweater the most useless thing

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,280
ever but we won the Innovation Award

00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,159
which is really awesome we have these

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,900
great boxing shorts that they sent us so

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,409
that was super fun and it was it was a

00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:48,830
great weekend and I learned all types of

00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:51,500
things like so those that thing is

00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:54,380
called an LOL shield which stands for

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,390
lots of leds and in order for have words

00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,850
go across it you have to control each

00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,549
individual LED and pass on a library

00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,830
that has fonts so that you can spell

00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:05,090
words I just always assume that ok you

00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,130
just type the words and then they show

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,530
up but it was interesting and need to

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,610
control each LED and figure out this is

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,299
how we're going to make the word go

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,580
across the screen so there's a lot of

00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:21,620
stuff in the node wats community which

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,950
is really neat there is no bots day this

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,069
is some this is these are

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,290
begins that happen usually in July where

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,390
people from around the world just make

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,860
really new cool stuff with node BOTS and

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,540
share it's not a competition or a

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,220
hackathon people just make cool stuff

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,440
I've seen one really neat thing about

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,890
node wats day is that people of all ages

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,260
participate I see families I see like

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,420
dads and moms go with their kids and

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,980
build neat robots over a weekend and

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,840
demo it it's a really neat experience

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:58,319
for everyone I had great experience at

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,450
jas calm and robots calm the

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,940
original-jay has comp in Florida that

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,640
inspired all these amazing j/s comps

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,140
around the world and robots calm which

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,590
is a relatively new conference which

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,470
just focuses on node baths and chris

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,049
williams who runs Jay esscom built node

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,140
serial port which is the way that our do

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,989
we know talks to your laptop and so he's

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,900
really passionate about node bots so he

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:28,980
put together these sweet activities at

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,970
JS com node copter which I think you're

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:36,150
seeing a demo of later is a way to

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:39,200
control the AR drones from JavaScript

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,870
the AR drones work like a web server

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,750
where you can just send it commands from

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,290
your laptop the coolest thing I've seen

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,370
so far is there's a video online I'm

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,709
going to reference a couple things

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,010
there's videos on my blog I'll share a

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:58,829
link later but the coolest thing I've

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,079
seen is a gentleman you know Dance Dance

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:05,549
Revolution ddr the game where you dance

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:08,819
so you hooked a bit ddr pad to an AR

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:11,190
drone and did Gangnam style as part of a

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,019
hackathon competition which was really

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:18,299
neat so there's lots of cool stuff you

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:20,700
can do node rockets is also really

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,650
interesting they are rockets controlled

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,300
by javascript which is it seems like a

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,460
terrible idea but no one has been her

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:31,409
yet I don't think and node boats are

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,950
literally boats that race in a swimming

00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:35,800
pool that you build over a weekend so

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,720
like

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,340
said you get the parody ar.drone I

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,590
haven't seen a work with other drones on

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,900
their open source and they're really

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,389
awesome you can also make your own

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,370
though I've seen some people make their

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:50,440
own drones that you're neat the parrot

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,879
AR drones aren't cheap so usually I ask

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,610
someone that works at a company that

00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:56,949
owns them if we can borrow them you can

00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:04,000
treat your laptop as a server and make

00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:08,169
them fly the node boats on these are

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,680
made out of soda bottles and you can get

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:16,360
a servo and an Arduino make sure to keep

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,550
everything dry inside on and you can do

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,379
really neat races around the pool you

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,280
can find all this stuff online there's

00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:25,830
videos on node wats calm the node

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:31,539
rockets is what's really interesting

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:34,719
they use PVC piping as a base and a hose

00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:38,740
and soda bottles and they got some

00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:41,819
serious height I saw them going at least

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,289
four stories high it was pretty cool and

00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:47,020
so there's a whole world that I've

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:49,270
discovered is part of jas coffin robots

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:53,289
conf is also introduced they gave away

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:56,380
spark spark cores which are tiny Arduino

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:58,090
'he's that have Wi-Fi enabled so as you

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,389
can see compared to the hand it's really

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,669
small and you can use it to talk to all

00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,199
kinds of things they're designing it to

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,729
use at home they just released one

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,449
that's actually nineteen dollars which

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:12,310
is awesome and you can use it to talk

00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:15,219
two things around your home especially

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:19,090
things that have existing Wi-Fi their

00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:21,580
concept is to make the smart home and if

00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,770
you look at their repository for the

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,930
spark or it's really neat because it's

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,279
completely open source hardware it's

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,529
actually the best open source hardware

00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,000
repository I've ever seen because you

00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:32,860
can get everything from the Eagle files

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,930
to make your own spark or if you have

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,969
the means to produce one of your own

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,590
they're like just make one of your own

00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:41,229
you know you don't have to buy it from

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,270
us so the schematics everything is

00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:45,969
included in their repository which is

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:48,039
pretty awesome so these are some

00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:49,120
projects that people have made this is a

00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:53,139
doorbell

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,580
um that works outside and it sent you an

00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:58,590
email when someone's out your door which

00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:02,790
is pretty cool this is a word clock

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:05,350
which is a really cool looking clock

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:08,710
another thing that I discovered a jay is

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,510
comp is super awesome Sylvia she is

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,550
great if you have not looked her up

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,710
please do if you've not seen any of our

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,800
video she was the keynote last year at

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,030
robots comp her and her dad built some

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,490
really neat things and one thing that

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:26,590
she built is a watercolor so it's a

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,650
watercolor machine where you upload an

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,780
SVG to the machine and it paints it just

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,580
in watercolor so you can just put an

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,580
image and it'll watercolor it matches

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,699
the tone of the image exactly as well

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,770
it's really neat so she was she's super

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:44,080
and smiling because also she's 13 and

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,370
she's done all the stuff online so I got

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,600
to meet her find out what she was

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,889
interested in and that was a really cool

00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,419
experience so then after that there's

00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:55,240
also this show have you seen the show

00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:57,099
it's called control-alt-delete you

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,020
should look it up I don't know if you

00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:03,039
guys can get it here but if you pirate

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,590
things it's a really cool show um not

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,870
that I endorse it so some things past

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,090
yes constable Z's are instructables and

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,190
as you can see these things are becoming

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,130
pretty mainstream they partnered with

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:18,639
home depot and radio shack and other

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,770
really big online institutions to do

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,810
do-it-yourself stuff at home which is

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,699
pretty neat I think it's especially neat

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,979
because it shows how much mainstream

00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:28,900
this stuff is becoming and how

00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:31,539
accessible they're trying to make it for

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,880
everyone you can go on instructables and

00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:39,430
find how to make food or how to make

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:41,020
some really neat stuff and this these

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:44,980
are all light up clothes and different

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:47,950
things like that the suit in the middle

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:50,050
is a Tron suit that I tried to make it

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:53,620
did not work out that great but it looks

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,420
awesome in the picture but but yeah

00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,089
instructables has all kinds of things

00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,260
and there everything is step-by-step so

00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:01,120
if you want to build something in

00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,320
hardware it's really detailed there's a

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,810
support forum if you

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,070
have trouble and hopefully we won't end

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,890
up like me and you can make something a

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,350
little bit better than that I also

00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:15,640
discovered as part of that research

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:18,490
Becky stern she works for Adafruit and

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:23,080
Adafruit is a company that does open

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:27,070
source wearables and they also sell

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:29,080
parts like Arduino they do the there are

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,150
doing is that you can sew into clothes I

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:36,640
think it's the Adafruit flora they do

00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:40,270
now you can also do a conduct conductive

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,040
thread so you can take an Arduino so it

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,020
into your clothes take conductive thread

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,970
and sew in LEDs and different things

00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,430
like that it's really neat and they have

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,140
instructions all over online I worked

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,600
with a 13 year old girl who made a

00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,520
sweatshirt that has directionals on her

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,020
back so that when she rides her bike she

00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,790
can just hit a button in her sleeve and

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,550
she has an arrow on the back of her

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,870
sweatshirt which is pretty cool and they

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,160
have all the instructions for things

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:08,860
like that on Adafruit they make this

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,830
really neat stuff that on the top left

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:15,490
is makeup that's conductive makeup so

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:17,500
these girls put on conductive material

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,810
into makeup put these LEDs on their

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,010
foreheads and it looks awesome I mean if

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,470
you were walking down the street it

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,770
would be really startling but it looks

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:29,500
really neat i think that tie changes

00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,580
color with music a lot of this stuff you

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,220
maybe couldn't wear to work every day

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,900
but it's really neat those videos online

00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,750
and like I said they're on my blog as

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,030
well this is a microphone holder that

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,740
changes color and that's a sweet bike

00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,080
helmet and no one can miss you if you're

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,910
wearing that bike helmet so these are

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,130
all the things that I've been learning

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,850
about in the past couple years the world

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:56,050
is the world of open source wearables

00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,270
and open source things have been really

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,000
accessible people are also super nice

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,020
the first couple hackathons I went to I

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,180
was just like I don't know what I'm

00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,920
doing someone next to me was super

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,150
helpful and now when I'm in a hackathon

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,280
someone's like I don't know what I'm

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,690
doing I'm like oh let me show you it's

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,220
pretty it's an awesome world I'm sure

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,540
you've had the same experience though I

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,220
had the same experience in the

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,329
JavaScript world it translates really

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,759
well to node by

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:22,089
it's the same attitude of let's all

00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,589
learn together so this is the first

00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:26,309
thing I mean it's really ugly it's a

00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:28,720
Christmas ornament with a light in it I

00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:30,689
even tried to like put other stuff with

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,989
it to make it look a little bit better

00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:37,569
but I just figured hey I want to make

00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:39,790
something that looks nice and is a

00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:41,019
wearable and I want to make it of my own

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,259
so I did that and that's going to be a

00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:47,619
while actually took me a while and this

00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:50,559
changed color based on your twitter

00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:51,850
status so if your twitter status and

00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,269
that's on my github if your twitter

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:58,089
status is sad it changes to blue and

00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:59,980
things like that and so this is the

00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:02,199
first design of it and this is the

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,989
second design of it now it looks little

00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:06,519
better and these cat these cad files are

00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:11,019
online as well if you want a laser cut

00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:13,540
flower or on or the I guess the body and

00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:15,069
the necklace you can do that but it

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,829
changes color based on your Twitter feed

00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:21,459
so in order to go from really ugly

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:23,049
jewelry to this I found some people on

00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:24,970
etsy and I was like I need to design

00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:28,480
something can you help me they're like

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:31,179
okay and I got designs from them and I

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,850
worked with them to collaborate on

00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:37,869
something like this and now we're here

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:39,759
and this inside a Julie bot lives a web

00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:43,059
server that is four millimeters by four

00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:47,019
millimeters which is crazy so small um

00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:49,600
and all the things that I learned from

00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,730
nodebots translates here all the

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,100
bluetooth module zywert in a node bas

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,350
translates to this tiny bluetooth module

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,759
that we're working with now and some of

00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,589
them some of the components i'm using

00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,509
are the same like the same motor that

00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:03,489
you use and you get from Adafruit is

00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,799
what we're using and the same type of

00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:07,720
lipo batteries is what we're using so

00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,790
all of this stuff has translated really

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,790
well to doing this full time now and

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:15,819
we're part of a highway 1 accelerator in

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,410
San Francisco and they've been really

00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:19,329
helpful but I wouldn't be able to do it

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,540
at all if it weren't for no advice in

00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:26,889
general so if you want to get started

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:28,480
with this I want to say it's easy right

00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,740
that sounds like it might not be easy

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,830
but it is

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,140
um feel free to reach out on my blog or

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,630
Twitter or anything this is what you

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:41,560
need you need an arduino uno and you

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:44,620
need an LED and if you go to the Johnny

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,200
Five repository and just look in the LED

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,580
library it's really you can just copy

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,710
and paste some code to get it working

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,180
for the first time and once you get that

00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,650
working for the first time you have that

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,600
blinking light in front of you with such

00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,170
an empowering experience you feel like a

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,050
god you're like I have made this happen

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,550
so I highly recommend and I hope that

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,050
some of the stuff you see today inspires

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:09,060
you to get started and feel free to

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,060
