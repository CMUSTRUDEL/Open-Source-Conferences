my name is Nick Elizabeth wanta and i

00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:20,560
work at twitter for the visual insights

00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:22,539
team so we do data visualization focused

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,439
mainly on public tasting events i leave

00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:29,169
the interactivity telecom project and

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,750
yeah so i was born in argentina i study

00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:34,030
in argentina until I was like about 23

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,539
24 years old and then I moved to France

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,579
I worked there for about three years for

00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:42,100
a French search engine company and then

00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,750
I moved over to the u.s. to work for

00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,880
Twitter

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,550
currently I'm working I've been working

00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,640
with Twitter like for more than two and

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:54,140
a half years

00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:57,140
yeah April 2415 will be three years so

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,940
my talk was about from data journalism

00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,120
to data illustration so it's like how to

00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,129
visualize data using javascript and how

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,300
we do that at Twitter so it's like the

00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,920
process of like building data

00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,830
visualisations for different verticals

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,930
so we build data resulting to produce

00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,300
government TV and sports and other

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,180
verticals it's like how we build those

00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,970
visualizations yeah so i've been using

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,700
web standard sims i graduated basically

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:26,270
so for more than seven or eight years

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,220
now mostly using standards for graphics

00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:31,160
so i am very interested in graphics

00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:34,220
technologies in general so it's like 2d

00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,289
canvas SVG and WebGL are the main three

00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,840
main graphic standards and i'm using

00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:40,759
those to create data to those agents to

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,830
give you some kind of data points like

00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,970
there are a billion tweets every two

00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:49,399
days so it is a huge challenge to try to

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,500
visualize that and also you know all the

00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,840
important features of our platform that

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,100
we're global for real time we're

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,650
conversational so there are a lot of

00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,759
different aspects that presenter of

00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,759
challenges to visualize data

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,030
yeah around public facing events for me

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,370
so for our team right so it's like the

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,220
Oscars it's like a huge event there are

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,960
a lots of tweets you know state of the

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,520
union address there's a lot of

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,890
conversation around what the president

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,840
says and a lot of things like that so

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,520
yeah I think that it's already something

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,050
that could be in the future like if you

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,790
had a platform that's already real-time

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,380
and you know how people are using

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,750
Twitter they're using it in very

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,100
different ways and so it's it's

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,260
interesting to try to know more about

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,570
the user base and how they're using it

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,130
like we're providing them a platform and

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,770
they're building something on top of

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,250
that right so it's I can really tell how

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:47,880
it will be 10 years from now this

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:51,360
conference is amazing the caliber of the

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,860
speakers like here are great we have

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,170
Brendan Eich who's like the creator of

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,390
JavaScript we will be talking today so

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,880
that's like that doesn't get better than

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,730
that right and the community is huge

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,160
it's like I've been here in 2012 it was

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,160
about 200 people and now it's like three

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,440
times more that three times 3x that so

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,000
it's it's really big it's getting bigger

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,340
and yeah I've been talking to a lot of

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,730
different people from Buenos Aires from

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,010
La Plata and there

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,870
like there's a huge kind of movement

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,440
around like technology in general in

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,440
