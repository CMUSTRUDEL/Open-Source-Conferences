my name is andreas scholl I live in

00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,130
California and a mozilla chief

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,109
technology officer

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,570
I'm responsible for missoula's

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,239
technology roadmap and overall all the

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,570
technologies that we do at Mozilla

00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:29,099
missoula is the place that really gave

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,009
birth to javascript through been denied

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,110
or former CTO who invented a JavaScript

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,010
language if you look at the history of

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,329
JavaScript over the last many years it's

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,540
still the case that essentially with

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,579
every year the new tools and the new

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,949
technology is available in JavaScript

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,839
and through JavaScript are accelerating

00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:50,820
there's more more things we can do with

00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:52,439
JavaScript and we are also seeing a very

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,360
healthy addition of new language

00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,519
features sue sanitization and we're very

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,580
excited about that I've not been in more

00:00:56,519 --> 00:01:01,890
size before so this is actually my first

00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,140
time en w'en Osiris and also in

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,049
Argentina I've traveled to pretty much

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,079
every part of Latin America except

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,600
Argentina because missoula has been

00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,689
launching since last year Firefox OS all

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,610
over Latin America and in Argentina is

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,890
the last place where we launch Firefox

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,530
OS so I was didn't have the opportunity

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,179
so far to come here but I'm very happy

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,369
that I finally had the chance to do so

00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:28,859
yesterday I had for the first time the

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,200
opportunity to eat steak here in

00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:34,380
Argentina so I had steak in Brazil and

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,789
here in Argentina but I only tried one

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,590
restaurant so I think I have to try a

00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:41,579
couple more before I can decide where it

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,950
is better I talked here about j2me jas

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,439
which is a java virtual machine written

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,689
in JavaScript we're using this Java VM

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,729
to run feature phone applications on

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,709
firefox OS I think it's great I have

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,899
attended quite a few JS comps in the

00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,579
past before even though it's the first

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,170
time for me in Argentina but it's really

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,240
great there's a lot of people and a lot

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,219
of very interesting talks and I'm

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,709
particularly excited that I get to give

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,149
a keynote together with Brendan so that

00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,770
that's a very special occasion we have

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,240
never done that before that we are

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,660
basically back-to-back keynotes between

00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,660
