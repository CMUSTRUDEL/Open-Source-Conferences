hi my name is Alvaro i am from other way

00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:19,540
originally but bimbo I mean living

00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,850
abroad since seven years first in China

00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:25,029
for three years building a big website

00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,430
like a big dating site for Germany from

00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:29,919
there I moved to Switzerland since four

00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,619
years i'm living there and i work for

00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:34,390
RabbitMQ i wrote the book about RabbitMQ

00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:37,750
and i also work for the core team of

00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:42,940
rabid rabid EMU is messaging and queuing

00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:45,100
server the idea is that you can delay

00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,530
processing of tasks for example in your

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,140
in your website like just a canonical

00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,820
example like your images instead of

00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,460
researching them while the user is

00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,739
waiting you can just kill them and send

00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,350
a message to a worker that could be

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:02,620
written in no door closure java whatever

00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,720
and then do the oldest processing in the

00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:08,590
background to save resources on the

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,520
front ends so rabbitmq is actually

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,950
written in ireland but is implements a

00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,650
protocol called n QP advanced message in

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,720
queue in protocol which has clients in

00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:23,979
many languages for for example

00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:27,220
javascript java and PHP closure python

00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:29,020
ruby and so on so users can actually

00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,450
benefit a lot from this because they can

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,780
have the front ends in node and today's

00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,790
like very fashion to have micro services

00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,130
and you can have your own micro service

00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:42,250
like for resizing images in java let's

00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,840
say one for sending emails in know Jas

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,450
and you can mix and match all these

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,880
languages very easily thanks to RabbitMQ

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,549
and entropy the talk was about doing

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,630
replication with RabbitMQ so i gave like

00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:57,670
a brief intro of how n QP works and then

00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,770
jumped into how to do replication would

00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,680
rabbit with the tools provided by by the

00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:06,590
server i actually my first time here was

00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,030
this november for a different conference

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,860
and this is my second time we went

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,430
inside effectively so it's very

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:17,239
interesting yes it's quite a like amount

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:21,440
of video that took a more bit on inside

00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:23,840
I think in the area of rabbit for

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,989
example the main thing today might be

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,549
the micro services like more and more

00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:31,370
architectures are moving to the cloud

00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:33,080
and to have this very small micro

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,000
services that you can deploy for example

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,819
with doctor or using cloud foundry or

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,790
this kind of tools and rabbitmq will

00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:42,760
become like a core part they're 2 to do

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:45,980
all this message in synchronization

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,840
moving data around the time I travel a

00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,090
lot actually and go to many conferences

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,360
and I'm really really surprised by the

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:56,090
venue by all the the billboards

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,860
announcing how to get here I mean she's

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,620
just those small details that make the

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,470
conference a better experience for for

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,680
users and big tops are a great they have

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:08,480
a great selection of speakers I mean the

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,540
creator of javascript is here so what

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,190
else to ask and the location is wait so

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,190
