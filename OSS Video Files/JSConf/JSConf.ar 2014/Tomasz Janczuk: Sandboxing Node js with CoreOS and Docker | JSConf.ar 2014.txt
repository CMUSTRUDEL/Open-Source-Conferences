my name is Thomas on troop I'm working

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,010
40 I'm currently living in Seattle but

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,110
I'm

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,000
originally from Poland I'm focusing on

00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,290
back-end systems mostly and for the past

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,830
few years I've been working a lot with

00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:28,260
no Jas so I spent a lot of time working

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,489
on cloud computing software for

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,739
microsoft and HP for my last few years

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,590
of Microsoft I we need to signal jas

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,300
into the Microsoft ecosystem after I

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,460
left Microsoft I stayed with no Jas and

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,340
I continue that work with 0 of 0 right

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,610
now I talk was about sandboxing know Jas

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,720
code which is a topic relevant for

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,449
anyone who's building a multi-tenant

00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,760
system that executes custom code on

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,650
users we have I think there are few

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,030
interesting trends in technology over

00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,790
the past couple of years and you are

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,030
only going to see more of it one is the

00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,370
entire software landscape getting more

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,890
polyglot before using more languages and

00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,049
more technologies over time also the

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,790
barrier to entry is getting smaller and

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,320
smaller one thing I know to one

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,970
interesting thing I noticed he not zero

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,159
is how many external systems we are

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,700
using to deliver our service it's about

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,020
50 external components so software

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,490
development going forward I think will

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,800
be mostly about putting together

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,560
existing building blocks and gluing them

00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,170
together rather than huge infrastructure

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,630
investments section my second time in

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,120
Buenos Aires I've into a month ago now I

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,060
love this place is very it reminds me of

00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,530
my home country of Poland study similar

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,020
in many respects of course this is a

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,420
different hemisphere so for me

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,240
personally coming from snowy Seattle

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,660
right now it's a nice change I've always

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,640
liked like Jess conferences they're just

00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,380
different from from all the other

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,210
conferences I've been to I mean at three

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,730
J's conferences in the reigning in the

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,590
US and here in Venice iris and there is

00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,650
a common theme theme running through all

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,120
of them people are just coming to learn

00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,120
