my name is Alex Sexton i just presented

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,610
on building your own component library

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,210
I'm from Austin Texas and I am an

00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,540
engineered stripe that payments company

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,680
a lot of my job focuses around

00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,410
JavaScript development and front-end

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,750
development but I'm also very active in

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,730
the open source community which is where

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,590
I really got into JavaScript I helped

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,440
with the jQuery foundation and the dojo

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,480
foundation and I really enjoy open

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,789
source in general I'm really excited

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,949
about where the web is going and where

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,190
javascript is going definitely a

00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:53,879
ubiquitous language that that people are

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,649
still coming around to but is is really

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,800
I mean they don't really have a choice

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,780
either way because of its ubiquity but I

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,850
think it will really stand up to the

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,880
test of time with things like azum and

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:11,380
things that will really help push the

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,760
JavaScript performance view into

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,030
competition with things like native

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,180
which I think it already can do but in

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:23,810
the future should be the web winning

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:29,180
again case I've really enjoyed Buenos

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:33,229
Aires so far I've had from Texas and so

00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:35,479
the meat situation is correct here and

00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:37,160
I've enjoyed all the food very much so

00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,300
far but also feels like a very friendly

00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,460
city I visit cities often I feel like an

00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,790
outsider and I definitely feel welcome

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,890
and comfortable walking through the

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,250
streets here and that's something that

00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:55,660
that not every city can say she has comp

00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:58,280
Argentina is definitely one of the best

00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,220
JavaScript conferences but I think I've

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,229
been to quite a few j/s comps in

00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,180
particular and this is definitely up

00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:09,110
there with the best of them the food and

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,840
the projectors are crazy Guillermo is

00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,110
crazy I really really have been having a

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,110
