California where I live and I am the

00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:25,779

00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:28,869
and helped found mils of org in 1998 and

00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:32,010
I had a long run with Mozilla helping

00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:35,020
launch Firefox future of JavaScript is

00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:37,480
it's still being used more and more it's

00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,120
being adopted by more programmers being

00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,950
used in more programming domains it was

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,929
always in the browser because it got out

00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,329
first when I was at Netscape before

00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:49,510

00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:51,670
thing the one and then it got into the

00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,679
server side several times but the one

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,640
that really succeeded was node.js

00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,199
