I'm Nikolai bachinsky I'm from Bulgaria

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:22,720
and I work as a meta engineer at

00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:25,480
automatic we make wordpress com our

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,510
company has been investing more and more

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,820
in JavaScript a lot of our new projects

00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:35,350
are our single page applications using

00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:39,699
our REST API also last year we acquired

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:42,250
cloud up and share more the one of the

00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:45,879
organizers of the conference actually

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:48,010
works with us I've been working with a

00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:52,780
lot of single page applications lately

00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:55,269
and honestly I have no idea if this

00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,690
would if this is going to be the future

00:00:55,269 --> 00:01:01,199
in the in the mid to long-term but

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:05,470
actually it's a pretty good way to

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,770
develop responsive and just engaging

00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:12,400
applications now i'm really glad i was

00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:14,890
able to come here because i have a

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,439
feeling that people in in Argentina are

00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,020
are very similar to people in Bulgaria

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,289
in many many ways so I've been wanting

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:26,350
to visit for some time and I still

00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:29,740
haven't seen much from the from the OCD

00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:32,159
but ty will walk around on on Sunday and

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,990
Monday I've just blocked two days and

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,689
I'm really impressed with the conference

00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,969
both both the speakers and in general

00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:43,509
the organization has been great and

00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:45,850
everybody has been incredibly nice which

00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:50,100
I guess is something really common in

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:53,259
the JavaScript community these days I

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,950
think that technologies is another thing

00:01:53,259 --> 00:02:00,219
which is another area where about Gary a

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:03,450
similar to Argentina we have a lot of IT

00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,450
specialist there and

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,759
and it is growing really rapidly I can

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:14,970
see a lot of companies opening offices

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:17,700
and and especially with with a lot more

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,980
companies working remotely I see a lot

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,340
more friend friends of mine just staying

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,250
in Bulgaria instead of going to Western

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,510
Europe board or the US and this way it

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,250
is both good for for their growth and it

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,950
is really great for the country because

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,120
many many people from abroad get to

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:41,160
visit and in and all of those developers

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,670
get to spend their money in Bulgaria

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,670
