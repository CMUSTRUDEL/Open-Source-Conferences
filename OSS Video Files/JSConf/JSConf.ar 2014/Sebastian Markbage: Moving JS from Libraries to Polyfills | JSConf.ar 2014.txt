so my name is Sebastian mark page I live

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,180
in San Francisco

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:24,610
for facebook on the reactor core team

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:29,079
here in Buenos Aires I really like the

00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:33,040
city weather is beautiful beautiful city

00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:40,300
looks like a combination of every other

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:44,230
city like Tokyo Paris London modern New

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:47,350
York yeah I went to the cemetery just

00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:49,869
because I had to see that it's pretty

00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:54,510
cool place spooky right around the

00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:58,839
corner from here so my talk was about

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:02,409
how we a dog polyfills as a way to adopt

00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:04,960
new language features before these

00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:08,170
standards even finalized before it's

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,130
implemented in browsers so that we as a

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,869
community can unify on a single set of

00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:19,020
tools instead of with diverging

00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:19,020
libraries I work on the

00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:27,070
CC 39 standards committee that specifies

00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:31,299
what the next version of the JavaScript

00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,130
will look like and as part of that work

00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,689
I'm really interested in getting

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,960
adoption as soon as possible because

00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:42,069
that helps us at Facebook but also in

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:45,310
our open source community in 10 years I

00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:46,929
think that JavaScript will be going in

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,299
is stronger I think that we will

00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:52,770
actually have shifted patterns lot we

00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:56,289
will no longer be using as much

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,140
object-oriented styles will probably use

00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:01,829
the less mutation we will move towards

00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,750
more of a functional style paradigm and

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,300
we will start dropping

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,630
features from the language that people

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,870
will no longer use as they're adopting

00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:17,210
new patterns this conference is really

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,280
it's really nice it's really big it's

00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:24,950
one of the biggest J's comp events out

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,170
there and really happy to be here the

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,480
camera has really gone all out and

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,660
