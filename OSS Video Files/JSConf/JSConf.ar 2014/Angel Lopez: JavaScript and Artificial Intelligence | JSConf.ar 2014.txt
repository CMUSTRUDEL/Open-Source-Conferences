hello my name is angel angel lopez I am

00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:28,220
developer hard I developer for more than

00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:32,269
30 years I draw programs in Java C sharp

00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:34,250
COBOL and now in JavaScript my talk was

00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:37,250
about Chavez keep an artificial

00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:41,870
intelligence i am from buenos aires

00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:44,350
argentina yes the idea was to present

00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:48,159
sang algorithms and perspective about

00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:51,129
javascript on artificial intelligence

00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:57,860
artificial intelligence is a broad term

00:00:51,129 --> 00:01:01,000
is bad I present some demos using

00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,549
genetic algorithms neural networks an

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,990
evolutionary problems in JavaScript for

00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:12,430
browser and fro for nausea yes why

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:15,250
javascript an artificial intelligence

00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,439
because javascript is everywhere

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:21,710
artificial intelligence is racing again

00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:24,380
with the big data with the internet of

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:27,320
things with a lot of widget that are

00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,469
connected I interconnected we need more

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,770
knowledge representation we need more

00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:36,140
frame language we need more expert

00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:40,909
systems for example for home automation

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:44,450
are reacting to sensors that is I think

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:47,689
that JavaScript and evil intentions is a

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:51,409
good mix for this year's or she is calm

00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:57,319
is great is the second she has comes in

00:01:51,409 --> 00:02:01,719
a shin Tina I think that it's one of the

00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:04,340
best conference we have here each year

00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:07,490
why I started which our gift for the

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:13,360
browser but some years ago I started to

00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:17,290
wrote for noche es noche es is really a

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,630
revival of JavaScript and you can write

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:24,830
food programs in osha yes for the server

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:27,580
you can still write JavaScript for

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,580
