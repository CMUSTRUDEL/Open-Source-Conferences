hi I'm Juan I'm from Buenos Aires Xena

00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,340
this here my whole life and I'm a

00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,710
JavaScript developer I've been working

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:28,369
with well for the last 10 years probably

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:31,100
and I've recently joined yahoo a year

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:34,910
ago I've been part of the why I

00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,640
community for a long time and I was

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,379
grateful to join the team there I'm kind

00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,180
of sad to see it go in the last couple

00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:43,610
of months but we're working on some new

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:46,550
siding projects justices from a DSS I

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:50,000
presented today under stuff around es6

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:53,089
and no tears applications ok so I'm am

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,150
pure JavaScript developer I actually

00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:59,680
started doing some other stuff like PHP

00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:03,530
and working with games but I eventually

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:08,120
specialized a lot in JavaScript I do

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:11,960
mostly big web big front end

00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:15,700
applications and no Jas and I've slowly

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:19,880
become some sort of you know lawyer on

00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:22,850
specifications and I'm hoping to get

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,240
involved with 279 and all the standards

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:29,120
process Jasper well i think i think we

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,570
stuck up a couple of you know hints at

00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,000
where we're going with the web already

00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,250
with such as in mr. dibbs presentation i

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,200
think we're going to see even more and

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:44,510
more intuition with childhood anywhere I

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,630
mean there was is talk like a stock

00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:51,140
called the birth and death of java

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,940
script was written in which a guy told

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,480
the history of javascript and the future

00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:58,400
of it in some sort of a fictional way

00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,740
but eventually in this fiction just keep

00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,370
ended up everywhere even in processors

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:06,860
and i think it's kind of a joke but

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:10,009
we're seeing that javascript is kind of

00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,970
permeating everywhere from hardware to

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:15,660
robots to

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:18,930
built our reality so I think the web

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,480
will keep being this thing that connects

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,870
us all and at the core of it will be the

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,780
web platform things that we working on

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,160
today my talk was about

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,680
internationalization and you know it's

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,780
one of the core things in the web that

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,520
you don't think about you all the time

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,260
you're used to dealing with one or two

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,330
languages in our case like Spanish in

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,160
English but the web actually reach these

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:48,660
people in Africa in the east in our

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,130
countries that I speak Arabic countries

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,290
speak Chinese or Japanese and dealing

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,270
with language it could be kind of

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,450
complicated so we're working on things

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:03,360
that try to simplify I really happened

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,790
to be here being a you know one of the

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,920
things that you think oh maybe I could

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:11,130
give a talk or not but I'm really

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,860
impressed and I'm really happy to see a

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,680
really great audience that come here to

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,940
learn with a an open mind and I think

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,680
that's something you don't see every day

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,680
