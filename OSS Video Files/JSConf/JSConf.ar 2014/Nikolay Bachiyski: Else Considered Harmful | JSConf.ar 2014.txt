Title: Nikolay Bachiyski: Else Considered Harmful | JSConf.ar 2014
Publication date: 2015-05-10
Playlist: JSConf.ar 2014
Description: 
	The "if else" logic is not entirely intuitive for our minds. We'll explore some alternatives that would lead to the same results but without using the more traditional logic sintax most of us are used to. We'll also see how we can benefit from reducing the complexity of our code in favour of readability, making it say what we really mean instead of having to translate all of our thoughts into a series of "if else" statements.

hey everybody um I was

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,880
who it with an old joke so our

00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,360
programmer is about to leave to the

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,210
grocery stores and and her husband asks

00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,869
her honey can you please buy some bread

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:35,640
and if there are any eggs

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:38,520
could you please buy a dozen and ash and

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,370
she goes to the store she comes back and

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,030
you can imagine he his or his surprise

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:50,610
when she brings back a dozen loaves of

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:54,059
bread so we obviously have a have a

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:58,949
problem here right so what if the

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:01,920
problem is in the earth right if he if

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:04,339
he didn't give her any choice there

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,330
wouldn't have been any any trouble right

00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:12,810
so unfortunately computers are really

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,690
bad at at working without if a closest

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,909
or without branching in general without

00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,359
switch without ternary operators and

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:29,280
stuff like this because they will be

00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:33,270
able to do only one thing this is not

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:37,590
really good right and culturally people

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,329
we also really like choice because we

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,320
currently further otherwise without

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:46,829
choice right we we are we really needed

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,429
so we will have to look at the problem

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:55,710
somewhere else and where else would will

00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:59,189
be would be the problem people talk

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:02,999
about if a lot but people rarely talk

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:09,060
about else and you can see that in in

00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:12,210
English books the word if he is actually

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:16,560
seen more than 10 times more than than

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:22,050
the word else which is a lot so people

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:27,390
like if a lot more than else and however

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:29,290
in in computer programs the world the

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,459
word if is actually seen on

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,379
or only four times more than else which

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:37,780
is which means the team computer

00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:42,040
programs we have two point five times

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:44,049
more else clauses then if clauses why is

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,379
there such a such a big difference

00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:50,170
between natural language and code

00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:52,239
because we're kind of supposed to eat to

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:57,220
express with code war what we want to

00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:01,930
say with natural language right and I'll

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:05,040
try to to give you a few reasons but but

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,810
first let us try to track a typical

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:14,530
logic statement with ifs and else's

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:16,900
right we we have on if with condition

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,480
one and this piece of code will will be

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:23,829
executed if condition number one is true

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,620
right then this piece of code will will

00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:29,980
be executed if if both conditions one

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:33,819
and two are true right then we go to

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:37,739
announce where we have to change our

00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:40,510
context in in in in the sense that

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,840
condition number two now now he has to

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:48,459
be false when when we are trying to read

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,620
the code and and this help and the same

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:55,720
thing happens for the rest of the

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:58,510
Earth's closest we have to always do a

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:03,340
context which every time we are we are

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:05,319
reading an else and historically context

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:10,359
switches has been really hard both for

00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:14,949
computers and for people doing doing of

00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:17,829
our everyday jobs so before we continue

00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:19,720
on letter let us look at war what would

00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:23,590
a statement containing only only if

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:27,360
clauses would look like without any

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:30,009
analysis we will have to remember that

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,720
this code will basic execute it only

00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,699
when only when the first connect

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,470
condition is true this code will be

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,380
executed when both the first and the

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,539
second conditions are true the next

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,580
piece of code will be well when all of

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,039
the first three conditions are true

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,159
and finally the last piece of code will

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:51,129
be executed only the only the only way

00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:52,750
when all four conditions are true so we

00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:55,500
don't do any context which is we just

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:59,259
we're just adding more more context and

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:03,969
in general for four people and

00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:07,599
historically change is bad people never

00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:09,909
never like change but people actually

00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:12,909
like building stuff and they like adding

00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:15,879
more and more stuff nobody likes my

00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:22,810
grating laptops but everybody likes new

00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:25,330
new laptops right and so now I will out

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:28,870
take another try at explaining why there

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,879
are so many more else Clause is in

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,300
programming compared to in in natural

00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:38,319
language and I think the reason is that

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:43,509
else clauses help us help us explain a

00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:47,139
much more complicated logic and and we

00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:50,319
use a more complex logic a lot more when

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:53,349
when we talk to computers then when when

00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,750
we talk to people because computers are

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:59,110
a lot better at at understanding logic

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:04,409
right and unfortunately people are not

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,409
at all great at at understanding logic

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,759
we were just too lazy we are too bored

00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:12,879
too too easily

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,990
and people also fall really easy for our

00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:20,770
logical fallacies but I don't know how

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:23,440
many times have you tried to trace an

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,779
algorithm you wrote and it is always

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,250
incredibly annoying to to keep all of

00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:33,190
the state of in our minds and and is

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:36,180
because people are just inherently not

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:43,690
great at following state just ask the

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:49,270
reality guys however people are really

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:52,149
great at at recognizing patterns I'm

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:55,390
pretty sure you can all read this even

00:06:52,149 --> 00:07:00,070
though it is not any meaningful

00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:04,510
texts right just people are really good

00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:07,270
at for example as you can see they're

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,730
really good at recognizing text even

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,950
though all of the letters in the middle

00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,760
have been scrambled there are also

00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:19,750
really good at recognizing at

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:23,560
recognizing faces immediately I'm always

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,780
amazed how border control officers let

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,270
me in and out of countries really

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:32,920
quickly even though in my passport my

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:35,650
photo looks like this but but it usually

00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,960
takes them like half a second to make

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:41,230
sure and to know that I'm just the same

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,600
person and usually it takes solver

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,640
software because they they now have

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,180
those small cameras it takes the

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,770
software usually a few seconds at least

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:55,150
people are are also really good at

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:57,970
recognizing sounds if you know a song

00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,000
usually you you can recognize it just

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:05,920
from a--from a few beats and usually it

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,320
takes it takes some like 15 second

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:15,570
excerpt right so in all of sense we are

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,570
even a lot better than computers

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:23,200
recognizing various patterns and

00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:26,590
Sciences has totally confirmed that our

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,610
brain is basically a huge and amazing

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:33,520
and really fast

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,200
pattern recognition machine actually

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,020
there have been some studies showing

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,530
that that our brain works were works

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,150
really like recursive probabilistic

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:47,160
refractor which actually science is

00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,160
trying to use for for recognizing faces

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:56,080
so from Modi's week we can draw a pretty

00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:00,100
simple rule that if in our programs we

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,010
use more patterns and less else clauses

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,890
it will be much easier and it will take

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,350
a lot less time for the person who reads

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,420
them to understand what is what is going

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,390
on

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,330
and by patterns I certainly not

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:18,960
necessarily mean design patterns but

00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:23,970
from the Ganga for book if you're fans

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:28,170
of those in in my remaining time I would

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:31,800
try to show you a few examples of tricks

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:35,700
about how you can eliminate else clauses

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,380
from your progress the the first one

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:42,990
which is probably the most common and

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:46,310
easiest is is to emphasize the essential

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:49,740
part toward or the main flow of our code

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:54,420
here is a really typical example where

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:57,150
we if some data is is valid we do we we

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,880
do something with it and it's and if

00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:04,080
it's not we return false right or no

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:06,600
sorry I'm sure everybody has has written

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:11,280
a lot of code for it for situations like

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:16,470
this and see we can the essential part

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:19,200
of the code is is now in pink and this

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,290
way we actually process the data the

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,810
rest is like there is a really neat term

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,120
called accidental complexity which is

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,830
all of the stuff we need to write all of

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,100
the plumbing we need to put so that our

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:35,280
our programs work the way we intended

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:38,160
them and here is a very quick way to

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,080
make sure that that our essential come

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,970
complexity the important part of the

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:48,780
code is emphasized if we if we first

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:51,510
bail if there are any any errors we can

00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,490
achieve a few things first all of our

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,730
essential code can be can be together

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:59,100
also it will not be indented some

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,070
somewhere further in in our program so

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,680
that we know if if something is is in

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,510
the mainland indentation level it is

00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,440
probably something important and not

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:17,040
just a error reporting code or error

00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:19,860
checking code the other another trick to

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,939
eliminate health clauses is to use

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,539
polymorphism

00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:27,309
actually you used to think that that

00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:30,999
polymorphism was a multi-headed master

00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:36,479
from the Greek mythology but it turned

00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:41,229
out that it is it is the method of of

00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:46,479
being able to use the same logic for for

00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:48,429
a data with different types and I'll

00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:50,769
give you another example here I'm sure

00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:53,709
everybody has done something like this

00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:56,379
we have to render a field or or whatever

00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:58,720
object and this field can be can be in

00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:01,539
different types like in our case if it's

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,789
a text we render an input if it's a if

00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:06,519
it's a number we we have our special

00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:09,279
component if it's a text area where we

00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:15,399
render a text area or we throw some some

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:17,889
exception so if if our goal is to

00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:22,359
eliminate else clauses here it'll be

00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:24,909
pretty hard and we can go back to

00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:27,159
polymorphism which to remind you it is

00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:30,339
to find a piece of code which can work

00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:33,189
somehow with with any type and the

00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:35,859
common pattern here is that for each

00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:40,179
type we have a specific component we

00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:42,279
just render and free for example we

00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:45,159
instead of keeping all of our structure

00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:49,409
in if clauses we can keep it in an

00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:52,779
object and we can use the type as a key

00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:55,029
I'm sure all of you have have done this

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:57,069
all a lot of times it is not rocket

00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:00,159
rocket science and I see a lot of people

00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:02,499
actually do it but it's important to

00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,159
remember those tricks when when we have

00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:08,049
a bigger application or or we have a

00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:12,179
really complicated to expression and we

00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:18,159
wanna end you want to eliminate this one

00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:21,039
bye-bye so if you are into into

00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,869
classical P books and stuff there are

00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,970
two things which can help you with using

00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:27,429
polymorphism and give you a lot of

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,629
background on this subject one of them

00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:33,519
is the classic strategy design pattern

00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:35,800
you can check out gank of the for book

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,570
if if you are

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,130
before just please take it with a huge

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:44,110
grain of salt the other classic thing

00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:46,570
which can help you with this is the

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:49,209
refactoring book by Martin flower and

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,120
one of the refactoring is there is code

00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:54,399
replace conditional with with

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,690
polymorphism there are a ton of ideas

00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:03,579
there about how to do that so people

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:06,339
really love up patterns and actually

00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:10,360
they will often see patterns where none

00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:12,870
where no patterns actually exist for

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,459
examples for example there is

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:19,089
experiments showing that if you start

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:21,700
showing people random dots when when

00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:24,730
people are overwhelmed they actually

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,709
start seeing patterns because because

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,680
our brain cannot handle a really

00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:31,480
complicated world how our brain is

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,820
always trying to make sense of the world

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,310
around us and for example way when you

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:40,420
get more and more dots which are totally

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:42,279
random for example here you don't know

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,940
that a lot of people do not see random

00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:48,279
dots but they start seeing poodles right

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,860
or you've seen people looking at the

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:54,250
cloud and seeing are no monsters bears

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,829
or people looking at it already drunken

00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:02,140
coffee coffee cups and trying to predict

00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:05,709
the future it's our way of telling it's

00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:08,079
our way of that our brain tells us oh

00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:10,510
it's so too

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:15,310
too complicated I want to make it simple

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:18,760
again and here is an example where it

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:22,300
could be a problem in programming let's

00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:27,190
say we have this these are a lot of you

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:30,579
a lot of even our statements right so if

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,769
if a person is reading it after probably

00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:33,880
the second or the third they will get

00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:36,730
the general pattern

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:40,180
oh we're just checking about type right

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:43,360
and then something happens for for a

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:46,570
specific type but there is a great

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,120
chance they will not see that we

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:52,860
actually broke the pattern in few places

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,560
so with this it is really important to

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,290
have our patterns in um in in in a much

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:02,520
simpler ways like for example if this

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:06,570
was in an object we couldn't he wouldn't

00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:14,700
be so easy for us for us to break the

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:18,210
pattern the next trick is to is to put

00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:21,270
more focus on on on reaction we are

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:26,640
doing and not so much on the intricacies

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:31,410
of the logic here is an example here is

00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:33,600
the logic of a kid in us in the ass

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,120
spring season basically anywhere in the

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,450
world if it's a weekday it goes to

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,120
school if it's not a weekday but if it's

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:44,640
a Saturday it plays it plays football

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,610
and if it's raining it watches TV

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,400
because they can play food football and

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,980
on Sunday obviously kids have to do

00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,110
their homework some some times and if

00:16:52,980 --> 00:17:00,720
it's winter we like like birds really

00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:04,290
like to hibernate so how how can we make

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,410
this simpler because when you look at it

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:09,660
you don't see any any actual pattern it

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:13,590
is just a random logic going back and

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,630
back and forth and here is what we can

00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:20,070
do we can just focus on the action

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:28,560
themselves and and not so much on the

00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:30,900
conditions people humans are are pretty

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,600
bad at keeping state so they usually try

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:38,520
to avoid it and very often we are pretty

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:41,610
explicit us in what we say so we will

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,010
usually not say that oh if it is spring

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:49,170
I will go and and if it's a weekday I

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:52,140
will go somewhere in instead we usually

00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:55,680
say Oh on a spring on a spring shower

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:58,530
Saturday I would go play football and

00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,400
you can see here that it is really easy

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:06,790
to see the pattern of all the import

00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,790
stuff and these are the actions right

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,250
sometimes it is really hard to escape

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,030
the conditionals and and we don't have

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:19,640
to go into too much trouble so if there

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:22,190
is no visible way to escape from them at

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,230
least the least we can do is is to

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:28,360
simplify and make everything shorter by

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:31,760
by extracting stuff we we can extract

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:34,970
methods for example this monstrous thing

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,880
can just happen this by extracting a

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:41,630
function in the middle and giving it a

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:44,210
proper name or or or we can extract a

00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:49,520
conditional and again giving it up a

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:52,700
proper name if people tell you that they

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,340
don't like so much abstraction it is

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,350
really important to point out that this

00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,060
is simply rection and not abstraction

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,970
we're not observe abstracting thing too

00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:04,820
much we're just putting it inside the in

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:09,590
a very well named functions and usually

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:12,710
it is pretty obvious what do they do as

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,890
a closing I would like to say that

00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:19,010
writing code is actually a lot closer to

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:24,380
user experience and usability then then

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:27,560
we think because our crosses sits a

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:30,920
normal person and we need to make sure

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:35,060
that when when they read our code it is

00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:39,260
easy for them to understand then and it

00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:42,260
doesn't take them too much time in the

00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:45,470
end people are a lot more important than

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,960
than computers and as mr. rubb about

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,780
sincerity in the really great structure

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,150
and interpretation of computer programs

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:56,270
that computer programs are written for

00:19:53,150 --> 00:20:01,780
for people to read and only accidentally

00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:01,780
