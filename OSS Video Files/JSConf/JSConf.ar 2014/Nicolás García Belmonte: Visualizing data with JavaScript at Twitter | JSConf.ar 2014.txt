Title: Nicolás García Belmonte: Visualizing data with JavaScript at Twitter | JSConf.ar 2014
Publication date: 2015-05-10
Playlist: JSConf.ar 2014
Description: 
	At Twitter, the Visual Insights team has been working with the Media, Comms, Government and Brand Strategy teams on different visualizations for big events that happened around the world. Combining web standards, storytelling, data analysis and advanced graphics techniques we aim to translate into images the way people around the world have reacted on Twitter to an event. For our visualizations the Web is the best delivery platform and we use all graphics standards: 2D Canvas, WebGL, SVG and HTML based on the requirements of each visualization and accounting for factors like: number of elements in the screen, shape complexity, interaction, mobile support, libraries available and more. Through the exposition of some of our work, we will describe the workflow we use to create interactive public-facing visualizations at Twitter. We will go through a pipeline which includes stages of research of novel visualization techniques, design and planning for an event, data gathering and processing, prototyping and publishing visualizations.

hello everybody hear me yes cool hi

00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,480
everyone my name is Nicholas Belmonte

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,099
and today I'm going to be talking about

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,430
from data journalism to data

00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:26,380
illustration so basically the work we do

00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:28,179
at Twitter visualizing data so i work at

00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,289
twitter on the visual insights team it's

00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:31,750
a small team that does data

00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:34,090
visualizations and I lead the

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,860
interactive the twitter com project it's

00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:40,750
a web page that has public facing data

00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:42,790
visualizations it's the across team

00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,100
effort between like the communications

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:50,430
team the marketing teams and the

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,430
analytics team which is the team I am on

00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,199
and yeah the main idea behind the data

00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:57,970
visualisations we do which is public

00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,860
facing stuff is trying to kind of

00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,080
leverage the cool things about the

00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,059
platform right so the platform has I'd

00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,100
say like three kind of main features

00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,990
were global we've been called the pulse

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,460
of the planet many times you probably

00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,619
have seen data visualizations of like

00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,329
when people you know wake up and go to

00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:14,740
sleep and how that correlates with the

00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:16,689
number of tweets they make and stuff

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,070
like that so we are really the post of

00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:20,710
your planet also the fact that we're

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,539
real time and that's like a pretty big

00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,060
challenge for data visualization having

00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:27,070
like a real-time platform and finally

00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,570
conversational right so you have you

00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,030
know within the text of a tweet you have

00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,920
at mentions and you have hash tags which

00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,469
are kind of like channels but you also

00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,020
can explore other stuff within the text

00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:39,939
like you know men named entity

00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,490
recognition topic analysis sentiment

00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:44,350
analysis on off stuff so there's a lot

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:48,340
of things that you can take out of those

00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:51,609
140 characters so what we try to do is

00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,649
focus on different verticals and the

00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:55,899
verticals we have depend on kind of like

00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:57,609
the audience we have so we can really

00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:59,259
find those verticals as well but when we

00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:03,490
plan on doing data visualizations we

00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:05,979
have government news sports TV and music

00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,140
and kind of those verticals determine

00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:10,090
how you're going to be thinking about

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,700
doing the visualization and the main

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,280
idea is like what is the tone of the

00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,560
visualization are going to be working on

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,900
do I have to tell a story we have to

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,090
present a lot of data like a million

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,680
data elements to you and for

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,830
you to explore and try to you know get

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,230
your own findings do I need to expose

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,970
the point it's a like explosive data

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,040
visualization or do I have to just be

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,260
fun and you know make you play with the

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,000
data and like maybe doesn't really have

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,400
to be that insightful right so yeah so

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,670
I'm going to try to show a bunch of data

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,160
visualisations or work we did around

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,709
these verticals and kind of like show

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,239
you how we work and maybe inspire you to

00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,940
you know when you're creating your own

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,120
data but also agents to you some of this

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,730
kind of approaches of course we use web

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,880
standards for all this right so the

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,739
stuff i like the most is government

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,829
database but it's also i know like the

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,930
less fun and a bit more boring but we

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:14,110
worked on this one for the state of the

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,000
union address this is like it's done

00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:20,019
once yearly it's like the president of

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,150
the united states gives a speech and and

00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,799
so what we try to do is like government

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,239
people or the people within the

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,220
government really read like long

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,480
documents and stuff like that and so

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,639
what we try to do is like to present

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,680
that very same document but enhanced

00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:40,060
with with the data visualization right

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:41,950
so let's try this yep slowly so what we

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,200
did here is at the top you have a

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,569
summary of the of the speech basically

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,250
the stream graph and we need topic

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,560
analysis on tweets that happen during

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,250
the address of the president so these

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,829
are tweets that talk about energy jobs

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,349
fairness healthcare defense etc the

00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,849
other cool thing is that this is not

00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:03,790
only a summary of what happened during

00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,889
the address is also an index so if I

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,750
like enter the page and like I don't

00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:10,630
really care much about reading like 40

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,329
pages of like a transcript for for a for

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,190
speech maybe what I can just do is well

00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:16,630
I care about you know what the president

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,910
said about health care and so I can just

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,450
go click there and so this takes me

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,979
exactly to the time to what the

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,010
president was saying when these tweets

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:28,780
occurred so on the right one we have is

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,669
kind of like something that leverages a

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,979
bit more the real-time aspect of the

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,770
platform and as you know when you scroll

00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:36,139
down

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,599
tell you what is the most discussed

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,629
topic on twitter and also the

00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:43,430
distribution of those tweets so like you

00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:45,620
can say you know people in like this

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,860
specific state care about a lot about

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,479
health care but if you go over to adult

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,340
defense it'll tell you that you know

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,860
some other states care more about

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,990
defense and so the main idea within the

00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:02,780
government type of data visualisations

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:06,050
is always try to try to enhance whatever

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,289
document we have and so how we did this

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,659
is a very iterative process with a lot

00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:13,849
of feedback and you know looking as much

00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:15,979
as you can the first the first iteration

00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:18,139
was this we didn't know we were going to

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:20,090
have the transcript before the speech

00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,000
because we annotated every paragraph

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,219
with the timestamp of like you know when

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,690
did he start saying this till the end of

00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:28,580
that paragraph and then grabbed tweets

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,530
and did that topic analysis for that

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,909
specific paragraph so in order to do

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,550
that you need to have the transcript

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:36,530
before the president actually says

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,900
anything before the actual speech and

00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,560
that's props to the media team for

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,210
having that so what we did is the first

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,190
approach just have like you know every

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,870
row is a minute every column is a

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,400
different state in the United States and

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,000
then we'll just have like volume of

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,009
tweets and this was horrible like I show

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,860
this to a team I was like I I mean

00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:00,020
there's nothing interesting from this no

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,759
no interesting inside anything instead

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,469
of having the transcript we were just

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,819
planning on just putting some quotes on

00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:07,310
the right that the president mentioned

00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,930
during that minute and then at the

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,180
bottom instead of having like a topic

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,430
analysis we were just using a word

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,779
frequency count so for example we're

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,340
just like kind of the frequency of the

00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:18,440
words in the tweets for that minute so

00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,840
in this case is you know it's the third

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,669
minute within the speech and the words

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,969
you can see are like Obama president

00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:27,650
State Union watching watch which

00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:30,370
basically means I just got here i'm

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:33,800
watching the state of the union address

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,169
so this was the second second iteration

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,000
we already knew we were going to have to

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:41,240
transcript for the for the speech itself

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,310
before it happened but we didn't have it

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,039
by like by that time because it was like

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,729
three three weeks earlier so what we did

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,520
is we took the 20

00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:53,849
13 State of the Union address transcript

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,169
and then we took 2013 tweets and all

00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:57,990
that stuff and we started doing that

00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:59,659
that data mining with that we build the

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,129
data visualization with this and

00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:03,659
feedback was very positive like people

00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,430
were like you know scrolling down and

00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,809
seeing like what was happening with the

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,819
topic analysis and like they were

00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:11,490
actually getting pretty interesting

00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,960
insights from the VIS the third one was

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,879
like you know people were mostly saying

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,499
like hey would like to you know have

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,139
some sort of summary of the speech at

00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:21,029
the top and what can we do and you know

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,559
stream graphs are very kind of

00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,909
mainstreaming right now so it's like

00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:25,979
well I want to try something different

00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:29,189
but people didn't like it so in the end

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:31,379
we ended up building a stream graph so

00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:34,830
this took about four to five iterations

00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,969
within three weeks I'd say that you know

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:40,319
would recommend having a process that

00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:43,050
even iterates more this after that was

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:49,620
turned into a paper that I presented at

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:52,349
I triple v's in Paris last week and yeah

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,949
for other examples of interesting things

00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:59,219
we did with gov data is this one is

00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:01,169
about the elections the midterm election

00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:03,180
so like government and senator elections

00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:05,610
and stuff like that so what we did is we

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,770
took all of the candidates that are on

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,050
Twitter and we took all the mutual

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,509
follows for the candidates so if one a

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,060
follows B&B folks a we will draw a line

00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:17,249
with that then we will color them by

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,249
democrat or republican and then run this

00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:22,709
force directed algorithm so these

00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:24,599
clusters emerged from the visualization

00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:26,669
algorithm it's not like we decided to

00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,529
put these blue notes on the left and red

00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:30,870
nodes on the right it's just like the

00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:33,690
algorithm it's a physical simulation

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,099
right and so it ends up showing a

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,690
cluster on the left hand cursor on the

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,190
right which means that Republicans like

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,229
the fall Republicans and Democrats like

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,289
to follow Democrats and there's not much

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:45,449
communication between them and then you

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,310
can go and go ahead and click on one of

00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:49,319
the candidates and see exact like the

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,139
exact list of all the candidates that he

00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:54,690
follows and is followed back and you

00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,540
know all the Democrat and so on but

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,149
always trying to maintain kind of

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,829
a good footprint aspect on the webpage

00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:04,290
so this is something that you can scroll

00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:07,320
down and we have the kind of the main

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:12,600
points that we or many insights from the

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,519
database so very document-oriented and

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,139
this is the third one that I'm not going

00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,720
to be showing but it's not interacted or

00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:24,029
20 comments a narrative database that we

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:27,630
did for the Brazil elections so the

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:29,459
other vertical is news so news is kind

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,319
of interesting because you need to act

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,730
fast it's not like you have three weeks

00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:34,889
to do something because otherwise it

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,449
won't be news anymore right and the

00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:39,870
other thing is that you need to be

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:41,509
mindful so if you take some kind of you

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,949
know disaster that happened somewhere

00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:45,269
you need to be very conscious of like

00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:48,660
you know what you're showing and what

00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:52,230
you're not showing in this case this

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,569
visit that we built was during the or

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:58,440
right after the typhoon haiyan struck

00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:59,819
the philippines and it was you know i

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,440
was looking at my twitter feed and

00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:03,620
everybody was saying like hey please

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,790
help the philippines it sit around like

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,920
almost all the tweets i had on my tongue

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,199
and what about that so it's like well

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,389
this is a huge thing so let's try to

00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:18,720
visualize how big it is and so what we

00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:20,220
did is I had kind of this idea of having

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,839
this map that is centered on the

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,690
Philippines which is the main focus of

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,769
attention right and then try to get all

00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,420
the different locations where the

00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:28,829
geo-located tweets were happening

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,310
geo-located tweets that were mentioning

00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:36,329
Philippines and help in about like 22

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,920
different languages and then yeah I drew

00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:39,389
a line from each one of those locations

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,069
to the to the Philippines because

00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,560
they're talking about about that and

00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:46,560
then I run this algorithm which clusters

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,689
the edges so these groups edges by it's

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,880
not grouped by hand but it's like this

00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:53,250
algorithm again creates clusters of

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,829
edges with in that graph and these

00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,800
regions organically emerge from that

00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:01,560
algorithm so now you can see and you can

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,300
use this as a navigation system and say

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,610
like I want to focus on the US and see

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:10,230
all the more interesting or engaging or

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:13,540
informative tweets about typhoon haiyan

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:22,899
in North America and same happen in

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:25,510
Europe and so on so for this it is we

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,970
start with like any query rectangular

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,470
projection of a map and then we do a

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,269
small thing which is just Center it on

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,190
the Philippines which is a small thing

00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:35,160
but I think that it's like an important

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,660
thing because it puts that in the middle

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,279
then we just roll a straight line from

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,079
each one of those locations to the

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,329
Center of the Philippines and then we

00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,519
run this algorithm which is called

00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:51,399
multi-level agglomerative edge bundling

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:53,170
for large graphs mingle and then we

00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,660
color-coded each one of those clusters

00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,149
with a categorical color palette so we

00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,980
we can easily identify all the clusters

00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:04,209
so up to hear that algorithm is really

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:06,970
awesome it works really fast and it's

00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:08,560
it's it has a very clever algorithm the

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,570
only thing is that when you bundle all

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,730
these edges together into one group the

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,699
resulting edge is also one pixel width

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,829
width which is not you know this the

00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,570
thing you'd like because it means that

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:22,870
it doesn't really take into account the

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:27,699
the weight of each bundle so we extended

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:29,290
this algorithm so that I would would it

00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:31,089
would take into account bundle weight

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,180
and it would take into account like

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:38,140
direct directed edges and we open

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,850
sourced this we have a great open source

00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,010
team that always want us to open source

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,339
as much as possible so that was actually

00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:47,709
pretty easy to do so we have kind of

00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:49,060
like a kitchen sink for that here this

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:51,550
is the example you can choose the number

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:55,390
of neighbors to cluster so this means

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,250
that you know this will if you put more

00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,339
neighbors there will be less clusters

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,990
were with more edges basically and what

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:04,120
you can interpolate here is between the

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,490
initial state of straight lines to the

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,949
bundle edges you can play a bit with the

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,209
margin which is the stuff we added to to

00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:13,540
have this kind of like bundle weight

00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:15,610
being taken care of you can color by

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:19,149
cluster as i showed before or you can

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,380
call x direction so in this case edges

00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:22,390
that start from a bloop

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,640
point to a red point are like the

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:28,000
direction the direction is encoded in

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:31,240
that so here it's not very easy to see

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,420
how many edges are going from one place

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,870
to the other and vice versa so what we

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,220
did also is we extended the algorithm to

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,140
sort a bit the edges when you're

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,430
creating the bundles to group the edges

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,430
going from one direction to the other

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,930
and so now it's a bit easier to see that

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:55,720
about half of the edges are going from

00:13:46,930 --> 00:14:00,220
one place to the other and so on yeah so

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,350
on sports the audience for sport is like

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,870
pretty geeky right it's like they always

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,330
like to know the exact stats and goals

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,560
and like yellow cards and so on so we

00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,890
had a lot of fun during the World Cup

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:16,870
with this this this interactive

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:21,550
visualization that was built what by one

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:23,140
of the people in our team cryst it's

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,970
pretty amazing because it's an

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,380
exploratory visualization I'll give you

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,620
all the matches during the World Cup

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:32,080
with all the tweets per minute during

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,330
each match and I will show you how those

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,800
correlate with each one of the goals so

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,290
here you can see during a match how

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,860
those correlate with specific goals and

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,540
you can scroll down and see all the

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,340
matches you can see how many tweets

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,200
happen during each match you can see how

00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,020
many goals we had you can see how many

00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,210
yellow cards red cards and so on and

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,460
also you can do is just like select a

00:14:52,210 --> 00:15:02,290
team and follow the path of that team

00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:04,210
during the entire tournament another

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,000
interesting database that we did with

00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:10,120
this was and that really shows the kind

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:17,110
of like global aspect of the platform is

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:19,450
this one so what we did is basically you

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,440
know we we had this hash flags during

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,530
the World Cup you know that a

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,120
three-letter country code that you could

00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,460
use with the hashtag and this will give

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:32,410
you the flag of the country right so if

00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:35,200
you put like hashtag a rj r g you'd see

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,880
the the Argentine flag so we use the

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,830
hash flags we know that for example

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,350
argentina will use allure of the

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,480
argentine hash flag right but what is

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,220
the second country most mentioned by by

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,690
people in Argentina or what is the

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,240
second country was mentioned by France

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,750
or by the US and so on and so we started

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:57,250
analyzing bad to see interesting

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:59,020
relationships with these countries so

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,540
for example if you go to Argentina you

00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:05,020
might see that countries that mention

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,339
Argentina the most are Nigeria and you

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,839
can see the list on the left basically

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:09,550
and on the right or the country's being

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,710
mentioned by Argentina Argentina has

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:15,040
been mentioning Brazil Colombia is the

00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:18,580
second most and so on so what's

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,110
interesting is that we started seeing a

00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,450
lot of interesting immigration part of

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:26,110
patterns so for example if you click on

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:28,330
the USA well Iran talks a lot about the

00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:32,260
USA but the other thing is that on the

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:34,210
right the USA the country most mentioned

00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,310
by your USA is Mexico and and this kind

00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,980
of tells you that there's no not only

00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,450
one voice in the u.s. just like rooting

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,670
for the US but they're like multiple

00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:45,160
communities and the biggest one after

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,630
the the company you know the one that

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,050
roots for the USA is the one that roots

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:52,900
for Mexico and so on same happens with

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:56,310
France for example you see a lot of

00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,380
likes french-speaking countries like

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:02,200
Cote d'Ivoire Ivory Coast and

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,449
Switzerland and Nigeria maybe that talk

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,280
about France and then France the first

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:08,140
one you know most mention countries

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,459
Algeria and kind of like also tells you

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:15,280
a lot about immigration within France

00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:19,990
and also you can see proximity so for

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,939
example croatia and bosnia and

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,010
herzegovina are like really close to

00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,630
each other right and so you have the

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,760
country most measuring both you and

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,080
herzegovina croatia and then Croatia's

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:35,050
the country most mentioned by

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:37,210
bosnia-herzegovina all right so I've

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,190
been showing SVG to the canvas kind of

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,100
stuff one is one is interesting to use

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,420
WebGL so maybe when you have a lot of

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,130
elements to render that's for

00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,640
exploratory data visualization but also

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,200
when you have a story to tell

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,310
or when you want to use like kind of

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,020
like the cool factor so for example we

00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,630
did this visualization for Cannes Lions

00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,250
so this was part of a deck and the

00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,430
visualization was exploring mentions of

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,890
ian mckellen and sir patrick stewart and

00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:05,600
mentions of both users through time and

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,100
so the main idea was kind of like to

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,130
show the correlations of like you know

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:13,220
how how the relationship we do this to

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,470
actors came to be and so we correlated

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,060
this with you know a trip they made to

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,260
new york city in which like they were

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,550
working on a play together and then also

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:26,810
towards the end they were also talking

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,880
or mentioning there were mentions of

00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:30,650
both a lot too because they were kind of

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,540
like promoting the latest like x-men

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,280
video and so you can see kind of

00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,710
correlations of those things so this is

00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,470
more like for impact or kind of like I

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,750
eye candy or I call it data illustration

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:45,110
as opposed to data visualization or data

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,730
journalism the other thing is maybe if

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,830
you want to make interactive experiences

00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,990
and we build this for CES and South by

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,870
Southwest and so this is built from

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,700
scratch we already knew which machine we

00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,650
were targeting and so we started working

00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,940
with WebGL and like implementing from

00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,920
scratch all the touch event and

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,290
multi-touch stuff and so we built this

00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,540
globe in which you can kind of filter

00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,520
tweets for example by a keyword South by

00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,320
Southwest twist and you can swipe

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,300
through the different tweets and that

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,890
will correlate with the tweets on the

00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,190
globe so there are like two linked

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:19,460
visualizations there if you zoom in or

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,700
you do that type of stuff we worked also

00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,110
on having this expanded to be a plane

00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,120
from a globe and then you could zoom in

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,470
with both fingers and kind of pan around

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,840
and so this was like a very fun

00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,810
interactive experience not very kind of

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:37,550
insightful but super fun and people were

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:39,260
like kind of hooked and using their by

00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,170
the way there's a book called WebGL

00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,280
insights and write in a chapter on that

00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:47,150
definitely recommend you to check that

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,850
out and yeah we talked about things like

00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,770
this temperature anomalies data

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,780
visualization which this one is using

00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,820
NASA imagery to kind of show the

00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,440
differences in temperature in the world

00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,559
so if you see around like for example

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,919
1900 it's it's pretty

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:06,049
mild but if you go to 90s or even like

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,360
2000s you can see that there's like a

00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,350
huge change in temperature anomalies so

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:18,409
this means that the temperature is

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:21,769
growing more than 33 degrees I won't

00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:23,659
show this so key takeaways so if there's

00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:25,940
one thing you need to kind of remember

00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:27,620
after this talk is the audience the

00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,450
audience determines the verticals we're

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,759
focusing on it determines the tone of

00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,710
your data visualization and it ends up

00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,139
determining also the standards you're

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,879
using because for example a touareg we

00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:39,590
have more than half of the people just

00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:41,299
like logging with their mobile phones so

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,529
what phones are they're using what are

00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:47,149
the best standards you use for those

00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:48,379
phones etc and yeah I just recommend you

00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:50,289
to check that out interactive the

00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:53,289
