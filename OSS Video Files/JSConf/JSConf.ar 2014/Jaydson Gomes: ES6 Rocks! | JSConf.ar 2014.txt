hi my name is Jade song Gomez I'm from

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,580
Brazil it's my second time in Buenos

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,380
Aires and I'm i feel i am home because

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,990
when as itÃ­s looks like porto alegre but

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,660
much much bigger and then i'm home

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,140
buenos aires awesome my talk was about

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,840
es6 the next version of java script we

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,420
have a lot of changes in the language we

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,720
have a basic stuff and main features and

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,079
my talk was about that i'm showing how

00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,180
to use in it today because the

00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,360
specification will be releasing just in

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,059
the next year but you can use it now and

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,790
my toughest about this the main features

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,730
i think is modules we can now have

00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,340
separated modules in javascript and they

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,309
have arrow functions that similar to

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,200
lambda is in another language and fix a

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,119
lot of issues that we already have it

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,880
javascript i really believe in

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,880
JavaScript so I think the present and

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,090
the future will be about javascript

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,569
javascript is already running in a lot

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,610
of different environments and I think

00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:29,280
the you can bet on on javascript

00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:33,229
javascript is one of the pillars of the

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,970
one of the skeletons of the internet so

00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:38,849
javascript is spread is we use it

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,390
everywhere everywhere website is using

00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:45,119
javascript and with the new

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,099
specification we without now developers

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,369
have another way to do what we are doing

00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,369
