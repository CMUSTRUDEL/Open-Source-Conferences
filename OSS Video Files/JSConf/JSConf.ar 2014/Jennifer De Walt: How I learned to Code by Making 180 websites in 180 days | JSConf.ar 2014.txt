my name is Jennifer Dewalt I am from San

00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,420
Francisco California in the United

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,100
States and I taught myself to code by

00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,840
making 180 websites and a hundred eighty

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,430
days javascript was the first

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,290
programming language that I really

00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,230
learned through the hundred eighty

00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,239
websites project and most of the

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,370
websites that I did in that project use

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,329
JavaScript very heavily although I did

00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:41,810
use Ruby on Rails these days I do a lot

00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:44,809
of hacks using node.js and client-side

00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,910
JavaScript working with hardware so I

00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:50,420
gave a talk about how I taught myself to

00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,519
code by making 180 websites 180 days and

00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,920
so I gave a little bit of a history of

00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:57,769
myself I came from a small farming

00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,739
community and ended up studying fine art

00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:02,690
in school but after I graduated I

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:06,950
realized that I wasn't content with just

00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,360
using all these amazing web and Internet

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,950
products that I actually want to start

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,380
building them myself so I decided I

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,960
wanted to learn to code and I decided to

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,580
do a self-directed project where I would

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,400
make one website a day every single day

00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,920
for 180 days so in my talk I went

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,200
through a handful actually 40 of my

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,670
websites that I made during that project

00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,770
starting from the very beginning and

00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:32,060
going to the very end of the project

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:35,780
exploring things like the toys games

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:39,110
data visualizations tools and even real

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,790
time communication apps so recently I

00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,610
have been working for a company called

00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,320
wits at AI and we make an API that makes

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,270
it really easy for developers to add

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,030
voice interfaces to their Internet of

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:54,320
Things products so I've been focusing a

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:57,260
lot on how JavaScript can be applied to

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,990
hardware and IOT devices to make

00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:03,110
interfaces better and so I've really

00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:05,600
focused on how the JavaScript is going

00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:08,119
to grow alongside the Internet of Things

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,140
movement and I'm really excited to be

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,530
kind of on the cutting edge of that

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,530
