Title: María Evangelina Ferreira: Parallax 101 | JSConf.ar 2014
Publication date: 2015-05-10
Playlist: JSConf.ar 2014
Description: 
	If a click is the decision, scrolling is a resolution. Parallax, moving content along with scroll pace, has become one of the most fashionable design tactics. It has dumped the ʺAbove the Foldʺ idea that people don't scroll by simply encouraging users to do so by entertaining them with movement and a sensation of depth. In this talk, we will go through real-time examples of Parallax animations, its anchors and its performance.

	00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:14,540
so about the

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:18,950
it's a silly way that I heard of when I

00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:21,680
stopped start working on marketing and I

00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,360
created different landing pages and only

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,540
done in benches people who are saying

00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,759
like all the important information

00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:32,180
should be above the fold which means the

00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:35,840
user data scroll and all the extras

00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,540
should be below so that meant for

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,870
marketing that if we want the user to

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:44,600
convert that means to fill a forum on

00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,570
something like that then we must put the

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,450
form above everything an old information

00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,910
below and honestly for me that didn't

00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,520
make any sense because if the usual

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,570
dozen read what we are sailing we cannot

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:04,280
asked him over here to fill out the form

00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:05,810
so i don't agree with the theory and I

00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,630
don't know if you are with me who

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,850
doesn't agree with the theory you have

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,750
some people some people again not many

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:17,330
but I'm going to prove it wrong so and

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,390
let's chicken and then Wikipedia

00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:23,420
Wikipedia we have a scroll through with

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:27,470
video or of our lives I mean high school

00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:30,409
is full of it we scroll we know that we

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:33,320
scroll and then let's check out this

00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:36,500
website which we all know about this

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,080
tray is khan website and according to

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,530
the above default theory this website

00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,200
should be a massive fail because the

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:49,040
form is below the fold but on the other

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,250
hand it has sold out so what what's the

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,909
key point in this why did it work well

00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:58,939
they engage the user basically

00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:03,080
information and other stuff like the

00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:07,040
terminal the countdown the other

00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:09,470
countdown in the workshops again I mean

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,200
why did they put game in there I don't

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,810
know they just say I'm going to put a

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,150
game in there and it wasn't pretty well

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,280
it didn't make any sense I didn't have

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,660
to put a game in there but they engage

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,550
the user and

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,220
gonna spend like 30 minutes in this

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,340
website without getting bored and really

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:34,170
bad at it but some people may be better

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:38,490
and the nyan cat is like hidden in the

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:41,340
planetarium and then the suspicious

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,940
octopus another thing at the bottom of

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,340
the page that again it gives the

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,030
sensation of I want to keep scrolling

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,790
because I want to discover more stuff so

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,580
yeah if they ought to boost has nothing

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,890
to do with say yes maybe but it's

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,820
something else that you can add to the

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:05,940
website so for me really the about four

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,880
theories nothing man excuse for lazy web

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,980
design it's like I don't have much time

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,430
to do this I'm just gonna put the forum

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:17,550
over there and hope to the users to fill

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,490
out the form but now if you really put

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,740
and love into it you can make this

00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:27,000
awesome website that the shades Khan has

00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:29,130
made and then Troy us to paradox by whom

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,950
what has parallax to do with the

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,890
waterfall well parallax means scrolling

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,590
so if the user doesn't scroll he will

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:40,560
never enjoy parallax but parallax is a

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:44,340
wave of engaging the user while he or

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,350
she rolls so a current Wikipedia

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,840
parallax it's like moving the hbu port

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,330
which will be us but we are not really

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,350
moving we are giving the sensation of

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:58,980
the user moving so this trend when

00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:02,190
design began with nike website in 2011

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,980
and it means moving different elements

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,080
in different layers along with scroll

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,140
base that means the user Scrolls an

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,360
element's move and this has the

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,620
sensation of perspective and depth that

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,739
you cannot give in any other way so how

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,980
do you do parallax in web design this

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,560
was one of the challenges when I started

00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:29,880
with this talk there are so many ways of

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,610
playing parallax and I found for which

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,350
were like the best one is using jQuery

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,650
the other one is Suzanne

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:40,950
library CSS or something called pillar

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:44,310
which is not really parallax well I'm

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:48,360
option one is shake weary and let's

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:52,050
imagine we have this improper thing with

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:58,800
an image Powerpuff Girls and son info

00:04:52,050 --> 00:05:01,980
about that we add some CSS to it what's

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,710
important about the CSS is that you must

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,110
generate overflow because without

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:11,460
overflow parallax really doesn't work

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:14,610
and then info which is this red thing

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:18,470
about and must be relative if it's not

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:22,680
relative then you will have this problem

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:24,810
that when you apply parallax the image

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,260
will cover the text and you will be able

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:31,950
to read it so they the info must be

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:36,480
relative or absolute in must have some

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:40,650
see index applied to it so and again we

00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:43,110
must have this info element which is all

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,830
the information relative and wiped out

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:50,400
when we apply parallax in this in this

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,890
form we will apply it through transform

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,330
property it's a CSS turn for property

00:05:52,890 --> 00:06:00,330
and we're not really telling the image

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:04,260
to be relative or absolute or fixed so

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:09,000
why does it cover the text well because

00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,770
the transform property and create the

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,870
hips like position relative when Tim it

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,200
means that grace and us talking context

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:20,100
so that means its original space is

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:23,580
still occupied but with it this newest

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,850
talking context and it activates the see

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,340
index so even though the image is still

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,500
a static when we apply transform

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,910
property to it it's al aliy wicka wicka

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:40,080
and becomes relative it's a strange but

00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:44,790
it does so info must be relative a list

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,680
or have AC index so when we have the CSS

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,969
then we apply some shake wearing any

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,819
version of jQuery

00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:53,879
will do and then we write some jQuery

00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:56,159
it's not that easier so this is one way

00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,739
of doing battle axe Russia query which

00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:02,849
is calling the scroll function on rapper

00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:04,739
and inside that you call for a scroll

00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:07,619
tube a scroll job is a function that

00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:12,179
returns how many pixels has the user

00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:15,599
scroll like 30-50 that so we create

00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:18,659
something like this mmm that means we

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,389
ask for scroll top and we save that into

00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:23,610
distance and then we tell the image

00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:27,360
inside wrapper which is the Powerpuff

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:30,059
Girls to translate y half of the

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:35,549
distance that the rest of the content

00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:37,979
and that as a result gives this so as

00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:39,719
you can see the image Scrolls at a

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:44,969
different pace than the rest of the

00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:47,969
content so yeah that's really all so

00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:51,479
then we can apply a negative value just

00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:56,309
a dash and we can make the image go up

00:07:51,479 --> 00:08:00,089
as if it isn't working but and the image

00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:02,909
goes up imagine something will fail so

00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:05,729
yes it's often but there's a little

00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:08,279
problem is that a scroll function

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:11,579
doesn't have really well performance I

00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:14,819
mean if we are applying it's only to one

00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:17,549
image inside of website is ok but if we

00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,499
want to do everything with a scroll

00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:23,189
function then we have a performance

00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:25,679
problem so the right thing will be used

00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:28,499
for qwest animation frame but you have

00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:31,169
to break like a lot of JavaScript and we

00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:34,079
have weird shapes from we have a lot of

00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:37,740
JavaScript not really so I go for option

00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:39,899
to rush up to our libraries well there

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,979
are many as four magic peril Akshay's

00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:47,189
scroller and many more I go for scroller

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,529
what's interesting about it and you

00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:51,420
don't require shake wary you don't need

00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,130
to be an expert in JavaScript that's

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,780
awesome for me

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,270
and its massive realizing something

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:59,850
called data attributes data attributes

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:03,780
are attributes that you apply to the

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:07,830
element you want to transform and you

00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:10,350
simply in provide an encore inside the

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,960
website when the element reaches does

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,520
that anchor the animation triggers it's

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,250
something like this let's imagine we

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,960
have a proper with information something

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:24,630
called move move along with this wording

00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,740
circle and the more information we call

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:31,910
a scroller we initiate it and then we

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:37,280
have something like this if we apply

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:41,580
this thing so what is going on here well

00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,710
we indicate this to and data attributes

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,650
one if data top and the other one data

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:49,290
button on that atop we tell the element

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:52,050
to be rather and rotate 360 degrees

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,870
which means more round and then that's

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:58,350
about on we tell it to be blue and not

00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,840
to be rotated so data top applies and

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,090
triggers when the element reaches the

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:07,410
top of the page that's why we see it red

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:10,230
and the data bottom attributes applies

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:13,260
when we reach is the bottom of the page

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:16,620
so that's basically where we apply these

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,050
data attributes on the the anchors and

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,260
the animation three years when that

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,360
element which is that point something

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,850
like this you apply to an element when

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,880
the element which is that point it turns

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:33,000
to what we say and there are a lot of

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,420
data with tribute this is actually from

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:42,120
the github page of a scroller you have

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:47,940
all this and to like a cheat sheet you

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:54,030
can apply any kind of CSS to it because

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:57,920
it actually depends on CSS so any kind

00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:01,290
of CSS you can apply there it will work

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,120
then and what if we want faster parallax

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,910
well

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,240
and we can just avoid a script because

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:11,339
we hate JavaScript or because just you

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,470
you don't want to bright JavaScript and

00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:16,320
you will be able to create a faster but

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:20,700
lacks and that's option free which is

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,339
using CSS and only CSS and what's great

00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,070
about doing paralysis you don't need to

00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,960
worry you don't need JavaScript really

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:34,560
you don't need anything about it's pure

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:44,460
CSS here are here's some one of the

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:47,610
examples there and so we can see this

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:50,130
has this parallax effects effect on it

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,920
and it's only CSS is pure CSS do you

00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,920
don't worry javascript jquery or you

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,010
don't need anything else bad CSS and

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,550
what you need to do this is actually use

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:04,589
perspective property in CSS that means

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,709
that suddenly Internet Explorer 10

00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:14,010
doesn't read it but in the future it

00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:17,190
will and this is another example we cssm

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:21,180
parallax this example is from scott

00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:24,120
calhoun he created SS mixing in order

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,820
for every one of us to to have it easier

00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:31,680
when we do parallax with the SS so you

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:34,500
can check this one out as well and then

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,990
another great example if this one that

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,010
comes with an article explaining and

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,330
step-by-step how to do this and it

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,730
worked like this you have those

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,190
different layers and as you scroll all

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,770
those layers are going one below the

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,690
other and it gives again the sensation

00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:56,029
of reflective you because you are

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,029
actually using perspective in CSS

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,030
then this there's option for in case you

00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,490
don't get along with CSS or you don't

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,430
get along with parallax in JavaScript or

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,920
you you just don't want to write one

00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:15,640
line of code which is something called

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,670
Peter well Peter is not really parallax

00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,070
is something called bigger so sometimes

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:25,060
it is confused like parallax that is not

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:28,690
parallax and it comes with well she is

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:31,000
it's a small thing only three claw bites

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,880
and he has many options for the

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,650
animations like the duration the delay

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,540
the duration many other cool stuff and

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:43,660
the only problem is that once you play

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,520
it you cannot replay it that's the

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,350
difference with paradox when I do

00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,010
parallax when I scroll to the top again

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,720
the animations go again not here the

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,480
animation only triggers when the page

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,150
loads when the user Scrolls for the

00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,550
first time but then everything remains

00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:04,600
like that and it's actually what the

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:07,180
shyest conf website uses so it goes with

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,350
animation CSS which is something like

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:14,800
this and you pick animation like bounce

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:20,830
in up system working but you can check

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:25,600
it out a cure hmm well can't you get a

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:28,810
layer it works and then you are these

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:33,450
thing with cheese and well she is with

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:36,310
some brown loading images but what is

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:40,120
something like this and full of comic

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:42,520
sans and all that and yes it doesn't

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,810
require shake wearing or JavaScript nor

00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:50,710
any kind of code you can create this ma

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:53,890
this Peter effects which is basically

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:55,330
this it's what the shades can we use is

00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,090
when all the things appear out of

00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:01,330
nowhere and as you can see as I scroll

00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:04,270
the animations trigger but the only

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:05,950
problem is as I scroll back again the

00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,840
animations don't we go again that's

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,430
different with parallax and it doesn't

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,320
give the sensation of perspective

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,320
because there is known perspective in

00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:19,210
this but you don't write a line of code

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:22,170
in JavaScript or CSS additional so Oh

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:26,459
what our final recommendations for

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:29,589
parallax well first of all and

00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:32,110
responsive first then animations them

00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:35,760
parallax than everything when you apply

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:38,110
parallax to a website you destroy the

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,149
the organization and the flow of the

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,180
content because you begin creating

00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:46,060
relative absolute and fixed elements and

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,860
everything's closed crazy so if you

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:51,070
apply parallax before making your web

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,570
site for mobile or responsive then at

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,670
the time you want you to make you want

00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,649
to make it responsive you go Gracie

00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,649
because I or the whole of your website

00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:01,839
is kind of weird so make responsive

00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:06,250
first and then up the animation of the

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,990
parallax but parallax and especially a

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,720
scroller doesn't work really well

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:13,510
neither on mobile devices and on touch

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,560
devices what can you do about it you can

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:19,630
turn it off with inquiries or and you

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,570
can use moderniser to turn it off on

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,970
touchscreens yes because touch screens

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,660
and parallax and especially scroller

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,920
like don't get along really well and

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,160
what else it's better to animate

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,800
transform property and opacity

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,709
transforming in scale askew rotate and

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,180
translate because those are cheaper and

00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:43,750
they were better they have better

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:45,730
performance and opacity as well and if

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:49,660
you want to animate colors you cannot

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:53,050
use Excel SML and because you cannot go

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,510
through an f 20 there's no transition

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:59,350
between them you have to use our cpa or

00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:03,880
hsl and simply because you can go

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:07,720
through 255 20 but no from f20 it

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:10,750
doesn't work that is simple changing the

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,970
mode the color mode and don't go crazy

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,890
over absolute position in because

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,260
there's this idea that I have two

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,570
absolution everything and

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,640
it's not really necessary because once

00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:24,850
you apply transform the element will

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,550
have as the index and you can apply

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:30,310
relative the only problem with up to the

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,800
positioning it does is really like the

00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:37,300
black sheep of the family because it's

00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,910
and just like a rebellion in it and it

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,980
does whatever you wants so you have to

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,980
be certain that you can handle a lot of

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:48,130
absolute elements otherwise i recommend

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,250
you to go for a relative or fixed

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,320
elements but on the other hand absolute

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,890
and fitch have better performance than

00:17:53,320 --> 00:18:02,440
relative so you can like go from one on

00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:03,760
the order so and go soon and choose the

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,400
best implementation according to your

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,010
project needs simply there are thousand

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,780
ways of doing parallax and nobody's

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,510
going to tell you anything is you use

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,120
pillar instead of writing hundred lines

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:19,480
of JavaScript or if you use a library

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:24,160
and you don't use pillar whatever is

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:27,490
great for your project use it and please

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,650
try to keep keep a clean HTML because I

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:33,640
seen horrible things and I'm one of

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:37,540
those semantics crazy people so yeah try

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:42,060
to keep keep it clean okay well thank

00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,060
