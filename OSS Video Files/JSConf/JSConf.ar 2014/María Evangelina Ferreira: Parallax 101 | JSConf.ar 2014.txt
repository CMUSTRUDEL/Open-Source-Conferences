Description: 
	If a click is the decision, scrolling is a resolution. Parallax, moving content along with scroll pace, has become one of the most fashionable design tactics. It has dumped the ʺAbove the Foldʺ idea that people don't scroll by simply encouraging users to do so by entertaining them with movement and a sensation of depth. In this talk, we will go through real-time examples of Parallax animations, its anchors and its performance.
