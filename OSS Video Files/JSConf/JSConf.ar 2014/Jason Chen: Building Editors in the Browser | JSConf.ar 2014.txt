my name is jason chen and I'm from San

00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,050
Francisco California in the United

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,150
States and I most

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,150
for developer I don't actually work out

00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,640
any company right now I i started my own

00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,649
company two and a half years ago sold

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,939
that or three and a half years ago so

00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:32,769
bad and then worked at worked at the

00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:35,680
acquiring company for two years which

00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:38,019
was salesforce.com and after leaving

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,269
that I just went to work on open-source

00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:43,720
full-time the company that i started i

00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:46,899
was i was the founder and i was a

00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,989
software engineer so I took a lot of the

00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:51,670
product along with my co-founder and the

00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:54,430
company basically it was a collaborative

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,620
text editor of a code editor and so

00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,170
people used it to do remote interviews

00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,980
or any sort of code collaboration

00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,649
remotely and at some point we wanted to

00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,860
transition that that into rich text

00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:11,200
which is what got me started what got me

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,050
started going with quill GS which is the

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,060
thing that I was talking about today

00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,390
yeah it started it started at the

00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,700
company that I started which ciebie on

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,280
and we continue to work on it because he

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,369
all source wanted to build that into

00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,110
their product and so we continue to work

00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:32,440
on it at Salesforce although not as much

00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:35,500
and then after i left i continue to work

00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:38,080
on quill and so when we still sail

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,550
source open source it under bsd so it's

00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,160
very permissive license and they're

00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,800
they're very supportive even when we

00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,509
were there of a bus working on it and so

00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,879
but i decided i kind of wanted to do

00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:50,379
that more and things ended with the

00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,929
project that we were working on at co

00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:56,739
source as well yeah so yeah so

00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:58,660
javascript is the editor that i'm

00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:01,450
working on quill j/s is completely and

00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,190
in JavaScript or I guess technically

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,530
it's in CoffeeScript and it compiles to

00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,160
JavaScript Oh

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,470
or of it on kind of other parts of it

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,250
are in JavaScript but yeah it's

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,540
completely front only JavaScript library

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,980
well so our company was sold to

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,870
Salesforce so it's not really mine

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,950
anymore and I don't have much control

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,920
over it um I'm not sure what their plans

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,709
are for it I've kind of not been a part

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,920
of that for a while so I guess I don't

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,200
know okay yeah I'd like to start another

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,270
company i think currently i love working

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,720
on open source I've met amazing people

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,670
on it while working on it and I think

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,040
it's it's definitely something that I

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,690
wanted to I did I wanted to do and

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,739
didn't have much time to do before with

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:52,950
what kind of a for-profit profession and

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,410
so I'm enjoying that now I do think that

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,959
a goal of any good open source project

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,170
is where for one it should have goals

00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,910
and once those goals are met it's not

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,069
like a product that you keep adding on

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,989
to it has a kind of a defined purpose

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:10,590
and at some point it'll meet up that

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:14,329
purpose and all you really need to do

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:18,269
after that is kind of make it faster or

00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:21,750
make it smaller or just the fixed bug so

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:24,739
I'm not sure I see a lot to do in close

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,320
future before it gets to that point but

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,070
eventually it'll get to that point and

00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,310
eventually I'd like to start another

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:35,640
company um yeah so this first time I

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,790
I've been in Argentina in Buenos Aires

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,920
my second time in Latin America on so I

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,490
don't know that much about it I do know

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,400
you got

00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,560
have really good food I like I'm almost

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,560
a carnivore and that I eat a lot of meat

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,010
and I don't like vegetables so I was one

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,220
of those kids I had one of the best

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:59,010
meals in my life yesterday last for

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,820
dinner we're just ate like four five

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:05,610
hours the red meat was non-stop and wine

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,040
and that was that was amazing so I would

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:11,850
love to see Argentina and Buenos Aires

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:15,630
continue that I think JavaScript I i

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:17,340
I've actually been I've been surprised

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,120
by what I've been able to learn at this

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:24,600
conference like you know I guess I like

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,490
as someone that is speaking here I guess

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,870
I kind of feel like on average two

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,060
speakers know a little more than the

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,940
attendees but even I was learning a lot

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,850
and I think it's very JavaScript

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:42,390
basically I mean it's kind of it has an

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:45,240
unavoidably important future because I

00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,770
mean it's what everyone it's the one

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,120
language that you can use on the front

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:55,320
end so I be very I was very excited

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,140
about kind of the things in es6 that was

00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,790
being talked about and I think that

00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,950
actually raised a lot of questions were

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:07,560
a lot of stuff like coffee script that I

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:09,330
was using another typescript etc there's

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,740
more questions about those types of

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,970
things but I think JavaScript

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,270
undoubtedly has a very important part in

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,900
what

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,900
