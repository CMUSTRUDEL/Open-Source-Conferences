Title: TDCD: Test Driven Component Development - Tim Doherty - JSConf US 2019

Description: 
	Do you test your React components? I thought not, but why not? Often developers just don’t know how. CSS is hard. HTML is hard, JavaScript is hard. Conflating CSS, HTML, and JavaScript is exponentially harder. TDD can help! Learn how to drive a component's behavior, agnostic of presentational concerns, with tests. Learn how to focus on the look and feel once you have a passing test suite. Learn that it’s possible to build and verify an entire web application, before even looking at it in a browser.

Join me as I share a technique that has fundamentally changed how I build React Applications.
