Publication date: 2019-09-11
Playlist: JSConf US 2019
Description: 
	The year is 2019, and accessibility is not a buzzword anymore. It's now imperative that information is readily available to everyone, regardless of their disability or financial status.

In this talk, you'll find out how to create accessible real-life objects, using run-of-the-mill JavaScript and the basic principles of Internet of Things.

so hello everyone

00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:15,570
Theodore engineer in an applicant

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,310
tracking system called workable you can

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,699
find me online with under the nickname

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,800
wordless and I flew my way here from

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,840
Athens Greece actually the verse from

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,910
the very same neighborhood the current

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,570
aim and being the people air Jensen

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,369
takubo was born and raised so today I'm

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,079
super excited to be with you because I

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,059
have the chance to talk to you about one

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,190
of the most interesting projects that I

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,660
have ever had the chance to work with so

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,110
today we're gonna talk about how

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,270
JavaScript and accessibility can can be

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,160
used in real-life situations

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,039
before we start though it's really

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,989
important to take a step back and take a

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,510
look her community has evolved over the

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,760
past few years we are extremely

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,859
extremely blessed to have so many great

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,320
people among us

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,070
people that have actually broaden our

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,260
aspects and our vision so we can talk

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:15,180
beyond code so we can talk about human

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:18,990
rights about inclusivity and more often

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,659
about accessibility so what's

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,009
accessibility all about if we take a

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,869
look at the dictionary term of

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,420
accessibility we will find out that

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,329
accessibility fair or refers to all

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,909
these actions we have to take in order

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:36,000
to create products environments or

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,430
systems accessible to everyone as far as

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,070
we concerned those software engineers

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,770
web developers web designers we are

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,409
mostly focused into creating accessible

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,140
communication systems like we want to

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,600
communicate with our end-users so we are

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,030
using semantic hTML we are integrating

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,060
external software like screen readers or

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,430
external hardware you will be very

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,320
surprised though if I tell you that the

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,590
very first accessible communication

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:09,810
system was introduced nearly 200 years

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,400
ago so this is loose bright bright was

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,170
born and raised in a small city outside

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,060
of Paris in the early nineteen

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,500
chewing and as a child he suffered a

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,470
terrible accident that left him

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,739
completely blind from both his eyes but

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,260
still he has managed to excel his

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,420
education and finally got accepted at

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,970
the national institution for blind youth

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,380
in Paris it was back then where she

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,270
found out that the reading and writing

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,670
system used by visually impaired people

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,030
back in the days were how can I say bit

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,580
absurd so people who are using brush

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,220
strokes trying to create and boast

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,720
letters trying to recreate the alphabet

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,760
used by the sighted people

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:54,480
so at the age of 15 yeah 15 she created

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,940
the famous brag system brag is a tactile

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,819
system it actually it's actually the

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,890
very first binary encoding system ever

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,280
made so we can actually say that Bragg

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:10,860
was the great-grandfather of computer

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,980
science right so usually bright comes in

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,069
to a shape of six positions and the

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,079
system encodes characters letters or

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:22,260
symbols using combinations of raised

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,959
dots and spaces in its very first form a

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,859
sly a slate and stylus were used in

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,720
order to allow people to write and brag

00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:33,320
so the readers can use their fingers

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,090
their fingertips trace down the letters

00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,570
combine them creating words sentences

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,430
and so on brag system quotes good it was

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,280
actually so good that hasn't literally

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,500
changed since its birth as we speak brag

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,859
is translated more than 200 languages

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:55,650
and has found applications from math to

00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:59,239
music composition and so on okay

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,459
so soon after Bragg's death typographers

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:06,510
used heavy weight paper and make endless

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,750
type sets and books and brags get start

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,959
getting out in public

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:15,180
soon after in the early 20th century

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,220
typewriters were invited so modified rag

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,229
typewriters allowed the gives provided

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,229
the users with a semi-automatic way of

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:23,640
writing break by the way the happy

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,620
typing lady you can see in the video

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,010
this is

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:31,190
Keller Helen Keller was a famous

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,990
American author and activist about human

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,720
rights for people with disabilities and

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,229
also the very first blind deaf person

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,120
that has managed to graduate college

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:43,760
Buckner's third line the last person in

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,540
our puzzle was introduced in the late

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,970
1990s 1919 so this retro-looking devices

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:53,000
are called a refreshable blog this place

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,669
as you can see in the bottom the bottom

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,740
device there like a fixed set of bragg

00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:00,380
cells brake artists are also known as

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,030
bright cells so the users can load text

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,389
or they can pair these devices with

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:12,979
external hardware like laptops or mobile

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:14,750
phones so let's recap the year is 2019

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,139
organizations and individuals

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,630
individuals are raising concerns about

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:22,850
literacy rates over around the globe we

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,490
have the tools we have the assets we

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,470
have the mindset we have this system

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,410
that actually works for so long

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:33,770
so someone could say that we're good in

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,650
a really good shape right well actually

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,919
wrong numbers and statistics ours are

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:44,870
heartbreaking I called according to the

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:47,150
world World Health Organization 2253

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,669
million people are living with visual

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,270
impairment all around the globe most of

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:57,710
them are suffering poetry or living

00:05:52,270 --> 00:06:02,570
within war zones only 10% of these

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:04,820
people can have access to be appropriate

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,099
education material or even a chance to

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:10,160
get a job and someone could say that

00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:11,780
cannot relate with within these numbers

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,030
right so we're talking about developing

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,360
countries or I don't know people living

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:20,330
in Syria or Libya right bear with me for

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,090
a moment according to the National

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:26,030
Federation of the blind

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:28,430
90% of visually impaired children living

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,310
in the state are not capable of reading

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,200
and writing because they're not being

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,650
taught brag or a given access to a

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,650
proper educational material just to give

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,960
you a perspective

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,360
about how low these numbers are I'm

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,419
gonna compare them against the literacy

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,389
rate of Ethiopia Ethiopia is a country

00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:50,790
that has suffered poetry and civil war

00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:54,090
for more than 30 years but still fifty

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:56,160
percent of the citizens of Theo Pia are

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,410
capable of reading and writing the most

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,840
important fact about these numbers is

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,060
the fact that these numbers are

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,510
increasing as we speak year by year but

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,050
still bright literacy rates for excuse

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,690
me

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:12,449
literacy literacy rates for visually

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:16,530
impaired people living in the States are

00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:18,660
stuck since the 70s and we have to think

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:23,460
ourselves what did we do so wrong so

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:25,199
what actually causes this disaster as a

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,440
matter of fact we're lucky enough we're

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,930
lacking of assets so books brilliantly

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,580
brag are like super expensive that cost

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,639
three to eight times higher than a

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,470
regular book and also just 1% of the

00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,010
available books are also available for

00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:42,840
bribe professor will brag this place are

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,280
like super expensive they cost five

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,710
hundred to eight thousand dollars

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,310
depending on the number of the cells

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,450
provided and last but not least

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,599
typewriters are super expensive as well

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,950
and although the typewriting acknowledge

00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,530
its a bit observing people are still

00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,360
using them because they're like a more

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,160
appropriate way and they provide the

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,360
users with a more delicate way of

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,180
writing brag and now imagine that

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,310
someone hunched give this problem like

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,229
he was a member of the JavaScript

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,590
community is there anything that we can

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:19,020
do in order to help these people when I

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,669
first tried to test myself break I was

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,860
stuck with this problem like lot and I

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:26,729
thought think about I keep thinking

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,849
about the like a lot so I have decided

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:31,800
to trying creating a device advice that

00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:34,770
we could actually try to mimic how

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,650
refreshable break this place work so I

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,680
want to try small maybe starting with a

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:43,790
single bright cell and maybe scaling up

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,610
as the person as my prototype could

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:49,200
start taking shape before we start

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,510
though have to set up some goals right

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,970
so since I had no prior

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,930
experience with hardware or embedded

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,270
development

00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,880
I wanted my advice to be as simple as

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,340
possible obviously it has to be

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,900
accessible to everyone and finally I

00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:08,220
want to make my device as simple as

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,990
possible but how we start is it even

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,320
possible for software engineers like me

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:17,400
to prototype hardware device apparently

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,320
piece we're gonna accelerate that our

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,030
development process using a piece of

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,310
technology called micro controllers so

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:26,060
micro controllers for those that are not

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,260
familiar with the subject are like tiny

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,490
computational units they're usually

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:34,230
coming into the shape of a board they're

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,410
relatively cheap and easy to get our

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:40,440
hands on Arduinos raspberry PI's photon

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:44,340
just name a few so for the purpose of

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,980
this experiment I have decided to one to

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,110
stick with one of the most famous one

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:52,170
Arduino Uno I purchased mine online from

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,450
like a couple bucks as you can see the

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,690
board has pins popping out from the

00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,850
device so labeled with numbers so we can

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,740
actually expand the functionality of the

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,340
board just by attaching or detaching

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,140
external modules sensors and so on so

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,230
for the purposes of this experiment I

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:14,030
want to start coding and experimenting I

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:17,310
will try the hello world hello world the

00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,710
project of hardware development like

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:24,240
flashing an LED light so I have attached

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:28,230
an LED on pin labeled 13 and the ground

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,290
just power up the LED but how can we

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,180
code a development board so they are

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,720
doing a comes with an IDE called the

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:39,320
Arduino IDE obviously and we can use C

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,840
code just to write code for the device

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,550
assemble piece of code for flattened LED

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,780
would look like this so we're

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:50,790
initializing the pin labeled 13th we are

00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,470
doing of house building functions like

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,680
the setup function show we're setting

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:58,500
the the appropriate pin as an output and

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,840
it has also a loop function that runs

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,660
all the time so we're gonna blast the

00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:07,320
LED look high and low using a delay

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:10,710
of 500 milliseconds and that piece of

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,690
code actually works but as I was trying

00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,090
and experimenting with different modules

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:19,440
and I was trying to integrate my device

00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:21,360
with maybe a web interface

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,790
I found myself stuck just be honest with

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,360
you haven't written C since my college

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,530
years so it was really hard and luckily

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,970
there was stumped up on the project

00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,390
called John 5

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,250
so John fives an ID in a platform

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:40,230
developed by Canadian company called Bo

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:43,950
coop that allows us to write JavaScript

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,990
code no Jes code for microcontrollers in

00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,750
some cases like the raspberry PI's we

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,340
can create standalone prototypes in our

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,040
case using the Arduino we can actually

00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,930
remotely johnny-five creates a think

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,700
lines so we can actually remotely

00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:00,420
control the device from our development

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,730
machine and we can actually rewrite the

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,190
flashing example the flashing LED

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:08,220
example just like including the

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:10,680
johnny-five module initializing a new

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,990
board and using the callback when the

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,680
board is ready we're going to flash the

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:20,880
LED using the blink LED the blinking LED

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,190
function and I can barely hear some of

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,650
you whispering what's wrong with this

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,240
with this guy why does he want to write

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,590
JavaScript for a freaking

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,900
microcontroller okay

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:35,880
when JavaScript was born it was the

00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,850
implementation was how can say a bit

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,640
naive so we will use JavaScript as an

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,930
event-driven programming language and

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,790
this thing actually works the same

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:48,350
concepts work for microcontrollers

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:50,340
you're gonna integrate external external

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,530
components with your device so you're

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,960
gonna you have to listen for buttons

00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,850
clicking or flashing LED and so on and

00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,320
JavaScript feels way too natural to

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:03,540
program these boards also you can use

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,840
the registry we can use whatever is on

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,280
the registry and enhance our development

00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,860
experience so we can use loaders for

00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,950
utilities you can use the Bluetooth API

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,230
web service whatever you can imagine if

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,730
we can bring the same experience from

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,550
the web

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,740
to the micro controllers also

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,260
portability it's a real thing

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,510
so even within the same family like they

00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,170
are doing a family we have different

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:32,449
software and hardware specs from device

00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:34,040
to device so they are do know is totally

00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:36,170
different from the Arduino none of the

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,910
Arduino mega and so on but we can use

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,199
the same code for different devices and

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:44,089
that's actually awesome

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:47,240
and finally least but not last we have

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,949
to admit that it's in our DNA we are

00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,350
trying to run JavaScript actually

00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:56,360
everywhere so we want to make developers

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:58,550
have using JavaScript giving them the

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,970
ability to actually create products from

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,740
the web for the web for the server for

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,110
mobile devices smartwatches

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:10,550
so when not giving them the ability to

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:13,880
run code for a microcontroller right and

00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:16,010
next up that was really rough period I

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,889
had to teach myself using something like

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:23,750
a 3d design software so that piece of

00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:26,500
hardware that looks like a blue lasagna

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:29,569
that's a brag sell my original idea

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,660
please don't judge so my original idea

00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:33,949
was that I could somehow create

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,079
individual bright cells that could be

00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:39,410
easily attached or detached with the

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:43,760
device since this was a prototyping

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:46,430
period I could I used my own 3d printers

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,529
so it was really relatively easy to

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:53,600
design something evaluate the design and

00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:56,779
keep the process going on and finally we

00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,380
have to think how are you gonna actually

00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:04,069
pop up in how can we translate data to

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:07,010
motion so as I kept experimenting with

00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:10,519
different modules I have decided to

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:13,040
stick up with this little fellow this is

00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:16,490
called the solenoid so solenoids are

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,130
like tiny push and pull actuators they

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:22,100
have a tiny electromagnet inside they

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:25,220
are actually used for watering systems

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,829
or electronic lock so using six

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,630
solenoids combined I can create a brake

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:30,140
cell since they're like six positions

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,160
per

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,480
CEL I purchased mine I purchased a bunch

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,110
of them for like a couple of bucks

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:42,230
online and finally we can bring

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:45,410
everything together so first things

00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:49,130
first we have to think how we can

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:51,650
actually encode text brags so taking up

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:55,510
the alphabet numbers and symbols as you

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:59,330
can see we've done allocate an array of

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:04,210
six positions so zeros stand for Adel

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:07,130
pins and once stand for rest pins

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:09,110
unfortunately the brag alphabet ins is

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,760
not deterministic so we have to actually

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,510
create a map of all the available

00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,240
characters letters and symbols and

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,890
afterwards we can create a symbol

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,810
utility function that takes up a

00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:25,910
character as a single parameter and

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:28,750
turns the brag representation next up we

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:31,820
can create a really simple class that's

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,250
cell class in the constructor we are

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,930
using the allocated pin so we want six

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:40,070
pins from the board in order to control

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:42,830
it solenoid so we're using six pins as

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:45,380
an argument for the constructor and the

00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,690
journey 5 instance and finally using a

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:51,230
private method that accepts a single

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:53,690
argument we can decide we can look

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,900
through the through the array of the

00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:00,890
race the middle pins and decide if pin

00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:04,310
is up or it's down so the this class is

00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:06,920
stateful so we don't have to we don't

00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:11,209
have to reset the pins it's time the

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:13,490
characters change and finally our main

00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,530
product would look like this we're

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:19,220
including the 25 module we're including

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,839
the cell class we're initializing the

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,120
board and one of the board is ready

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,720
we're creating a new instance of the

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,870
brake cell using just six pins as an as

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,230
arguments and finally printing out the

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:38,090
character a so I think most of you are

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:41,380
quite bored right now so why not bring

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,380
up a live demo for you

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:53,700
okay let me break down the slide a bit

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:57,240
so as you can see I have here I have

00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,100
life in from my camera this just be

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,870
honest with you this is my very first

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,220
time in the state and I got really

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,850
scared of getting detained at the

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:08,580
airport so so I had to break down a

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:11,730
device and I just bring with blood with

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,730
me a single character so my

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:19,770
interpretation runs using javascript and

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:21,510
HTML in my browser so um I have a live

00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:24,570
feed from my camera on the right side on

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,880
the left side I have I'm using a

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,169
brilliant typeface called bright knowing

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,970
which will give you a visual

00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:33,570
representation of the characters pretty

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:35,760
doubt and using the input text field on

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:40,350
the top I can write something and print

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:43,020
out print it out from the device just

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,360
like that so let's try to write

00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:57,289
something meaningful rather than hello

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:57,289
world okay cross your fingers

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:57,750
thank you so much so apparently our

00:19:52,710 --> 00:20:00,480
prototype works it works have every

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:04,230
single time I promise you so let's bring

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,400
up some results as you can see I had no

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,700
prior experience with embedded

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,950
development but the embedded development

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,220
her family as well as the JavaScript

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:17,120
community are really helpful so building

00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,220
up this device was relatively stable no

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,840
sophisticated coding no sophisticated

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,480
modules everything was purchased from

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:31,140
online so we can say we have achieved

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:33,840
that goal next up we can actually expand

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,730
this device so based on the number of

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,669
pins provided by the device we can

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:42,750
expire we can attach or detach browsers

00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:48,690
on demand and finally we can bring up to

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:55,350
12 cells just for 40 bucks so we have to

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:57,240
think ourselves oh sorry what's next so

00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,880
I wish as we speak I'm trying to

00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:05,549
improvise the device I'm working on the

00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:08,850
second version and I'm trying actually

00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:13,260
to improve the design and get feedback

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:15,600
from from static groups from people that

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:20,070
could actually use this device in order

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,620
to learn bright also so naturally

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:26,669
beautiful prototyping but they're a bit

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:30,210
clunky and they're energy inefficient so

00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:32,130
I think we can improve the design using

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,830
a piece of module called micro snipers

00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:38,250
these are tiny tiny stepper modules that

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:41,429
are used in controlling camera lenses or

00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:44,220
DVD Drive so we can actually recycle old

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:47,669
parts and improve the design using a

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,900
bunch of them and finally using micro

00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:54,360
stepper motors we can bring we can

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:59,460
improve we can actually reduce the cost

00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:01,860
of the actual device finally I think

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,770
people can use this same piece of

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:07,230
technology and create their own devices

00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:09,450
like attach creating something like a

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,850
weather station for people that need to

00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:14,640
know that weather using sensors modules

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:17,700
and so on and actually you can go beyond

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,030
25 and try different frameworks like

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:24,660
this premium one which is actually

00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:29,460
project that runs JavaScript in the

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:31,650
microcontroller and for the past one

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,360
year and a half I kept dot I keep

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:37,280
talking and presenting this device to

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,660
people and I keep thinking I have

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,490
different talks with some colleagues of

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,240
mine and people that I meet at various

00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:47,670
meetups and conferences and I have

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,420
thought about maybe trying to seek for

00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:53,490
funding or raising crowds crowdfunding

00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,740
campaign because I want more people to

00:22:53,490 --> 00:23:01,380
have the ability to use this device and

00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:04,620
actually help people but instead wanna

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,290
ask for your help so the entire

00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,210
prototype is open-source and you can

00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:12,000
find it online you can actually build

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,100
this device for yourself for yourselves

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,020
I think it's a great project to get you

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,070
started with the IOT world in the

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,690
upcoming months we I'm planning of

00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:24,420
delivering the very first bright

00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,610
open-source bright britain printer that

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,530
runs JavaScript as well so we're

00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:33,750
experimenting with some wearables so

00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:36,690
great things to come and I actually

00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:42,630
think that we as the JavaScript

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:45,720
community we can do more so somehow we

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:48,090
do actually care and we are now openly

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,160
speaking about things that actually

00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:54,450
matter this beyond the digital world and

00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,090
if there's something that you can take

00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:01,440
away from this presentation is the fact

00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:03,660
that we are we have power in numbers

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,350
and we can actually really raise

00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:10,560
awareness and at the at the very end we

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:12,180
can somehow affect the world thank you

00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,700
so much for your time and patience

00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:28,999
[Applause]

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:28,999
