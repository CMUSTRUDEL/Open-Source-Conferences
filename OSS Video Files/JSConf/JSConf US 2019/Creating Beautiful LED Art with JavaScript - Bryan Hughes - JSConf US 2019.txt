Title: Creating Beautiful LED Art with JavaScript - Bryan Hughes - JSConf US 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-12
Playlist: JSConf US 2019
Description: 
	More and more art incorporates LEDs these days, and for good reason. They're eye-catching and can be controlled cheaply by a Raspberry Pi.

The question of course is: how do we animate them from JavaScript? The answer is more complicated than just figuring out how to turn LEDs on and off. Animating LEDs smoothly requires math!

This talk will dive into the theory and practice of using different color spaces combined with some clever math to create beautiful LED animations for your JavaScript-powered art piece.

Creating Beautiful LED Art with JavaScript

00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,160
Bryan Hughes

00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,160
PARISS: All right, everyone.

00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,160
We're back.

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,160
How is everyone feeling?

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,160
Really?

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,160
How is everyone feel something [ Applause ]

00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,160
Much better.

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,160
All right.

00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
So, for our next speaker, they'll be speaking about creating beautiful LED art with JavaScript.

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
This is really beautiful right here.

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Can we give it up for Bryan Hughes?

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
[ Applause ] BRYAN: Thanks, everyone.

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,160
LED art is something I'm pretty passionate about.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,812
I got involved doing this three years ago for various festivals and things of that nature.

00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:20,870
I wanted to talk about it because I think there's a lot of cool stuff here.

00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,800
By the way, I have a lot of resources to go along with this talk.

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,539
You can find it at the URL at the bottom of this slide.

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,730
And don't worry, this URL will also be on the side of most of the other slides in the

00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,980
presentation.

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,870
So, like LED art is something that I find really fascinating in a lot of ways.

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,989
Because it really is a hybrid of technologies, specifically technology that we already tend

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:45,060
to know, and art.

00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,400
And I think there's a lot of misconceptions about what art really is.

00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,300
We tend to think of it as this world that's just completely separate from technology.

00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,110
We kind of view them as having no overlap whatsoever.

00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,110
But I don't think that's true.

00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,280
I think there's actually quite a bit of overlap.

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,661
Because when we really dig into it, art is quite technical, when you look at it.

00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:07,260
We just don't see or think of that.

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,130
But it really is.

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,640
For example, have you ever looked at how paints actually work?

00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,630
We ought to think of painting as one of the sort of classic arts and we think of it as

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,780
an artistic medium.

00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,670
When we look at how paints work, they are deeply technical.

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,090
There are all sorts of different types of paints that have different effects, cure differently,

00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,710
different textures, different material properties.

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,700
There's different ways you can mix them, different ways they age.

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,550
There's science behind paint.

00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,290
There's a lot of technology behind paints.

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,020
And this is true of most art that's out there.

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,580
There's quite a bit of technology.

00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,300
People who create art are really good at their craft.

00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,460
They're really good at the technology of their arts.

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,960
But there's still a difference.

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,700
We do classify these as different things for a reason.

00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,060
So, why is that?

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,531
So, the question of what is art, how do we define art?

00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:05,090
That's one of those questions that's sort of puzzled philosophers for pretty much all

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,670
of human history.

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,330
And I don't have to claim to have an answer to that question in its entirety.

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,460
But I do have one small claim to make to sort of get at the edges.

00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:22,550
What I would say about art is that we create art by using technology to express emotional

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,360
truth.

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,810
And this is what separates art from the typical ways that we use technology.

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,690
And what we think of as technology.

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,030
Because in the case of technology, or in our case what we think of as technology is really

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,520
we're thinking about products.

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,310
We're thinking about using technology to create a product, usually with the intention of generating

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,310
a profit.

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:50,580
Or perhaps with users in theory, some magic Silicon Valley math generates revenue.

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,670
But we have a concept of revenue at the end of the day that drives it.

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,590
And with art, there really isn't that concept.

00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,790
Our business is a weird thing.

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,570
We're going to set that aside for a moment.

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,050
But with art, we're not trying to create revenue.

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,360
That's not our intention.

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,540
Our intention is to express truth about ourselves or the society or the world.

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,760
It's kind of an inward look and taking it out.

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,490
And we express this outside for what is inside of ourselves.

00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,260
The way we do that, we first have to master our craft.

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,700
We have to understand the basics of what we do.

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:32,060
And for LED art specific, like this piece here, there's some technology that goes behind

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,350
it.

00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,530
And so, the first thing I want to talk about, I want to talk about how we can create visualizations

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,200
that look kind of like this.

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,350
And we have to start by talking about color.

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,540
And color spaces.

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,350
And specifically I want to talk about the HSV color space.

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,130
Which is the hue saturation value is what the acronym stands for, color space.

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,330
This is very similar to one you might have seen on the web, HSL, hue saturation luminous.

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,599
They're almost the same, there's a tiny difference to them.

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,200
But this is pretty important for understanding color and especially for doing art with it.

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,420
And to explain why we need this, first let's talk about RGB.

00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,070
We all know what RGB is, red green blue.

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,610
We express it in the space in terms of how much red is in it, how much green and how

00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:24,100
much blue and they add together to create color.

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,850
We use this model because RGB is mechanically how we create color and work with color with

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,310
various visual devices.

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,150
So, for example, with these LEDs, the way we create a specific color and hue is actually

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,520
three LEDs embedded in it, red, green and blue.

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,520
And we change how bright those three are to create any color.

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,270
Same with LED screens, projectors and anything we can think that have creates a visual device.

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,900
In fact the oldest RGB device is our eyes themselves.

00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,300
We have three nerves that are light sensitive.

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,430
And specifically sensitive to relatively narrow ranges of light.

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,380
One towards green, one towards red, one towards blue.

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,680
RGB isvery important.

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,930
We user it for color production and color sensing, it's a mechanical thing.

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,960
But it's not how we think about color.

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,410
We look at my pants.

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,210
I don't look at this and see equal amounts of red, green and blue.

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,430
That's not what I'm thinking.

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,060
I see white.

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,310
Right?

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,230
We don't think in terms of color of RGB.

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,820
This is where HSV is really, really useful.

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,870
Because HSV expresses how we think about color.

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,410
So, to illustrate that, let's talk about it a little bit.

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,500
Let's talk about hue first.

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,840
So, hue is kind of like the base color in a lot of ways.

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,560
We measure this in degrees from zero to 360.

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,139
There's mathematical reasons, graphs, coordinates, whatever.

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,090
We're not going to talk about that.

00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,810
This represents sort of the spectrum of color and spectrums.

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:07,479
The color there is are similar to the colors from the hue here.

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:08,800
Same thing with a rainbow.

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,460
We can start at zero degrees.

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,140
And at 360 degrees, by the way, same as zero degrees, circle.

00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,770
And we get a red color.

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,870
But then we go in and shift the hue around a little bit and we can see the color changes.

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,750
We've gone up a little bit.

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,810
Oh, that's not great.

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,080
[ Laughter ] And so, like, we get a little bit of a color

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
there.

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
We can shift it further.

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,330
We get a blue color.

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,460
We kind of go further, we get a purple.

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,020
And then eventually we come back around to red.

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,940
And so, this is what hue is.

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,580
It's sort of like a base color.

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,800
Sort of a primary color in a lot of ways.

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,080
So, the next step we have is saturation and saturation is kind of like basically how washed

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,160
out is this color?

00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,000
If you've ever done any sort of image editing using Photoshop or light room, you'll notice

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,419
a saturation slider.

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,770
You bump it up to make it more colorful.

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,630
This is what it's doing under the hood, messing with the color space.

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,169
At 100%, saturation is measured from zero to 100%.

00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:13,860
100%, this is full color.

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,740
This is as much color as you can get.

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,820
Here we have this fire engine red kind of color.

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,170
We start to drop that down and we see it getting just a little lighter.

00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,600
Starts to turn into sort of a pinkish.

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,440
It's not really a vibrant red anymore.

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,680
It's lacking vibrancy.

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,669
And we keep going all the way to zero.

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,270
And eventually we end up with white.

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,190
There's a complete lack of color.

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:43,380
In fact, taking the saturation to zero on any color will give us white as it turns out.

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,919
Now, similar to saturation is the value.

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,139
And in a sort of it's actually mathematically related.

00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,550
We're not going talk about the math too much.

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,380
But we think of it as how bright is the color.

00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,800
Again, we have this really bright colored red.

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,610
But as we start to drop this value from 100% to zero, we see it just getting dimmer and

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,380
we're sort of getting a maroon color at about 50%.

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,560
We take it all the way and then we can get to black.

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,311
And so, these are the three channels that make up hue, saturation, and value on a color

00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:17,311
space.

00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:20,180
We put it together, we can create anything we want.

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,690
Say we want to create a lilac sort of color.

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,690
That light purple.

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,900
My hair is purple, I love purple.

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,050
Purple, I happen to remember, is kind of over here.

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,909
But if I didn't remember where purple was, there's not that much to go through.

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,929
Mess with the slider, find the color you want.

00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,929
This is the base color.

00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,789
But this isn't a lilac.

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,350
Lilac is a fairly washed out color.

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,550
That tells you that we need to drop the saturation on that.

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:55,429
We will take the saturation and put it over here and thus we have a lilac color.

00:08:55,429 --> 00:09:00,339
So, we've got that, we mess with hue and saturation.

00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,190
But then the next thing we can do is we can just make it, you know, darker if we want

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,190
to.

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,190
We can make it dimmer.

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,910
Let's say we're having two color themes for a -- we're doing a light and a dark.

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,749
The nice thing about the color space, we can take different colors and make them brighter

00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,990
and darker, but they are the same color.

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,420
It's dark colored, but it's the same thing.

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,800
They're super, super related and all the I'm doing is changing one number.

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,850
in RGB we have to change it.

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:38,120
I have no idea what this is in RGB because we can't reason about RGB.

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,970
But we can about HSV.

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,910
And so, this is a great thing.

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,709
Like HSV color space provides a really great sort of foundation to start doing any sort

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,610
of color work in art especially but even in products too.

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:56,279
HSV is sort of a universally useful color space, I think.

00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,070
But that alone isn't enough to get us an animation.

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,800
So, how do we get to something like that?

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,509
Well, this is where we do a little bit of math.

00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:10,579
Now, not particularly complicated math.

00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:16,170
This is like middle school trig level, not advanced calculus or anything.

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,739
We'll do a review because, you know, middle school was a long time ago.

00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:28,949
So, it turns out we can do all kinds of animation using sinewaves.

00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:31,540
This is the full formulation.

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,879
Sometimes we see an abbreviated one.

00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,649
But this is all of it.

00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:37,329
We have a function.

00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,440
This is sort of our output.

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,449
We have an output that is some function of a variable that's an input.

00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:48,260
For now, it's abstract, call it T. This could be distance.

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:54,069
It could be we pass in say the value zero for the first LED, 1 for the next, 2, so on

00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:55,579
and so forth.

00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,999
It's a function argument just like we have in code and so, then the output is going to

00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:08,550
be A times the sine of omega t plus phi plus V. What do all the variables do?

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,619
Start with omega.

00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:14,769
Omega is what's called the angular frequency.

00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:15,769
Sounds kind of technical.

00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,899
But essentially what that means is how fast or slow is our sine wave?

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:23,920
Right now we have an Omega value of 1.

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,749
But we miss it with, start to increase, we can see our sine wave starts to get busier.

00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:33,600
It just starts getting faster and faster.

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,850
So, next up we have phi, this is the other part in the sine wave.

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,170
This is an offset.

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,389
Where does the sine wave start?

00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:50,759
We mess with this and we see that sine wave sliding around on the screen of it.

00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,880
I don't use it myself, but I want to include it for completeness sake.

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,029
Then next up we have A, which is kind of a scaling factor for the sine wave.

00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:03,350
Right now this is going from negative 1 to 1.

00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,269
But if we dropped this to, say, 0.5, we could see this gets a little thinner.

00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,779
And it's not as tall of a sine wave.

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:16,989
And then last up we have the and this issort of a final offset, like a constant offset

00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:23,160
and which allows us to shift our sine wave around the graph like this.

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,680
With these parameters, we can combine them to create all kinds of stuff.

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,670
Now, there's some interesting things that happen at edges, sort of the edge cases to

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,670
this.

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,679
So, for example, I'm going to scoot this you were a bit, let's say we drop our angular

00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,399
frequency all the way to zero.

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,769
We do that, it's getting slower and slower.

00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,709
Eventually we just get a straight line.

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:53,189
And this can be useful if we ever need to do something constant or unchanging.

00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,100
But there's another way that we can achieve this too, though.

00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,819
We can also take A, you know, that scaling factor of the sine wave, and drop it to zero.

00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:01,819
And we also get a straight line.

00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:07,989
Once we have done that, we get the straight line, we can use B to increase or decrease

00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:09,899
how strong it is.

00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,799
So, you can think of B as sort of an overall brightness for constant, and A is an overall

00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,860
constant for the changes.

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,910
How does this map to LEDs and color spaces?

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,069
Well, basically like this.

00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,540
So, here we have thatexact same formula.

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,079
Instead of F and T, I say color value of X.

00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:38,949
What this is saying is we have a color, the value channel in HSV, that value, that channel,

00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:41,449
we're going to set if based on the sine wave.

00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:44,970
And it's going to be a function of X which is distance, again, which LED are we talking

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,970
about here.

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,310
So, we can see at the bottom we have kind of what the LED output looks like.

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,439
When we vary the value across the distance according to the sine wave.

00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:59,670
And the software powering the LEDs on the screen, a lot of it is shared with the power

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,670
here.

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,670
It's sharing the same thing.

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,769
By the way, it's really fun.

00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:07,059
And really hard.

00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:11,910
So, we can go in and we can change the angular frequency and according to distance and if

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,929
we increase this, we can see we start to get these tiny little waves.

00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:17,670
Like almost just a couple of dots.

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,790
But then as we spread it out, we can see them getting longer and longer.

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,060
And eventually we end up with just a flat line.

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,510
Now, there's still a little bit of color here.

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,550
You might be wondering why that is.

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,899
So, well a perfect sine wave, this is essentially like floating point math.

00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,769
These are floating numbers between negative 1&1.

00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:44,699
But a colored space, including HSV, we have a value that's been zero and 100% which under

00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:49,029
the hood is represented as zero to 255 just like RGB.

00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:50,490
We have to map those.

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,989
The way I set this up is so that negative 1 is equal to 0% and positive 1 is equal to

00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:57,499
100%.

00:14:57,499 --> 00:15:01,360
Right now we're at basically 50% brightness and this is a flat line.

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,240
We can use B to make this bright.

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,029
About as bright as it can get and also turn it completely off.

00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:10,519
And it's a weird thresholding.

00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,720
It's actually a little bit weird.

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,260
But nonetheless, we can still do all of this kind of work.

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:23,809
We can control how the LEDs work in across distance and we can also make it uniform.

00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:27,879
Now, what if we decided to set value as a function of another variable.

00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,459
I mentioned distance as one, but we can do it for something else.

00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:34,660
Let's make it a function of time.

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,929
With time, we get something a that looks like this.

00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:42,800
We can see I have where the current marker in time is shifting across the graph.

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,359
Again, positive 1 is 100%, negative 1 is zero.

00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:50,529
You can see the lovely fading in and out sort of animation.

00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,329
Again, it's a sine value.

00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,200
And we can change this just like before.

00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,230
We will increase the angular frequency and we get something that's flashing really fast.

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,059
And so, when I look at something like this, I'm kind of thinking like this kind of makes

00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:08,410
me think of an emergency warning light.

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,369
This is an intense animation.

00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,800
It's a little bit of anxiety producing, a little bit in your face.

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,259
So, we can use these mathematical parameters to evoke an emotional mood.

00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:27,199
We can use light in society, we have those correlations, fast, flashing red, that's a

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,199
warning sign.

00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,279
So, I can evoke a little bit of a mood just by setting a couple of sine wave parameters.

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,689
And I can also slow this way down.

00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:43,769
And so, this is just like very slowly changing over time.

00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:48,850
And if I picked another color, say, then, you know, this could be a very calming.

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,139
It's almost like a sort of breathing a little bit.

00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,049
So, we can evoke a different mood by just changing the rate on this.

00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,440
But we can effect this and do even more complicated things.

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,619
We can drop A to, say, half.

00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:06,190
And B we can bump up so that's sit up top like that.

00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,380
And here we go to full brightness with a little bit of clipping.

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,940
Let me drop that a bit.

00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,120
And down to like half.

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,000
So, it never gets fully dark.

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,720
But we could still see a changing and just sort of morphing a little bit over time.

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,950
Now, what if we made this a function about time and space?

00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,650
Turns out we can do that with this modification of the formula here.

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,180
So, now you'll notice we've added a little bit more to the sine wave.

00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,600
We have Omega T times T plus Omega X times X plus phi.

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,460
And we combined them together and we get this roving wave pattern.

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,840
With this, you can see how this is assembled in the art piece here.

00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:01,430
Yeah, we can slow this down and you can just this is barely moving across.

00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:07,140
Again, this is a very kind of soothing slow sort of animation.

00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,400
We can also make it go really fast.

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,890
This is kind of zipping across.

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,530
Now, what's interesting here though is because this does until we go away, they always see

00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,990
some light.

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,780
It's a little bit of a different mood than we had on the previous in which we were flashing

00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,250
it really fast.

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,400
It's not quite that, you know, warning, warning kind of feeling.

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,300
To me this just feels more like energy and movement.

00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,280
Again, by the tweaking of this, we can get slightly different emotional feelings out

00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,300
of it.

00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,030
And we can also, you know that's changing how fast it is.

00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:45,150
We can also change this distance and change it, again, like are they little things?

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,550
We can take this down, now it kind of makes me think of like ants marching along or something

00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,550
like that.

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,850
So, you can get some really fun stuff just by, again, tweaking some mathematical parameters.

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,230
All right.

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,030
That's how we edit the value channel and that's kind of what we can do when we're playing

00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,030
with the value.

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,400
What about the other channels?

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,800
Saturation, again, is very closely related to value in practice.

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,100
Just sort of an inverse.

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,670
Here we can see it's fading from red all the way down to white.

00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:20,120
And same thing, we could make this fade really fast or slow.

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:26,160
We can also give it how to change over distance and again we get this sort of roving

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,620
wave pattern that we saw before.

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,470
It's slightly it's a different way of doing it mathematically and gives a different effect,

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,650
but we can still do that.

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,240
And we can also do things like drop that down, bump this up.

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,080
Now we have it going from red to pink.

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,840
It's like this could be a great one to do on Valentine's Day if you celebrate that with

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,950
the red motif going on.

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:57,230
We can get different things going on by tweaking programmers in we saw saturation and value.

00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,230
What about hue?

00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,510
Hue is different.

00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,070
It's less related.

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,220
We get a different effect.

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,490
I want to start here.

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,370
We have everything set to zero.

00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,940
Nothing is changing over time.

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,700
And we have B set in the middle.

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,000
The way this is map 140 zero degrees is negative 1.

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,770
And 360 is positive 17.

00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:25,360
Right now we're at the middle, this is the light blue color.

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,200
And you will see it just shifting across the hue.

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Like we saw before.

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,600
Again, there's weird scaling I have with B. Just negative numbers with my algorithm.

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,400
But we can kind of just set this to a solid color just by changing the B value in the

00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
equation.

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,580
If we want to just set a color, this is how I do it.

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,950
But then let's start to introduce some variance over time.

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,410
Let's just increase this to 1.

00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,410
And we do that.

00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,910
Now we see it just starting to slowly cycle through all the colors.

00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,820
And in and of itself, this can be kind of an interesting animation because, you know,

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,530
we're just getting this changing sort of vibrancy.

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,720
And we could make it go slow, we can make it go fast.

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:14,040
And then we can also introduce some distance over time.

00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,800
Or we make this a function of X.

00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,870
And this is where I think this gets the most unusual as far as these equations go.

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,700
Because with this, we get this sort of like roving rainbow color.

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,540
And this can be a pretty interesting one in and of itself too because we're changing the

00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,560
hue over time.

00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,270
So, it's like we're going around that circle of hue all the way to the end.

00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,650
And the only way we can make that faster or slower.

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,060
What also gets interesting is let's say we're going to drop this down to here.

00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,620
What this is doing is sort of clamping what part of the circle we're on.

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,880
You notice we don't have the all the colors anymore.

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,060
We're not going red it to red.

00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,230
We're sticking in one part of the circle.

00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:00,340
This is gonna be, I think, maybe 120 to 180?

00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,340
Like 240 degrees?

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,340
Something like that?

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,400
We're taking like the slice of colors in the middle.

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,950
But we can shift this up and down.

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:12,120
If you shift it down, we're gonna mostly see some more colors I have that weird clipping

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
thing.

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,510
But here to the top, we're mostly in the blue purple side of the spectrum.

00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,260
So, we can sort of clamp into certain ranges of colors and not get all the colors as well

00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,520
by just tweaking a few more parameters.

00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:36,710
And so, that's how the three color we can vary the three color channels to create animations

00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,010
using sine waves.

00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,260
However, it turns out in most cases there's usually a fourth channel.

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,071
When we talk about color spaces, we pretty much talk about three chances, RGB, we talk

00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:47,350
about three.

00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,830
But in practice, there's always four.

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,820
If the fourth one is alpha or transparency.

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,720
We talk about the RGBA, or red, green, blue alpha.

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,820
We can do the same in the other color space, HSVA, hue, plus alpha.

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,620
We can add transparency to these.

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,930
Here on the next slide, I'm doing exactly that.

00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,000
In this case, it's a black background.

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,760
This looks exactly like with value.

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,780
I take parameters and we get the same thing we saw when we were tweaking value.

00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,320
But this is trans parent so it means we can put a layer underneath it, composite layers

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,110
together and put in multiple waves.

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,890
I didn't put all the controls on here, it would have been a lot.

00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:37,590
But we have the full controls are for the alpha channel on the top and the B on the

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,590
bottom.

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:44,930
And we have the roving wave, make it faster or slower, we can change the distance.

00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,280
And now I'm going to bring in the bottom layer.

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,630
The bottom layer, by the way, I have a hue of 180 degrees, a teal color.

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:58,950
As we bring this in, we start to see, we get a little bit of blue mixed under the red.

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,730
With this, we have two separate colors we have two completely separate waves doing their

00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,610
own thing layered in together.

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:12,990
And so, by the way, the full set of equations running on this looks kind of like that.

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,170
It's a lot, I know.

00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,170
It's hard to read.

00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,170
I don't like looking at it.

00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,880
Let's look at code instead.

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,600
This is a little more what we're used to.

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,700
This is a little friendlier looking.

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,600
Like, I can do this.

00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,710
In this case, it's an array of colors.

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,860
But accept instead of sending hue to a constant, we're sending it to a function.

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,760
We can tweak those parameters and then layer them together.

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,000
When we look at this piece right here, for example, there's three layers going on.

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,620
The very bottom layer is just a solid blue color.

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,310
It never changes, it's just sitting there being blue.

00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:53,440
And on top of that, another layer set to green.

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,130
But what I'm doing with that, varying the alpha over time.

00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,130
Nothing with distance.

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:04,810
Just going from fully opaque green across the strip to trans parent green.

00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,050
Fading from blue to green.

00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,490
You can see the color in there.

00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:15,260
But on top that have, then I have that sort of roving wave pattern we saw in red that

00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,820
makes it look like it's going over.

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,210
And that's how I created that animation.

00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:23,530
And I used to do this, the system, it's a little bit complex.

00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,220
But we can do all of this from JavaScript.

00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,380
This is one of the really cool things about Johnny Five and node bots and that whole world

00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,110
is we can write some code that looks like this.

00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:41,050
So, we can bring in a library called node pixel written by A.J. Fisher over there somewhere.

00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,860
And taking in Johnny Five which there's a number of collaborators here on.

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:50,490
And this node animations which I wrote, that's some of the stuff here.

00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,320
And mix them together.

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,441
And most of the code is initialization.

00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:58,830
It's import libraries, getting the node ready, and the strip.

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,160
And inside of the event, we're going to set colors.

00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,200
Create the layer.

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,380
I created a helper method.

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,080
Sometimes I don't want to use those coefficients directly.

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,480
We create an animation, create a layer.

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,280
And we composite that into a whole set of wave parameters that we have a helper method

00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
for.

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:22,980
And then from the wave parameters into a list of RGB pixels.

00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,350
And finally set each pixel in our LED using Node Pixel.

00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,810
This code is functional.

00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,430
I think it is, I didn't test it.

00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,520
What can I say?

00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,430
But this should be functional JavaScript code, a few bugs aside.

00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,290
That's not very much code to get something like this going.

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:46,640
And like this is the thing that I love about JavaScript and why this is so powerful is

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,250
that once we have this in JavaScript.

00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,880
Once we're inside of Node, which is where this is running, that opens all of the web

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,260
to us.

00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,200
Specifically, we could do something like this.

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:06,120
Now, in this case the screen that we see here isn't quite I think I can do this.

00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,640
So, most of this the slides were synced to the specific page all right.

00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
I can't show you.

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
That's all right.

00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,470
But there's a Node server running on the Raspberry Pi that I have kind of hidden behind here

00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,050
which is ultimately controlling this piece right here.

00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,050
And this is the control panel.

00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,050
This is a web app.

00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,150
You can load it this up on your mobile phone if you're connected to the Wi Fi.

00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:32,370
And we have this one animation, let's just set it to rainbow.

00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,230
Now we have we can see it cycling through the hue.

00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,510
That's a nice animation as well.

00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,470
We can make it go really fast like it's just really chugging along.

00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,530
And again, just controlling this from the web application.

00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,020
We can go there's just like a pulsing of color.

00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,380
We get that reading effect.

00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,360
I kind of like this one myself.

00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,480
We can just cycle through colors as well.

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,610
Like, you know, we have this now in a web application.

00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,610
It's open to the Internet.

00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,180
And once we have this, we can like bring people in.

00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,370
You know, we can create art pieces that encourage other people to come and interact with it.

00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,390
Like, this is one of the things I think is so exciting about a lot of art coming up these

00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,260
days is that it's interactive.

00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,760
It encourages people to engage and explore with it.

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,510
There's a lot of profound ways that we can create experiences for people.

00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,610
And so, the thing I want to come back to is where this is all about doing art.

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,680
And I want to encourage all of you to express yourself.

00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,090
Like, art is really, really important.

00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,900
And I personally think that art is the single greatest thing our species has ever created,

00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
ever.

00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,880
Like, I think art is what makes us so unique and I think it represents the best side of

00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
us.

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,550
And so, I really encourage all of you to try it out.

00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,610
You know, we have these skills, we have these technology skills.

00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:00,490
With if we just rethink how we're going to use them, we can use it to create art.

00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:05,100
Think about art, and one of the reasons I think it's so important though is it's about

00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,050
expressing emotional truth.

00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:11,290
And to do that, we have to understand ourselves.

00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:16,490
In order to express what we're feeling through art, we first have to know what we are feeling.

00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:22,900
And that may sound like a tautology or something simple, but it takes introspection.

00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:28,500
That's really, really important because it makes us better people.

00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:35,690
When we know who we really are, how we engage and fit in the world, that enables us to then

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,020
start interacting with the world in a better way.

00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:45,100
Allows us to be more honest, allows us to be more authentic and be our true selves.

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,160
It's better for us as individuals and for our relationships.

00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Create art.

00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,990
The one thing I want to leave you all with today is how can you feed your inner artist

00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,470
and not just feed capitalism?

00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,190
