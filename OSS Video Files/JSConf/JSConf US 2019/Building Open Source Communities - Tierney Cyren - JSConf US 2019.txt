Building Open Source Communities - Tierney Cyren

00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,120
>> Hello?

00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,120
Good morning, everyone!

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,120
AUDIENCE: Morning!

00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
>> Thank you!

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,120
All right, so who's ready to hear about building open source communities?

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,120
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,120
>> All right, so let's welcome Tierney Cyren.

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,120
>> Hello.

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,120
Could we give another round of applause to the organizers and the supporting staff who

00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,810
have built this amazing event that I've really had an amazing time with and I hope you have

00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,810
too.

00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,620
Awesome, OK, so today I want to talk about building open source communities.

00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,770
Before I get started, I'm going to do a quick who am I.

00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,070
My name is Tierney Cyren, my pronouns are he and him.

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,370
I work at Microsoft, I collaborate on the Node project and a number of other projects

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,750
in various different ways, that's basically what you need to know about me.

00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,719
So what is an open source community?

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,460
>> Open source is everything, or at least the community side of open source is everything

00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,699
beyond the code.

00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:58,030
So everything that's not technical, like literally writing lines of code and consuming lines

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,960
of code, is the community.

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,950
This includes people, coordinating a bunch of different aspects of your community itself,

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:20,720
processes, location, funding, social media, blogging, diversity 

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,990
and inclusivity, outreach, documentation, licensing, there's lot.

00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,800
>> I think like a year and a half ago, I asked what open source community is.

00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,460
And there was a bunch of different responses and they're all pretty good and honestly I

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,170
agree with all of them.

00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:45,780
That said, they're all pretty different, and it kind of leads us to understand that there's

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,960
not consensus around what open source community is, because it's so individual to us as individual

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,890
contributors, to us as maintainers, to us as consumers.

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,530
You have to really take into account those aspects when you're asking like such a broad

00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,170
question.

00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,829
Whatever technology you came from originally, whatever you started with, is going to influence

00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,430
how you perceive an open source community.

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,650
Whatever your personal history is going to influence how you see a community in general

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:25,920
and then you are aapplying open source definition to that of what's important to you.

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,439
Again differentiate how you'd perceive an open source community so everyone's idea is

00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,099
different of what a community is.

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,349
So taking that, how do you actually build an open source community?

00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:45,379
It's kind of challenging, but it's also very easy in a lot of ways.

00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:51,430
I generally try not to say easy, but it's -- I'm using it in in this case, because it's

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,610
easy to stumble into it and do it accidentally and this is how a lot of communities do end

00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,360
up starting.

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,220
So I'm using easy very intentionally there.

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,139
Every open source community has a lot of its own quirks and unique aspects and often those

00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,540
are really good and often those can be really bad.

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,099
Luckily, there are some fundamental traits, at least in my experience of the open source

00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:24,310
communities I've been a part of that are shared and these aren't necessarily like I can give

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,489
you XYZ answer to a problem.

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:32,659
These are kind of cultural things that are shared and kind of manifest no matter how

00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:38,180
you get to open source community evolves and builds up.

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:46,349
So let's go into some of the lessons I've personally learned from being parts of open

00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:54,680
source communities and helping them grow and also seeing them fail.

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,739
So these are the communities I participated in.

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,209
MyBB is an open source forum system.

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,019
It's been around for a very long time.

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,879
It was created in 2006, I think, 2005, which for me is a long time.

00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:15,459
It's PHP, so you know, very different from JavaScript that we're used to, and kind of

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:20,120
the build speed was a very different pace than what we're used to in JavaScript.

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,380
Tent was a protocol, the implementation was Ruby.

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,180
Whoo Ruby.

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,530
Interesting choice in this crowd!

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,910
So Tent was very much an idea and a definition similar to what HTTP is, people go implement

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:45,350
T very interesting community and one that I really loved and very sad to have seen it

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,350
die.

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:53,990
Io.js, I assume many of you know what that is, but that is the fork of node that happened

00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:03,570
in node 10 just before Node 12 shipped.

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,580
Eventually got merged into Node.js and got moved under Node.js foundation.

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,940
And then there's Node itself.

00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,229
I know these kind of merged.

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:19,000
I do absolutely classify them as two different communities and two different experiences.

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,560
And we can get into that a bit later.

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,810
So lesson one, don't build too much.

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,360
Creating too much structure can be a really bad thing that hinders your community.

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,150
Specifically it sets guardrails on how your community can grow and sets implicit expectations

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,631
about that growth, and it limits what you can do once you begin getting momentum, because

00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:46,389
people try to stay within those guardrails rather than doing something natural and probably

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,240
something that you're not going to expect.

00:05:50,240 --> 00:06:05,220
So my experience in MyBB was I created a website called techno board.net: It was a forum for

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,210
people who were interested in technology.

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,729
And I built a lot of structure, because that's how all of the forums I saw were doing it.

00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:17,200
Turns out that didn't work.

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,220
There were two forums that had a bunch of posts and al.

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,539
Rests were empty and that creates an environment where oh, I see a bunch of empty things, this

00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,860
looks dead and so I'm not going to participate.

00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:35,970
So defining those guide rails and setting up structure when it's not needed yet is actually

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:41,560
really challenging because it one, makes your community look empty, and two, it limits how

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,360
you can actually grow naturally.

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:51,259
So yeah, that's an example of how to do something that's maybe not the best, because you're

00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,340
trying to do, and you're trying to mimic what others do, and that can hamper your actual

00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,470
growth.

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:04,970
Additionally, in Node, going through the process of creating a PR and submitting it, and, you

00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,639
know, getting it merged and going through the entire process can be a little bit cumbersome

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:15,590
and can kind of feel like this, where it's just a cycle, and you know, certain groups

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,639
in Node have gotten a lot better about this.

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,530
That said, this process is also very intentional.

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,500
We do this because it's needed in a lot of cases.

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,180
Node is a very highly impactful project, and making sure that we're not letting things

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,001
slip through that shouldn't be slipping through is really important, because we don't want

00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:38,259
to create, you know, a bad experience for the end users for the people who are using

00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:43,280
this in production, for the developers like you who are using this on their machines.

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,699
So that said, in a lot of cases, if you set up too much red tape early on, it can actually

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,860
limit growth.

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,430
I ended up setting up too much red tape, or at least trying to.

00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:01,180
I got a lot of push-back and I really appreciated it, in the Node.js committee.

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,009
There's two committees in Node.

00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:11,419
The technical steering committee, the inward stuff and the org and the community committee

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:16,939
focuses on outreach community stuff.

00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:20,620
When I was beginning to get involved there, I was like, oh, yeah, we need to mimic all

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:29,050
the things that the TS C and.

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,800
-- I got a lot of push-back on that and rightfully so, because it was going to be limiting the

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,919
growth of how we can actually engage with the community, and it was very unnecessary

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,290
at the time, because we didn't actually know if we needed that.

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,139
Those things existed in the technical steering committee and working groups for a very good

00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:49,360
reason.

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,480
Whereas the com com was new, the community committee was new and didn't necessarily need

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,399
that.

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:05,250
We decided to go down different paths and I'm very glad we did this.

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:17,560
Instead of doing working groups and teams we went down a path of pure initiatives.

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,690
In the com com we've gone a completely different path and if those things that I've actually

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,410
PRed landed, we would not be on that path today.

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,410
So lesson 2: Empowerment.

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,180
Empower your contributors.

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,150
So without contributors being empowered, there's not a reason for them to stick around.

00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,970
This is a vital, vital thing to make people feel welcome and like they're making an impact,

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,149
because they are.

00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,630
You need to actually give them that to make them kind of want to be there and to feel

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,290
like they own something or that they belong.

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:57,700
And this is a phrase I like: So enabling contributors enables contributors to enable contributors,

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:04,070
so by you doing something to help lift someone else up, that someone that you helped lift

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,950
up actually helps them go lift other people up.

00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,610
So it becomes a network effect of you being able to grow your community just by being

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,720
present and welcoming and giving trust to people.

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,300
And that's something I really believe in and I've personally seen this happen and be very

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,000
successful many times.

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,430
So in Node, we had the evangelism working group.

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,690
This was in both Node.js and io.js.

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,950
I was involved in both sides of it.

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,470
I didn't mean to both sides there.

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,470
But you get the point.

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,870
It was a working group that was both in io and Node.

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,910
We had a pretty tremendous scope.

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,260
How do you define that?

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,180
What is that scope?

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,180
That social media?

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Is that blogging?

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,850
Is that providing resources for events?

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,100
How do you actually get that?

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,760
And because that scope was so big, we didn't actually necessarily have the resources that

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,070
we needed to, and so we ended up a little bit like Oliver Twist here, asking for more

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,810
and not necessarily getting it.

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:23,389
more because it was too broad and we weren't actually giving them a usable request.

00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:27,720
And that was a case of a group not necessarily being empowered and not because of anyone

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,829
else not empowering them, but because we were not defining our scope well enough to be empowered.

00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:41,600
And so in that, we eventually kind of split out into the community committee.

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,779
It's a very long arc that we could go into later if anyone is interested, but basically

00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:51,399
they're a new committee that kind of did similar work was eventually instantiated at the top

00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:58,051
level of the Node foundation and we kind of got to this place where we were able to have

00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:05,440
power and define what we were doing a lot better and actually find success with certain

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,070
pron projects and kill off other projects when they weren't needed.

00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:15,509
And it was really good way for us to be able to flex that muscle of empowerment and get

00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:18,280
more people involved actively.

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,120
Cool.

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,199
So lesson 3: Accept help along the way.

00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:31,130
The first time I gave this talk, it was to student ambassadors or campus experts for

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,050
GitHub education.

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:40,550
I at the time was chairperson of the community committee and was feeling super burnt out.

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,730
I -- it was toward the end of my time there and I had just spent a lot of time on it,

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:53,209
and it was just basically direct correlation to how much time I spent on it, and me not

00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,790
kind of setting boundaries for myself.

00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,509
And also going and trying to do everything by myself.

00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:05,480
So one of the lessons that I think is really, really important is you can't actually own

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,269
a community.

00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,850
Because at that point it ceases becoming a community.

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,380
It's a project that you are the owner of.

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:23,440
And this kind of came -- I learned about this in Tent.

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:33,180
Turns out software is never going to be perfect

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,440
and to think that is a little bit maybe not correct.

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,860
So three people were working on this.

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,171
They were doing a really good job and they had a really good base, but because they were

00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:48,579
focusing on it being perfect for 1.0, they actually ended up ignoring the massive community

00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:55,459
that they built and instead, just focusing on their thing and by not actually letting

00:13:55,459 --> 00:14:01,720
people contribute in a way that was meaningful, they killed their community.

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,470
They killed every kind of ounce of goodwill and every project actually that was built

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,139
on top of their platform.

00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,480
They killed it.

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,819
Because they were trying to own it, rather than trying to actually make a community.

00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:25,899
So it became a little bit like the ring where they were really trying to go for the perfect

00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,300
thing, and they owned it, it was theirs.

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,500
And nobody else could kind of help.

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,259
Because they were the only ones with the vision and the insight to do it.

00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:40,060
And for what it's worth, they're all wonderful people, and I think it was a really good project,

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,930
but that's kind of what ended up happening.

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,690
This is also true: Communities can outgrow the project leadership.

00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,839
This is definitely the case in Node.

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:59,090
For a long time there was a BDFL model benevolent dictator for life so it's basicalliy you're

00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:04,540
someone who ons or runs the project and accepts other help.

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:11,510
It, too, was going to be perfect with 1.0, which is why we're on 0.10 and 0.12 was in

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:17,089
development for so long, and throughout the process, I believe there were three total

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:27,430
BDFLs, yeah, so those BDFLs did good work for the project, but the project outgrew them.

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,160
As was shown by io.js.

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,949
There was a ton of people that were going to be working on Node, but they were the gatekeepers

00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:40,819
in a way that prevented that.

00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:47,180
So Node has changed from that model through the io.js fork to a more community-centric

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,390
model.

00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:55,970
This focuses on enabling community members or anyone, really, to come and participate

00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:02,279
and engage and build the platform.

00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:12,230
I started by a very small contribution that actually got closed, because I didn't know

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,250
how markdown worked.

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:20,810
So I was trying to fix links that were broken, but I was hard-linking GitHub instead of doing

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:29,140
the GitHub URLs, instead of doing correct kind of well formed link.

00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,560
So and now, you know, I'm involved in the project, because I've been able to dedicate

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,120
more and more time, and that has actually helped my career in a lot of ways and I've

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,440
been able to spend more time actually working on Node itself, or at least the community

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,550
around it.

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:52,649
So by enabling people to grow up in your project, you actually create -- you can create leaders

00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:53,940
for the future.

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,190
You can create a hiring pipeline if that's important to you in your company, if it's

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,139
like a corporate open source project and you can generally build a lot of goodwill and

00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:06,990
care and compassion for your community, which is really important if you really want to

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,870
actually have an open source community.

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:16,839
You have to let people flock together and really understand how this is a cohesive group,

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,539
rather than, you know, something that I'm running personally.

00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:26,520
So lesson 4: Communicate effectively.

00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,980
This is a very interesting one.

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,740
In my experience, nobody prefers to communicate the same way as someone else.

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,980
And I don't mean necessarily how they write, although that is definitely a factor.

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,799
I actually mean the media that they're choosing or the medium that they're choosing to actually

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,090
communicate through.

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,730
Communicating an idea, one-on-one, and kind of building consensus beforehand is a really

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,570
effective thing and doing that on the platform of choice of someone you're trying to communicate

00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:02,570
with is really, really powerful and impactful and it's a good way to actually build goodwill

00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,669
with both that person and the community because you're not presenting something that's highly

00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:12,700
contentious without kind of understanding everyone at the table and how they can kind

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,500
of engage with it and where they're standing and maybe understanding their objections,

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,130
as well.

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:25,640
So this has kind of been an evolving thing for me.

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,020
But you know in that evolution, I've really learned that there are so many platforms that

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,070
we all prefer to be on.

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:41,350
You know, for political reasons or privacy reasons, or, you know, just access reasons.

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,909
There's a lot of different things that you have to cater for if you're building an open

00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:45,909
source community.

00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:51,110
You have to be willing and open to accepting communication on different media, just because

00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,440
it's so -- the internet landscape for communication is so broad.

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,320
So whether that's IRC or Twitter DMs or email or whatever, please be open to that because

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,700
that's a really good way to open the barrier to contributing.

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:13,200
That said if you're not having a centralized communication media, you need to also assert

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,690
that that's an OK thing, because just assuming that everyone knows that or that they'll be

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:23,370
willing to communicate to you what their communication preferences are is a challenge.

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,320
So asserting that, you know, you can reach out to us on Twitter, or you can send us an

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,820
email or, you know, if you're in any of these Slack groups you're also welcome to do that,

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,309
or if you're in Discord or IRC or whatever.

00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:42,909
Making sure that you're open to that but also being open to having more social media is

00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:58,710
really impactful to accessibility in terms of personal and global access.

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:15,580
In io.js, it became very transparent of how do we do these things, but I was still really

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,750
nervous and not really comfortable.

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,900
I ended up back-channeling a lot of people, Michael Rogers specifically I back-channelled

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:29,440
quite a bit, just because I didn't know what I was doing, I also commented on GitHub a

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
lot.

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
I engaged in there.

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,490
GitHub is also a valid communication media.

00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,070
And I also reached out to people on Slack.

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:45,020
And I basically tried to go through all of the channels and make sure that I was connecting

00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:50,200
with people and that helped me succeed, but I also realize the inverse is true, where

00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,980
if you go to other people, you can help lift them up and help them succeed more.

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,610
So by doing that, you're actually building trust and awareness that it's OK to reach

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:08,190
out to me on this platform, or it's OK for me to not exist on this required platform

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,720
that is basically mandated by this project.

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,280
So certain channels, you know, given that, will eventually emerging as the thing your

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,360
team or your group or your community needs and uses once you hit a certain scale.

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,539
In Node, there isn't actually a suggested way of how we can like realtime talk to each

00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:33,659
other.

00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:40,050
There's been many long and contentious proposals about IRC versus Slack versus Discord or some

00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,330
other platform.

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:47,140
And we've kind of decided that we're not going to have a centralized platform outside of

00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,730
GitHub because there are too many people who care too passionately about it.

00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:58,570
And it's like you would be surprised at how contentious setting up a Slack is.

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,580
It's real hard.

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:07,120
So, you know, I think there's a lot of benefit in that, though, in that we as individuals

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:15,590
can go and talk to each other outside of that.

00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:21,020
There's also the Node.js Slack, like the unofficial community Node.js Slack that we have brought

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,730
in as a community project and we really appreciate and I talk to a lot of people on there.

00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,600
There's a lot of media that we can actually go and use, and this actually ends up being

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,771
beneficial because it creates multiple routes for people to come and participate where they

00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,320
might not have found this other route because it's not the normal kind of space that they

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,720
would live in.

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,590
So basically you kind of need to have every communication platform available.

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,730
And be able to communicate through there and that doesn't mean you as an individual, but

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:59,570
it's very, very helpful to have access, or be accessible, rather, to everyone, via as

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,580
many platforms as possible.

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:07,350
And this becomes especially true geographically where certain sites or tools are blocked and

00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:12,240
others may not be, or others are preferred, whereas these ones are unknown and nobody

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,240
is on them in XYZ geographic region.

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,260
So try to go where people are comfortable.

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,260
Quick recap.

00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,740
I'm going to let you out a bit early.

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,419
So the lessons.

00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:28,240
Don't build too much.

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,470
Please don't build empty communities.

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,330
Build something that's minimal and then let the community grow naturally.

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,669
Empower your contributors.

00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,100
Contributors who feel empowered are actually more likely to stay around and contribute

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:49,000
and grow in your project and help your project grow, rather than kind of floating away once

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,750
they make a first PR and get a badge on their repo or on their profile.

00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,750
Accept help as a leader.

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:02,950
This is a really hard one to accept, and to exercise, and if you want help, I'm more than

00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,910
happy to help.

00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:09,659
But if you don't let others do work, you're not going to have a good time as a leader

00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:14,560
and you're eventually going to burn out and not be able to continue.

00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,510
And then communicate with people in different ways.

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,279
Please allow people to communicate with you how you're comfortable, but also how they're

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:27,580
comfortable and try as a community organizer to cater to your community's needs, which

00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:34,360
again, taking into account lesson 1: May be different from what you initially expect.

00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,100
So, how you can actually apply these lessons today.

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
Have a scope.

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,960
Have something that you can really stick to.

00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,940
This helps ensure that you're not creating empty space and it helps kind of nurture your

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,280
natural growth.

00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,350
Have a path to meaningful contribution, so don't just always suggest, oh, yeah, the good

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,730
first contribution is adding a test.

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,559
Yes, tests help increase coverage and they help you kind of as a project become more

00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,950
stable, but that also, like, at the end of the day, doesn't really feel meaningful as

00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:15,080
a contributor who's coming to your community for the first time.

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,059
Having something where they can go and help ship a feature and go and help improve a feature

00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,730
or go and help do something that actually is impactful and that users of your project

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:29,200
or your community will end up seeing, is a really good way to do that.

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,190
Ownership leads down an unhealthy and unhappy path.

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:40,679
Owning a community on top of like the toxicity for your own community, is also really unhealthy

00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,960
for you and it's something you should avoid at all costs.

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,320
I highly recommend this.

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,029
Onboarding new leaders and onboarding people who care about the project is really important

00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:56,200
for your success and your own personal health.

00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,860
And then communicate effectively.

00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,450
Have multiple channels.

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:05,540
Know that people use them differently and that's okay, and accept that.

00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,540
But yourself, you should try to use them as effectively as possible to communicate with

00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
your community.

00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,159
