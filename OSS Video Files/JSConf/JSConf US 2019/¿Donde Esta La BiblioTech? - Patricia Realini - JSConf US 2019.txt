Title: ¿Donde Esta La BiblioTech? - Patricia Realini - JSConf US 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-12
Playlist: JSConf US 2019
Description: 
	When it comes to accessibility, in the Javascript community we often forget to talk about what it takes to get on the internet in the first place, yet the Federal Communications Commission estimates that 34 million Americans don’t have access to the internet. Where do these people go when they need to check their email, turn in their homework, or apply for a job? To the original open archive for information: public libraries! In this talk we will peer into the digital divide and learn about what public libraries across the United States are doing to support their communities access to the world wide web. We will discuss how hardware constraints, PC reservation software, browser access, and broadband speeds affect user experience and what we can do to help librarians and the Digital Inclusion movement.

Donde Esta La BiblioTech?

00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,160
Patricia Realini KATIE: Hello. Welcome back. So, this is the

00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,160
last talk before we all get to take a break and get a snack. Try to, like, resist the

00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,160
urge to just go off to the pool and not come back because if you do it then I'll do it.

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,160
And then who is gonna introduce the speakers if I'm not here? No. So, our next speaker

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,315
is Patricia Ruiz  oh, gosh. My brain. I'm sorry. I just. Patricia Ruiz Realini. I got

00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:08,890
that right, right? Yes. Okay. Cool. And Patricia, when I asked her about her fun fact in had

00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,890
her first job for three years, she was a taekwondo instructor. And if you have a problem with

00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,890
the bathroom policy, talk to her, not Brian. She'll set you straight. No, I'm sorry. She's

00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,470
a lovely person and you're going to enjoy her talk. Everyone, give it up for Patricia.

00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,470
[ Applause ] PATRICIA: Hi, everybody. I'm so excited to

00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,470
be here. Thank you so much for coming to see my talk. I hope you're having a great first

00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,760
day. I would like to begin by acknowledging that we're on occupied lands and offer respect

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,920
towards the people past and present. And I would also like to thank the organizers for

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,330
another year of JSConf US. It's already starting to be  it's already  it's off to a really

00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,939
great start and I'm so grateful to be here. I have been wanting to give this talk for

00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:38,000
a very long time. I used to live on the same block as the public library in my neighborhood

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,940
and I would go constantly to pick up books that I placed on hold. To co work in the summers

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,199
because I didn't have AC and to print out concert tickets because I didn't to want spend

00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:57,390
my money on a printer and printer ink. And I got the experience of using the Internet

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,800
from the library and it made me curious about what it is like to depend on libraries around

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,750
the country for Internet access. Since then, I have made efforts to stop into public libraries

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:15,440
it compare the experiences. That was the impetus for this talk. If you walk past the computer

00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,330
bay in a library, it becomes evident that when you don't own a device, personal computer

00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:30,260
or have a personal broadband connection goes far beyond the physical limitations. 30% of

00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,860
the rural US is closer to dial up speeds than broadband speeds. And urban broadband users

00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:44,320
are on 3.1 megabytes per second. You recall users are lucky to achieve 500 kilobytes a

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:53,700
second. 162.8 million people do not use the Internet at broadband speeds. While the FCC

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,460
previously reported that broadband is not available to 24.7 million Americans, that

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:07,240
is stark in rural areas. For example, Microsoft found in Ferry County, Washington, they estimated

00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,280
only 2% of people use broadband service versus the 100% that the federal government is said

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,700
so far access in that area. While many might focus on just the rural access, city broadband

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,420
access is also just as relevant. The University of Illinois of Chicago's digital excellence

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,260
in Chicago report found that 40% of Chicago residents, especially Latinx population, have

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:37,200
limited or in access to the Internet. Of that 40%, 35% have to use Wi Fi in public places

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,810
to get access. 25% of all Chicagoans do not use the Internet. Of those, people do not

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,730
use the Internet at all, while 15% only have limited access. And here on the map, we can

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,040
see those discrepancies based on geography and how that specifically happens in low income

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,740
areas. On the left you can see the percentage who have Internet access at home, and on the

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,760
right you can see the percentage who do not have Internet access at home because of difficulty

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,290
of availability. This has a real effect on people's livelihoods. The US bureau of labor

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,910
statistics employment data shows that the highest unemployment rates are frequently

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:23,510
located in the counties with the lowest availability of broadband. This is why the 16,700 public

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,960
library locations nationwide are so vital to the Internet. And on their own, are an

00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,600
incredible source of information about our users. The Institute of museums and library

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:41,070
services 2019 report on the 2016 fiscal year found that for every 5,000 people libraries 

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:48,850
for every 5,000 people libraries serving a small population size offer 23.68 computers

00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:56,790
versus  while only 4.04 library computers are available in libraries that serve large

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:04,650
populations. For example, 70% of Idaho's 103 libraries are the only source of free Internet

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,250
in Idaho's rural and remote communities. After significant investment from the broadband

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,550
technology opportunities program, the mean connection speed in Idaho libraries is still

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:22,820
only 12.8 megabytes per second. A steep drop from the national average of 57.4. The report

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:32,660
looked at the discrepancies in availability. And it does vary across states. Seven states

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,910
including Hawaii had fewer than four computers per 5,000 people. While two states, including

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:46,820
Vermont and Nebraska had more than nine. Most states had between 10 and 20 public access

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:54,520
Internet computers per a stationary outlet. DC having the most at 38.46. Libraries are

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,440
highly popular amongst adolescent and teenagers who want to spend time with other people their

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,441
age because they're open, accessible, free, and librarians make them feel welcome. In

00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:08,930
many branches, they even assign areas for teenagers to be with one another. Compared

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,020
to the social space of the library with the social spaces of commercial establishments

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,490
like Starbucks or McDonald's, not everyone can afford to frequent them, and not all paying

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,550
customers are welcome to stay for long. Black and brown people, poor and homeless people

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:29,900
don't consider entering these spaces. They know standing outside a high end eatery can

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:37,360
make managers call the police. And I have been in restaurant using Wi Fi and ask police

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:45,150
ask a person who was coming from jail and was a homeless person, I watched them ask

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,140
this person to leave and say they were not welcome at the establishment because they

00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,980
did not fit in. This is really limiting so much access for people that desperately need

00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:03,080
it. So, where do they go? They go to the BiblioTech, of course. And not just during opening hours.

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:10,990
The 2016 usage and engagement report found that 7% of Americans age 60 and overuse the

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:17,210
library Wi Fi signal outside when libraries are closed. A lot of the main reasons for

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,580
Internet usage in public library are similar to a lot of our own basic Internet needs.

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,580
Checking email, doing research in many cases on personal health and outside of these uses,

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,400
the most different are taking classes and getting certifications. For example, getting

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,180
a food handling license to work in a restaurant is a process that takes about three hours

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,950
online and is one of the most common certifications out there for people in low income positions.

00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:51,520
Historically, this disproportionately affects black, Latinx, homeless and immigrants the

00:06:51,520 --> 00:07:00,050
most. With 58% of new American arrivals using the library Internet on a rate of once a week.

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,580
Kids under the age of 16 and also highly effective. Seven of ten teachers now require homework

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:15,230
with Internet access. Yet a third of kindergartners and others are unable to go online from home.

00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:23,380
Some in Coachella and Huntsville, Alabama, require buses that have Wi Fi. They are sometimes

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:31,600
parked overnight and can connect and continue studying. In Detroit and New Orleans, as many

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,711
as one third of homes do not have broadband, children crowd libraries and other areas to

00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:43,930
use free hot spots. Broadband limitations don't just change when and where you use the

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,120
Internet, but how. Google's 2011 state of interactivity report shows the difference

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,320
in usage based on broadband speeds. Here we can see people with limited access tend to

00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,600
download and rely on offline more than the cloud because they have higher access to broadband

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:09,811
speeds. Specific to the library experience, there are a few standout considerations. Time

00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:15,380
outs are frequently out of the control of librarians on PC reservation software and

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,199
it is a huge barrier for systemically oppressed people. Because when your identity contingencies

00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,230
generate social pressure, and the result of this being stereo type threat, it means people

00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:30,460
are less likely to speak up and ask for help when they need a longer session on the computer.

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,029
And in most cases, there are many library locations where the librarians are not familiar

00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:41,879
with how to make the changes or have the administrative access to do so. When I visited the San Francisco

00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:50,899
public library, with a 25 guest pass I had 15 minutes. With 5 minutes to start up the

00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:56,680
reservation system. And the last 5 minutes, bombarded that it will end soon. Imagine trying

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:03,300
to take a three hour certification course that cannot be returned to under those conditions.

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:11,019
The Chicago public library requires people to show through ID that they are not Chicagoans

00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:20,509
to access guest pass. Some charge due to low budgets and limited numbers of biases. And

00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:27,579
you can see the biased co worker below, people like this are highly likely to accelerate

00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:33,029
charges on overdue materials and limit and bar people from Internet action access and

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:39,670
the library. On the technical side, Windows 10 is the most prevalent operating system.

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:46,110
While just in 2018, just last year, many librarians reported they're still in the process of moving

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,160
from Windows 8 to Windows 10. Sorry. That's a little  I can't see the rest of my speaker

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,010
notes. I'm trying  so, there's also a lot of device and Wi Fi hot spot lending that

00:09:54,010 --> 00:10:00,220
libraries do, but most of the time this is at a fee. They usually charge about $5 to

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,559
check out a Wi Fi hot spot and take it home. And in some cases, if they're lucky, they

00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:10,569
have access to remote device management software that allows them to turn these devices off

00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:16,019
if they're overdue. But the charges can be up to $150 for not returning a Wi Fi hot spot

00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:24,739
to the library. With these charges, with device remote management software that librarians

00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:29,709
use to throttle data so they don't have to pay high charges, we see that a lot of libraries

00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:34,810
have difficulty offering these services without grants and subsidies that are highly needed

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:42,230
in their communities. Being barred usage of the Internet in libraries is much more common

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:49,100
than you think. In Seattle, patrons who $20 are blocked from borrowing, and $25, they

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,910
are sent to collection agencies. Even in prosperous Seattle, 20% of accounts are blocked due to

00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:03,189
debt. This should be changing soon as Seattle just had a vote in August 6th of this year

00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:09,420
where they passed prop 1 which is going to eliminate the fine system at the Seattle public

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,959
library which is fantastic news. But  and we see that this is also happening in DC,

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,259
Salt Lake and Baltimore. The San Francisco public library has 5% of accounts blocked

00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:26,660
due to overdue fines, but in low income areas, the rate is as high as 11% and they are currently

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,860
also going through a proposal to go fine free as well. And this is important to know because

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,760
fines aren't even a significant revenue for any libraries. Salt Lake went fine free in

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,269
2017 after finding that late fees accounted for just .3% of the city library's total revenue.

00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:49,610
Research shows overdue fines do not ensure materials end up back on the shelves. And

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,869
fine free have not seen an increase in late returns. One library saw the late return rate

00:11:54,869 --> 00:12:02,529
drop from 9% to 4% following fine elimination. Some of the most pressing needs when it comes

00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:09,970
to Internet access in libraries are PC reservation compatible access, accessibility shortcuts.

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:16,069
Most notably access to changing signs of text on the screens. Because some PC reservation

00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:23,179
software obfuscate access to any kind of visual controls. Also, the text to speech access

00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:35,060
and just most of the accessibility shortcuts on our computers is obfuscated by the software.

00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:42,470
And they're often limited to select locations, making access even harder. And with low broadband

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,760
speeds, performance is also a super paramount issues as well as authentication and anti

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,100
surveillance measures that we'll get a little bit deeper into. the Google need for speed

00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:01,689
report found that 53% of website visitors leave with f a website doesn't load in 3 seconds.

00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:09,079
The average load is 9 seconds on a 3G connection. That's as long as it takes to sing the alphabet

00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:15,529
song. And 14 seconds on a 4G connection. When surveyed, they found one out of two expect

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:26,730
it to load in less than 2 seconds. And faster sites had session lengths 70% longer and bounce

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:33,309
rates that were 35% lore. 61% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site that they

00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:40,029
had trouble accessing and 40% will visit a competitor's website instead. Mobile sites

00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:47,059
that loaded in 5 seconds earned almost double the revenue websites that took 19 seconds.

00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:56,319
And you can boost conversion by 27%. Part of the problem is ads on mobile. Mobile ads

00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:02,699
take an average of 5 seconds to load. About double the time as it takes for desktop ads

00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:06,809
to load according to the media ratings council. Sorry.

00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:12,209
Email and online  and then another issue past performance is authentication. Recently

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,579
there was this Twitter thread a few months ago which made me sad that it happened after

00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:21,329
my talk and not before. Because I was excited to tell you about this. But email and online

00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:28,309
messages SMS services like WhatsApp are truly the modern catch 22. You need an email to

00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:33,859
get a phone number. And you need a phone number to get an email. So, especially for people

00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:42,359
struggling with homelessness, this is a huge barrier for them to escape this oppression.

00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:46,370
And I personally think that this problem is ripe for password managers to find a solution

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:53,009
to. I would love to see authentication stations in libraries utilizing authenticator app technology

00:14:53,009 --> 00:15:03,410
and having access base on a librarian's approval. For users that are not web literate, dealing

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:10,559
with sensitive materials like paying bills and sharing photos. An example of handling

00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,529
this is making sure that we detect in f a device is a new device and it's the first

00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:22,399
time logging on. We can offer alerts and messaging like GDRP and communicating with them and

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:34,569
what to do before working on computers that may be insecure. Another security factor is

00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:39,899
surveillance. Facial recognition software is creeping into libraries starting in academic

00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:46,839
libraries today. The most prevalent threat, however, to intellectual freedom is section

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:54,931
215 of the patriot act. The government can demand the library records with a secret can

00:15:54,931 --> 00:16:02,579
court order and without probable cause. They can block the librarians from revealing the

00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:10,720
request, and it doesn't only cover the books, but Internet check ins, and hard drives from

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:20,089
library computers. Libraries took action to protect patrons. Posting these within view

00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:25,939
of computer stations. In fall of 2002, the library research center at the University

00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:33,379
of Illinois surveyed 1500 libraries and found that of the 444 libraries that had been subject

00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:39,779
to law enforcement requests for information about patrons, 225 had not cooperated but

00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:46,089
219 had. Librarians in Santa Cruz demonstrated their opposition by taking drastic measures

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:53,829
and shredding all historical information including computer usage or a daily basis. In 2005,

00:16:53,829 --> 00:17:00,389
four Connecticut librarians going under the modicum of John Doe with the help of the ACLU

00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:05,940
sued the US attorney general to lift the gag order that the librarians were subject to

00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:14,200
produce records. By 2006, the FBI dropped the defense of the gag division. It was expired

00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:21,520
in May of 2015, but the US freedom act, the expired parts of the law with the exception

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:29,160
of the gag order were reported broadly as restored and renewed and come up for expiration

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:36,380
this year in December. But there's a lot of success stories too. Libraries are still the

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,820
most helpful resource for learning about the Internet and web literacy classes are the

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,640
most highly requested programming at libraries. Because library staff need to be totally up

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,890
to date on their digital skills, they learn these things just in time and turn around

00:17:50,890 --> 00:18:00,010
and immediately start teaching them to patrons. My favorite resource are the zines by read

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:06,681
me and they host crypto parties. And there are libraries offering some of the most high

00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:14,110
tech access rout there. The Los Angeles library has the Octavia Butler space. It's at the

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:21,320
location that's great for families to toy around with 3D printing and all kinds of other

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:31,420
high tech gadgets. And the Austin public library, the laptop stations with computer users and

00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:37,070
up to date technology. All you have to do is scan your library card and unlock one of

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:43,260
these laptops much like you would unlock a bicycle out in a rideshare program and you

00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:51,730
can use the laptop anywhere you want in the library. The biggest tax credits, grants and

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,760
subsidies only go so far to support public library Internet access. All the most robust

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:04,540
results are the public private partnerships. We as a community should be doing everything

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:10,270
we can to encourage the companies we work for to get involved and help build partnerships

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:15,860
to get better hardware, software and help. Overreliance on the federal broadband stimulus

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,130
program has tied censorship to funding and the future has the potential to be bleak as

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:28,730
we have seen how the patriot act affected usage of the Internet in the libraries. And

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:38,170
there was the initiative that has harnessed the unused channels known as white space.

00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:49,380
It's unused spectrum below 700 megahertz. Using UHF signals. This is sometimes called

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:56,200
super Wi Fi. It behaves like regular Wi Fi but uses lower channels to cover greater distances

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:06,740
than Wi Fi hot spots. It's less populated in remote regions. And imagine the capacity

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,630
for urban areas where people don't have personal access at home. Where their kids need to stay

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,750
on buses to be able to use Wi Fi to finish their homework. If your company can't get

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:27,530
involved, volunteer for a crypto at your library. Organize your next meetup at a library

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:36,670
computer lab to give more access to people outside of your own personal circle. So,

00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,700
thank you so much for coming and hearing about what it's like to use the Internet at the

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,920
library. I hope next time you stop by a library and check out what it's like to use their

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,933
computers and not just your fancy Macbooks. Thank you.

00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:48,933
[ Applause ] KATIE: All right. Thank you so much, Patricia.

00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:49,933
And how freakin' awesome is the themed slide presentation. Yes. So cool. It matches my

00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:50,933
new scrunchie. All right. So, it is time for a snack break. So, we will be back here in

00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:51,933
this room or the other room  what time again? At 4:15. So, we have quite a bit of time to

00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:51,949
