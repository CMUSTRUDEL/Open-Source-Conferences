Description: 
	Let's have some fun with TensorFlow and React. Not familiar with TensorFlow? No problem, you will get a fast crash course and learn how to track faces and add silly adornments (I bet you would look good with a new set of reading frames) entirely in the browser with TensorFlow and React. With a good background in the tech let's expand to tracking multiple limbs and evaluating and scoring some yoga positions. We will look at a couple different scoring algorithms, and finally challenge the audience to beat our high score for ultimate bragging rights.
