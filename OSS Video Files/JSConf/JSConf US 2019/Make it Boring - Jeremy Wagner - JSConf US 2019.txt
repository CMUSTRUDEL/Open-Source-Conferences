Title: Make it Boring - Jeremy Wagner - JSConf US 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-10
Playlist: JSConf US 2019
Description: 
	A good case can be made for why boring is preferable to exciting in many aspects of our lives. Yet, we're reluctant to apply this sentiment to the web. Rather, we're in a relentless pursuit of the exciting in this increasingly JavaScript-centric world of web development. A pursuit that, despite our best efforts, litters the landscape of the web with excruciatingly slow and inaccessible pages. As division brews over the roles of HTML, CSS, and indeed JavaScript itself, we need to ask if it's worth making the web boring again.

But why make the web more boring? Because boring is fast, resilient, fault tolerant, and accessible. Boring is the essence of unobtrusive designs that facilitate interactions rather than hinder them. When we rely wholesale on JavaScript to build for the web, we're inevitably reinventing thingsâ€”things that can hinder or even fail people in unexpected ways despite our best intentions. In this session, you'll learn why building for the web with a greater emphasis on core technologies is far from boring, but truly rewarding and exciting work that makes the web more inclusive.

I never heard so much enthusiasm for it

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:17,220
so here we go

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,830
so as Paris said in Thank You Paris

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,439
my name is Jeremy Wagner I am a web

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,769
performance consultant and a sort of

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,300
general web tinkerer and I'd love to

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,789
thank the organizers for such a great

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,840
opportunity and for you for your

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,239
willingness to come to a talk called

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,870
make it boring at a JavaScript

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,800
conference so okay turn on presenter

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,360
remote I'm an adult okay so this talk is

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
the live version of an opinion piece

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,500
that I wrote earlier this year by the

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,059
same name so if you've read that post

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,850
you probably already know what you're

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,140
getting into and before warned there's

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,940
not much actual code in this talk so

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,469
like the post it's based on it's kind of

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,090
this melange of thoughts and

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,940
philosophies and opinions so if you're

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,500
like as they close the doors if you are

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,740
like you know I really kind of just want

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,659
to like maybe see something Cody the HP

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,200
track has an awesome talk by Simeon on

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,330
on Chrome extensions but if you're here

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,400
cool I won't be offended but thank you

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,540
for chilling out any in any case I hope

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,810
you like it okay so I think we have a

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,950
little echo on this mic okay I

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,229
originally wanted to open this talk with

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,860
a boring story or anecdote but that

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,320
would be boring so instead I'll kick

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,259
things off and talk about an exciting

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,210
thing and how that exciting thing ended

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,400
up being so risky and destructive that

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,369
it wiped out trillions of dollars of

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,619
wealth most of you probably remember the

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:51,390
subprime mortgage crisis which played

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,860
out between 2007 and 2008 before I

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,630
continue I'd like to assure you that

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,340
this is a talk about web development not

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,259
finance the subprime mortgage crisis was

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,909
an entirely avoidable economic

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,270
catastrophe that began with the creation

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,550
of the mortgage-backed security exciting

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,200
right the mortgage-backed security is a

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,090
financial product backed by home

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,300
mortgages it was created long before the

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,950
crisis ever occurred

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,630
and a big chunk of home loans get

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,060
bundled up into this product which

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,790
investment banks then offer to investors

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,010
it's generally considered a very safe

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,290
investment most people don't default on

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,020
their loans this limits the risk

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:32,440
so while returns are relatively modest

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:35,320
they're dependable seems pretty boring

00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,370
so far right here's where it gets

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,320
exciting when Congress deregulated

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,530
Investment Banking in the 90s investment

00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,420
banks got all ginned up the lack of

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,460
proper regulations allowed banks to

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,380
offer high-risk subprime mortgage loans

00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,500
and sometimes even these disgusting

00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,840
interest-only loans and then on the

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,030
investment side came credit default

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,920
swaps where investors could bet against

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,590
the US housing market effectively

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,310
rooting for and ultimately profiting

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:09,400
from the downfall of the US economy and

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,080
that's exactly what happened as the Fed

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,120
raised interest rates in an attempt to

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,800
cool things down

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,720
adjustable rate subprime loans adjusted

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,130
accordingly which spurred defaults on a

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,160
massive scale and then markets tanked

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,920
taking the economy with them all because

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,720
investing wasn't risky or exciting

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,430
enough already this is a perfect example

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,600
to me of when boring would have been

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,930
preferable to exciting

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,700
if markets and banks had been properly

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,709
regulated and yielded boringly

00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,450
predictable returns things would be

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,010
different today people would have been

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,570
set who were set to retire would have

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,330
been able to at that time instead of

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,800
having to rebuild their portfolios some

00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,530
people would have been able to keep

00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,050
their homes and just as an aside and

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,690
it's a total aside this is why ethics

00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,700
and regulations are critical because

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,080
just because you can fleece someone for

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,470
everything they've got doesn't mean you

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,660
should if it sounds like I'm drawing a

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,030
parallel between the state of modern

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,550
development and this kind of crisis it's

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,709
because I am but I acknowledge that we

00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,989
are not hurtling toward a comparable

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,840
crisis with even remotely similar

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:22,570
consequences but we are headed towards

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,700
something and the trend doesn't look so

00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,800
great and part of the reason why this

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,879
trend persists at least I believe is

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,000
because we're not operating with

00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,800
sensible defaults and more and more web

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,720
development has become more like

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,550
software engineering in some respects I

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,849
believe this is a welcome in logical

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,460
progression but I do sometimes wonder in

00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:44,280
the dead of night if we're ready for all

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,780
the responsibilities that that entails

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,580
because rather than evaluating each

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,250
individual projects requirements and

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,289
adapting our choice of tools to them we

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,990
tend to dive into right into what makes

00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:57,550
development exciting and fun for us so

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,180
to that end what do we do when we start

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:04,930
a new project we npm install a preferred

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,819
framework and then we might install a

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,270
client-side router for that framework

00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:14,110
and then maybe even a state management

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:16,780
library for the framework of course and

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,909
before you know it a project has started

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,219
with an amount of overhead that's baked

00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:25,060
in until you decide to migrate away from

00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:26,710
it somehow your preference for what

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,139
makes development more exciting or

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,360
perhaps I should say more convenient or

00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,039
comfortable has forced you to make

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,889
trade-offs that could make your apps

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,909
lower less accessible and less usable

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,560
when it comes to software development

00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:43,949
there's a word that I think is really

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,180
important and that word is constraints

00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:48,490
think of your favorite video games from

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,590
your childhood most Super Nintendo games

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,419
of the time could fit on a 1 megabyte

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,240
cartridge sometimes even in a quarter of

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:57,190
that size this point has been done to

00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,930
death I know but it endures because it

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,860
demonstrates how much can be done with

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,690
so very little yet I don't think it

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,699
fully acknowledges that the constraints

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,449
game developers faced at the time we're

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:12,490
far more fixed than ours are now so when

00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:14,080
developers make console games they knew

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,969
every consumer had the same hardware

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,779
those were the constraints and they were

00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:22,930
very predictable our constraints however

00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,460
make our job uniquely difficult people

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,949
access the web on a variety of devices

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,680
with wide ranging capabilities such as

00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:32,500
this affordable but slow moto G for

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,509
Android phone and this is to say nothing

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,930
of the varying quality of the networks

00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:39,370
these devices access the web through

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,540
this is a reality which requires us to

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,880
make architectural choice

00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,680
is that our best for people because

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,360
while our tools are convenient and they

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,600
help us to be productive they do

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,160
sometimes confer an external cost on

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,910
users that we must acknowledge and

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,220
redress in some capacity this is

00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,810
relevant because for example here in the

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,400
US while many people live in large

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,500
cities which are typically well served

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,360
by fast broadband and mobile internet

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,970
connections there are gaps even

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,030
sometimes chasms in this coverage that

00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,040
we must be mindful of this 2016 article

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,810
by the MIT Technology Review revealed

00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,580
that 58% of the households in the

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,240
cleveland metro area with yearly income

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:21,550
under $20,000 had no broadband internet

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,860
access these are people who rely on

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,490
mobile internet connections often with

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,800
data caps and overages to access the web

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,830
internet access is not a luxury it's a

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,300
right and more striking as this passage

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,880
in which Pew Research found that

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,020
one-third of Americans don't have an

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,710
internet connection in their homes

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:44,380
faster than dial-up I sincerely doubt

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:47,050
this is significantly improved since the

00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,210
article was written the economic and

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,860
infrastructural challenges have not been

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,070
sufficiently addressed to broaden

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,650
broadband access in these areas and to

00:07:54,070 --> 00:08:00,420
me this is a compelling reason to make

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,710
things boring again I can empathize with

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:05,320
wanting to make web development exciting

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,360
it's a big reason why I started doing

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:12,040
this stuff in the first place and when I

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,600
started I wanted to do everything my

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,580
first experience with making webpages

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,490
was in a WYSIWYG editor in middle school

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,650
and once I hit the limits of what that

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,010
thing could do I had a novel thought

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:26,140
which was hey the hell happens when I

00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:29,740
opened this here index dot HTM in a

00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,660
notepad that thought clearly changed my

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,979
life for the better I think it's fair to

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,800
say that I wouldn't be standing here in

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:37,419
the stage if I hadn't done that everyone

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,010
in our industry has an origin story and

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,770
for many of us that story begins with

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,920
the making of the fanpage for whatever

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:47,470
thing we were obsessed with at the time

00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,390
and for me that obsession was fixed on

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,980
the just fixed on the popular

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,200
first-person shooters of the day like

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,690
doom and hexan and quake and the ops

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,790
itself was irrelevant but but it gave me

00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,830
an excuse to propel myself down a path

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,050
of relentless and sometimes reckless

00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,960
experimentation I wanted to do

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,580
everything everything I mean everything

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,110
I wanted to put every last bit of new

00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,510
knowledge I quite I acquired about

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,970
making webpages to work right away and

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:19,430
in the most glaringly obnoxious way

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:22,670
possible apparently yeah that's that's

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,770
mine don't go look for it and in my

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,400
fervor I was inspired to make countless

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:30,710
garish sites with horrid color schemes

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:34,040
crappy animated gifs guest books that no

00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:37,910
one ever signed what web rings that no

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:43,250
one ever joined and then there was flash

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:44,960
Oh flash three iterations of my personal

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,970
website were crappy to advanced

00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,820
knockoffs where cosmetics and flashy

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,820
animations won out over literally any

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,650
kind of sensibility and like anyone my

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,900
inspiration was just a conduit through

00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,490
which I developed my skillset but what I

00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,100
didn't develop for the longest time was

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,840
discipline I didn't understand basic

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,880
design principles accessibility

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,650
performance user experience or literally

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,290
anything that would help me to make

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:12,110
websites anyone would want to use and

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,610
that's not to say that my excitement for

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,070
the medium or our excitement for the

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,110
medium is ill motivated I was just

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,510
inexperienced but the work that we're

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:23,690
paid to do requires us to build boringly

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:25,580
useable things sometimes that work is

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,310
the equivalent of creating digital push

00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,690
brooms they're ordinary as hell but yes

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,510
there are also tools that help people

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,610
accomplish tasks online banking job

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,110
applications buying essentials for the

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,140
home you name it

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,700
when our excitement for building for the

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,130
web is coupled with our thirst for

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,530
pushing it to do more all the time we

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,690
can inadvertently build heavy unusable

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,030
things that can hinder rather than

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:53,450
enable people to complete the tasks our

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:55,550
work enables them to achieve and so to

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,320
that end many new developers these days

00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,030
aren't entering the industry with a

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,680
decade of learning and experimentation

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:03,550
under their belts or even a four-year

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,230
degree boot camps are a big thing

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,060
they're people who are both new to and

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,040
really excited about building

00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:13,010
stuff for the web and making a living

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,140
from that work and we need these people

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,580
among us they're going to be the next

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,710
generation of developers that brings

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:22,010
renewed fervor to this industry and I

00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,660
can't wait to see what they do but this

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,150
isn't an experience that I can speak to

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,220
as my path was so radically different I

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,990
didn't join a web developer boot camp

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,350
and make a living off of my skills

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:35,570
within a year I had ten years of

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,730
unfettered experimentation before I

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,910
could make anything that anyone would

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,830
want to use or consider usable it takes

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:46,400
time and continuing education to develop

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,020
these sensibilities and because

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,120
employers favor skill sets that

00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,460
prioritize the fastest way of building

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,440
applications that means they're going to

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,200
hire people who know today's frameworks

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,700
and so the fastest way to start getting

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,520
paid after you graduate from boot camp

00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,170
is to apply for jobs that match the

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,510
framework based skills they taught you

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,790
in boot camp

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:10,070
thus hiring in the industry has become

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,750
an Ouroboros where employers want

00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:14,810
applicants with framework specifics

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,580
centered skillsets and consequently

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,710
developers learn those frameworks to get

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,050
gigs because hiring managers want to

00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:24,530
tick off the boxes and get devs to ship

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,510
code fast and often and so in this

00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:28,040
seemingly infinite loop frameworks

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,680
become the scaffolding upon which we

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,900
build our careers this isn't the worst

00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,030
thing that can happen framework and

00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,550
library specific knowledge can propel

00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,320
you to learn their underpinnings I would

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,060
never would have went as deeply into

00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,250
JavaScript as I have if not for the

00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,280
awesomeness that was jQuery in the late

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,650
2000s but I believe that a sole reliance

00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,690
on these abstractions can eventually

00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:53,450
become a limiting factor in your

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,370
long-term growth and unless your

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,260
curriculum sufficiently covers the

00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,540
fundamentals or you've had to learn them

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,810
on your own you'll always be reliant on

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,950
the abstractions to do the work

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,770
front-end development has been this way

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,270
for about a decade more so read the

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,760
resume of any veteran front-end

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,890
developer and you'll quickly see that it

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,670
resembles like a geologic column of

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:19,520
different skills this industry has

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,860
always chased what's so hot right now

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,860
and we're set up from day one of our

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,120
careers to feed into that arguably the

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,360
worst part of this is that our

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,000
continuing education in HTML CSS and

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,690
platform API is gets relegated to some

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,399
day or worse after hours where you have

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,519
to sacrifice some amount of work-life

00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,589
balance just to keep up and by the way

00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,630
not everyone has the time to devote in

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,279
their off hours to do that work they

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,320
have families they have responsibilities

00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:50,870
in my opinion we shouldn't compel them

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,290
to but rather enable them to explore and

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,180
learn on the job and all of this is

00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,510
ostensibly done in the name of

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,370
productivity sometimes at our own peril

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:03,560
this constant churn as Rachel Andrew

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,110
suggests in this very brilliant post I

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,760
suggest you read has us bound to a cycle

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,500
of never-ending site rebuilds and

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,740
framework migrations that can seem

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,290
counterproductive in hindsight and so

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,180
without careful consideration for which

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,250
abstractions are truly beneficial for

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,740
the purpose you're trying to serve being

00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,420
lashed to this wheel becomes a brutal

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,440
affair where progress becomes difficult

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,810
to sustain over the long term

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,089
whether it was jQuery then or react now

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:37,670
these tools are designed to make us more

00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:40,459
productive and they do blood if we were

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,170
pressed to admit it this constant churn

00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:44,000
is at least in part due to our desire to

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,190
make our work more fun and exciting and

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,440
it's something I like to call laptop

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,120
sticker culture something will can't see

00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,699
it from here but something I'm clearly

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,550
guilty of where everything we do

00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:57,260
outwardly appears badass or glamorous

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:02,360
and if I didn't know any better I'd

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:06,250
swear some of us are on tour it's also

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:09,019
why even in the year of our Lord 2019

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,540
you still see job postings every so

00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:15,290
often with with these superlatives like

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:17,000
rock star guru or ninja like am I

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:21,649
supposed to pack some shuriken z' with

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,390
my laptop like but hey hey why shouldn't

00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:25,360
our work be more fun and exciting a lot

00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:27,050
of career fields are boring Drudge work

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,270
shouldn't be shouldn't it be more

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:33,590
exciting right we're all propelled by

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,660
our interests

00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,120
and for you that interest could be

00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,700
JavaScript and friends could be HTML

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,890
could be CSS or it could be the various

00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,110
abstractions of these technologies but

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,330
if you could for a second put aside your

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,580
interests and ask yourself what what's

00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,930
the purpose you're trying to serve when

00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,220
you build something for the web

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,220
what are you helping people to

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,170
accomplish the varying answers we give

00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,000
to that question should form a curve

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,150
around which we adjust our philosophy

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,560
for how we build for the web because if

00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,870
you're in charge of any remotely

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,060
critical resource on the web your desire

00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:11,540
for a rich developer experience simply

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,160
must take a backseat to the task people

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,450
depend on the web for more than just

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,580
buying the web is a portal for many

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:22,190
critical resources stuff like job

00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,410
applications public assistance crisis

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,890
intervention and other services we tend

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:31,690
not to think about until we need them

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:34,070
ours is a job done by people for people

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,440
plumbers might get excited about PEX

00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,030
piping but they also understand that

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,950
their job is to ensure that the water

00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,260
gets from the main to the faucet the

00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,030
same as before

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,339
PEX pipe confers a material improvement

00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:49,640
for both installers and end-users

00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:51,470
without hampering functionality can we

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,460
consistently say the same thing about

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:57,380
all the conveniences that we rely on

00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,330
data flows through pipes of sorts but

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,950
the environmental constraints imposed on

00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,350
us by the network and the devices people

00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,020
use demand our most careful

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:08,079
consideration factors like network

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,060
bandwidth and latency are quite evident

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,620
but others such as server protocol or

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,290
device capabilities are a little more

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,900
subtle and then there's the person

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,329
holding the phone or tablet or sitting

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,370
behind a laptop each of which is an

00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:23,929
individual case study of capabilities

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:27,530
and limitations that demand our

00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:29,420
attention and so knowing this I think

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,220
it's important we avoid one assumption

00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,920
like the plague which is that our

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,310
conveniences always confer equal

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,590
benefits for users your enthusiasm for

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,090
virtual Dom frameworks probably doesn't

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,400
benefit someone who's been thrown out of

00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,640
their home by an abusive partner when

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,630
they turn to the web to find shelter

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,820
someone trying to find public

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,310
assistance information or apply for a

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:56,480
job on spotty Wi-Fi isn't helped by your

00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:58,220
client-side router somewhat arts are

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,310
conveniences have a time in a place and

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,700
that time is not always every time nor

00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:07,100
is that place always everywhere and I'm

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:11,030
not shaming anyone here for their choice

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:13,490
of tools I use I use tools I love them

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,320
but to stress that simply using them

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,710
won't do the difficult work of design

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:22,040
and user experience for you and so as

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,630
developers our ethical Duty isn't

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,000
limited to identifying and removing

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,770
excesses in code we also need to

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,690
challenge excesses which may look nice

00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:32,660
and design comps but only serve to

00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,700
frustrate people in practice excesses in

00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,520
design and development are necessarily

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,180
intertwined every interaction you can

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,820
simplify every boondoggle you can remove

00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:50,000
represents a benefit for the end-user so

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:51,230
let's make it boring the web is

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,950
frustrating when it creates obstacles

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:56,900
for people an obtrusiveness in websites

00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,900
are the result of every project manager

00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,370
designer and developer unwilling or most

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,590
of the time unable to question

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,300
ill-conceived business requirements

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,610
design decisions or architectural

00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,820
decisions or architectural choices it's

00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:12,380
on all of us and josh clark wrote an

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,240
article about design systems a while

00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,940
back and what struck me was his emphasis

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,000
on the role of boring in UX I'd be lying

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,320
if if I said I wasn't inspired by you

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,540
know this talk wasn't inspired by this a

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,980
little bit he discussed how when he

00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,200
helped his clients to create design

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,560
systems he stressed the importance of

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,260
simplicity and I quote the more common

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,290
the problem the better design systems

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,970
should prioritize the mundane and in a

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,580
world where everyone feels like they

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,440
just want to disrupt without it

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,690
considering the consequences this is

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,540
sage advice and for me it's a kind of

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,490
revitalizing tonic avoiding

00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,700
obtrusiveness in design is the very soul

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,080
of designs that work best for people

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,600
without acknowledging that we can only

00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:01,159
create fast accessible and usable

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,809
websites entirely by accident a perfect

00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,309
ample of obtrusive design was a

00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:06,229
little-known visualization project

00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:09,200
developed by Apple's research division

00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:12,549
called hot sauce which was an attempt at

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,289
visualizing site maps for websites

00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:17,299
instead of presenting this data in a

00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:20,570
very straightforward way it was

00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:22,639
presented as a 3d spatial field to its

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,159
credit hot sauce was a novel

00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:27,799
presentation of this data it was neat it

00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,419
was a fun experiment but no one wanted

00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,190
to browse a spatial rendering of a

00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:35,149
website's hierarchy as if they were on

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:37,429
the holodeck they wanted a boringly

00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:40,429
predictable and utilitarian way to

00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:45,169
access that information an unordered

00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:46,789
list may be examples of obtrusive design

00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,299
as they exist on the web are a little

00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:50,090
different

00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:52,849
I don't know about you I don't even like

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:57,799
one hamburger menu let alone three of

00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:59,779
them it's not excitement that produces

00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,099
patterns like this I don't think maybe I

00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:03,440
god I hope not

00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:05,929
but a sort of unwillingness or inability

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,200
to address the unsustainable growth of

00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:11,179
an application over time eminently

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,909
usable designs and architectures result

00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:16,999
when simplicity is the default it's one

00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:19,519
of the iron laws it's why unstyled HTML

00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:21,259
just works it so beautifully solves the

00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,690
problem of presenting documents to the

00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:25,609
screen that we don't consider all of the

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:29,330
careful thought that went into its jaw

00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:33,739
achingly boring presentation now I'm not

00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:35,440
holding a torch aloft and in marshalling

00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:37,249
the Village People and demand that we

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,739
transport ourselves back to the

00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:42,109
aesthetics of 1994 that would just

00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:44,869
that's absurd and it's antithetical to

00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:46,609
the spirit of progress but I do think

00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:49,220
that this ideal is something that we can

00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:51,590
carry on in our daily work especially

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,830
when more websites are consumed as web

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:57,139
apps we can make apps more resilient by

00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:00,289
adhering to semantics platform solutions

00:21:57,139 --> 00:22:02,269
and progressive enhancement and as it

00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:04,489
stands we're accustomed to serving heaps

00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:06,559
of div burgers on silver platters of

00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,710
JavaScript that not everyone can access

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,089
in all the places they may need to

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,639
accessibility advocates aren't lecturing

00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:14,960
you and screaming at you to use semantic

00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:19,399
HTML because it's Joe

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,020
like so much fun you'll pass out but

00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:23,360
because it's well understood how people

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,440
benefit from it the built-in

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,059
functionality you get from those

00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,980
semantics allows you to travel lighter

00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:30,590
as you won't need to build or install

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,940
accessible alternatives does this mean

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,919
your choice of tools are in direct

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,850
opposition to the goal of creating good

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,490
user experiences and depends depends on

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,960
how you use those tools it at least

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,270
requires us to understand the trade-offs

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:48,230
we might be making if we choose to use

00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:50,179
them so we need to bifurcate our focus

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,000
on what we learn we should learn

00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:54,710
frameworks and abstractions yes but we

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,360
also need to learn the platform api's

00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,760
that server that serve as their

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,330
foundation so that we can adapt more

00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:05,029
nimbly as the wind shifts the long-term

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,830
health of the web cannot be sustained if

00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:08,390
we ignore what the web platform brings

00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,809
to the table solely for our own

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:14,840
convenience and underscoring the

00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:16,909
importance of those fundamentals is the

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,649
fact that we're wired to want things to

00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:22,419
be boringly predictable

00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:27,169
we not only want it we expect it and

00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:29,600
subconsciously demand it so when things

00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:32,480
are predictable they embody the expected

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,340
qualities of the essential we don't want

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,990
any surprises with the planes landing

00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,890
gear as we come in for a landing

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:41,840
that is not excitement I can get behind

00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:44,299
this is an example of a critical fixture

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,820
and some of what we preside over as

00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:50,360
developers are also critical fixtures of

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:52,460
a sort these fixtures especially need to

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,260
remain fast and accessible part of

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,500
getting there necessarily involves

00:23:54,260 --> 00:24:01,429
relying more on HTML CSS and platform

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,440
api's to reduce overhead and if your

00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:05,899
reaction to what I'm saying is to assert

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,510
that this is boring work that will

00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:11,570
create boring websites that users will

00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:13,700
find boring then I must viciously retort

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,320
with the emergence of reader mode

00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:19,429
features that exist in several browsers

00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,679
at its core reader mode is just a boring

00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:23,870
mode toggle that strips away scripts and

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:28,370
styles to distill a page down to its

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,840
core content people are so tired of

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,669
grass

00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,250
playing with stuttering script Laden

00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,779
pages that they'll gladly strip away

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,289
everything exciting to get to that

00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:40,809
crucial nugget of content more easily

00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:43,870
still reader mode won't work everywhere

00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:45,880
and we shouldn't expect it to its

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,500
intended application for is for written

00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,409
content like articles not rich

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,500
applications solving human problems does

00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:56,679
require a human touch after all and so

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,679
to that end we are wired as human beings

00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,029
to want external consistency which is

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,399
when an object's function and

00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:05,409
recognizable appearance is reinforced by

00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:08,620
other similar implementations in the

00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:11,200
environment imagine a house with zero

00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,970
external consistency we're turning on

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,159
turning the knob on the stove changes

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,630
the television channel or flipping the

00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:19,000
lights which flushes the toilet

00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:21,159
and as Eric Bailey notes in an article

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,779
on a list apart and I highly recommend

00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,789
you read this and follow him he is an

00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:27,549
excellent person in the accessibility

00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:29,950
field browsers themselves are flush with

00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:31,659
examples of external consistency and we

00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,490
would do well to ensure that we don't

00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:38,529
break those externally consistent

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:40,120
behaviors now I am fully aware of the

00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:42,789
danger of saying this on stage at a

00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:46,419
JavaScript conference so hold your

00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:48,130
tomatoes for a second but one of the

00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,169
most common subversions of external

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:54,490
consistency in browsers is the single

00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:56,289
page application or s.p.a my personal

00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,840
inclination is to avoid building sites

00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:01,630
as SBA's this isn't because I hate them

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,640
or I don't understand how they work or I

00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:07,390
think they're filthy filthy dirty awful

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,580
things it's just that the behavior they

00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:12,640
replace is one that browsers already do

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:15,789
very well when we decide to take on the

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,340
task of implementing that ourselves we

00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:20,039
are taking on a lot of unnecessary

00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,630
responsibilities and risks in many cases

00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:26,230
how browsers navigate from page to page

00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:28,510
is part of a specification arrive to

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,760
after a deliberative process of debate

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:34,360
and consensus and continual improvement

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,909
and in my opinion it takes a whole lot

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,200
of courage with just a dash of hubris to

00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:41,760
assume we can do this better than

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,890
browsers have done in 25 or so years

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,230
and when a client-side router is used

00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,090
accessibility can become a casualty in

00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,980
that effort there's a whole host of

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,830
things we end up reinventing or miss

00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,590
altogether or shift beneath us as things

00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,360
change history must be managed tabindex

00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,730
and scrolling position must be accounted

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,600
for navigation cancelling can fail and

00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:06,930
so on even if we get client-side routing

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:10,140
just perfect there's another problem we

00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:12,210
have to grapple with which is when we

00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,800
neglect to send server generated markup

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,990
in favor of rendering everything on the

00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,160
client an app's contents are not only

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:21,720
inaccessible if and when when by the way

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:26,070
JavaScript fails but loading performance

00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,660
suffers as well when we serve content

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,910
from the server sure we lose that

00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,940
snappiness after the initial load I will

00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:35,280
concede that gladly but we retain that

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:38,790
external consistency that people respect

00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,160
or expect sorry that's not to say that

00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,290
we can never use client-side routers if

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,360
you provide server-side versions of all

00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:48,030
your client-side routes people will have

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,670
a way to access your site from literally

00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:54,630
any context whether it's a link from the

00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:56,220
outside or an internal link and then if

00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,900
components are attached to server side

00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,210
markup through client side hydration

00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,460
people are going to get a progressively

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,140
enhanced experience that gives us

00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,490
freedom a lot of freedom to try

00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,470
different things perhaps only the

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,260
authenticated part of your app as an SP

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,370
a or and I like this and I've been

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,110
experimenting with it a little

00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:16,140
perhaps client-side routing could be

00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,570
opted into as an app setting ensuring it

00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:22,740
only happens if people want it to where

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:26,810
we make no assumptions which brings me

00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:31,530
to my final point and the end of my talk

00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:33,780
no tool or any amount of automation will

00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,940
ever be a perfect substitute for a

00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,800
human's judgement which is a which is

00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,060
finely honed over years of experience

00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:44,970
solving human problems and solving human

00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,620
problems necessarily requires that you

00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:50,700
accept that humans have limitations

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,380
either inherent or imposed it also

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,180
requires you to accept that the tools

00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,070
you use can fail you in some ways

00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:00,220
and your judgment is necessary in those

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,170
situations now let me tell you another

00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:05,320
story

00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,970
this is stanislav petrov he was a

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,040
lieutenant colonel in the soviet air

00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,790
forces during a dangerously tense period

00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:15,520
of the Cold War while he was on duty in

00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:17,740
1983 a brand-new Soviet missile

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,510
detection system reported that five

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,900
nuclear missiles were launched by the

00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,700
United States and on the way to Russia

00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,010
through a reason and no small amount of

00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:30,340
intuition he was convinced that the

00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:31,690
system was wrong in the moment he

00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,090
concluded that five missiles was

00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:37,420
illogical because the us strike would

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,890
have been all-out so he did not inform

00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,550
his superiors and therefore a

00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:44,890
retaliatory strike was never authorized

00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,340
he turned out to be right the system was

00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,830
wrong

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,740
turned out to be sunlight reflecting on

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:54,220
some clouds of both North Dakota that

00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,660
triggered the false positive so while

00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,550
we'll never know all the factors at play

00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,730
of the various levels of command in this

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:02,620
situation it is not unreasonable to

00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,240
speculate that his decision to

00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,180
disbelieve the tools at his disposal

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,010
when the time came for it may have

00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:13,420
averted a global nuclear war obviously

00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,770
no JavaScript engine here in this room

00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,410
will ever be charged with such a

00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,210
perilous decision I hope not let's hope

00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:25,600
that javascript isn't the mechanism on

00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:27,040
which that operates but I think it is a

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,340
great lesson about how the tools we

00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:32,110
depend on can still get things wrong if

00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,140
that was if that wasn't the case every

00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:38,560
github issues page would be a ghost town

00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:44,020
zero issues zero pr's a million stars

00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:45,730
for everyone yay so it is on us to

00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,220
realize and own up to our responsibility

00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:50,080
to people as well as how our preferences

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,360
as developers and the needs of real

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,120
people can intersect in a way that's

00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,280
mutually beneficial and knowing where

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,260
that intersection lies involves

00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,510
realizing that while an accessibility

00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:03,850
inspector can tell you what semantic

00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,860
elements you should use knowing why

00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:08,000
those elements are preferable to a div

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,529
soup is just as vital

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,929
it's also realizing that y-you could

00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:15,029
install a layout framework such problems

00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:17,340
are best solved by relatively new and

00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:18,890
widely supported CSS layout modes such

00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,320
as flexbox and grid

00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:23,700
in fact if you want to create layouts

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,770
that catch the eye and push the

00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,570
boundaries beyond the ordinary you need

00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:30,059
to rely on these new layout modes

00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:33,000
you can't keep kicking that bootstrap

00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:34,890
can down the road people because not

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,750
only is the overhead of bootstrap

00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:39,149
ownerÃ­s it's just not where the web is

00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:41,100
is destined to go nor will it allow you

00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:43,620
access to the full power of these new

00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:48,299
layout modes there are people called UI

00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:50,190
engineers hire them for all of my

00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:52,409
whinging about the evils of JavaScript

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,450
and all the simple excitement it and its

00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:56,520
framework brethren brain I firmly

00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,260
believe it has its place this is not a

00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,080
diatribe against JavaScript

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:03,120
I believe javascript is great it's given

00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,480
a lot of us a living and I'm thankful

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,039
for that but we do need to rebalance our

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,520
use of it against other parts of the web

00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:12,809
platform javascript is most resilient

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,630
when we can use it with progressive

00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:17,549
enhancement in mind that's to say when

00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,250
we can build a baseline everyone

00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:22,440
benefits from and then add that

00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,210
candy-coating to enhance usability

00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,399
further for those who can benefit from

00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:29,720
it we're not just building better user

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:33,059
experiences but more inclusive ones and

00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,580
that to me is the really good work

00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:37,350
that's worth doing because inclusivity

00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,720
is not something we should just make

00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:43,649
room for at conferences it needs to be a

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:46,260
part of our daily work if you care about

00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:48,990
the web as I know you all do because if

00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,429
you're here you definitely care you'll

00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,500
come to find out that this approach to

00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:55,590
our work isn't boring at all but really

00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,740
quite rewarding we have two objectives

00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:00,539
as developers one work to make things

00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,500
better this week than they were last

00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:05,730
week and to continue our education to

00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:10,200
ensure the success of the first

00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:13,230
objective I genuinely truly believe our

00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,510
work can never be boring so long as it

00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:18,240
helps us deliver on these objectives in

00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:21,210
the spirit of making the web faster more

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:25,290
accessible and therefore more usable

00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:31,370
for everyone every where thank you

00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:44,660
[Applause]
