Title: Tour de Bikeshare: Setting World Records with JavaScript - Kyle Hill - JSConf US 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-11
Playlist: JSConf US 2019
Description: 
	In the summer of 2019, a somewhat out-of-shape software developer had a terrible idea — to use JavaScript to derive the algorithm that powers Washington DC’s bikeshare system and then try to set a one day record helping other people get where they want to go.

In this talk, we’ll learn about how humans can deduce machine learning, how you can turn yourself into your own API, and about how 250 years of history and a few million years of geology influences everyone that lives, works, and plays in our nation’s capital.

Can our heroic speaker overcome DC’s climate, the L’Enfant Plan, AND his own laziness to break a world record? Probably not, but let’s find out together!

>> Cool, hi, friends. I want to make a disclaimer before I start this talk. I think there are

00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,570
a lot of really important talks that are happening at JSConf this year, including the one that's

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,650
happening over in the next room right now and those talks are on important topics that

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,340
can help us as technologists make the world a more accessible, equitable and honestly

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,800
affirming place for everybody and then there's this talk, my name is Kyle Hill and I live

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,120
in Washington, D.C. and these days I'm a code schoolteacher that works with new developers.

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,700
This is a story about terrible ideas. Specifically through The Lens of a terrible idea that I

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,530
had and executed this summer. In 2010, the DC government introduced a docked

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:49,590
bikeshare system called capital bikeshare. For a while it was the largest such system

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:58,180
in the entire world, at least until New York City installed theirs a few years later. At

00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:04,890
this point there's 564 stations across the DC area with more still being added every

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,420
week. Seriously, they installed this station when I was writing in a bar about two weeks

00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:14,430
ago right in front of me. So any of the solar powered station, you can use your credit card

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,400
or RFID key ID which looks like this, to rent a bike, take it anywhere for a half hour like

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,720
a library book, wait for the green light and happy acknowledgment sound to go off, and

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:34,130
walk away. The bikes themselves are -- you know what? We're going to be positive and

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:42,860
uplifting here today. They're heavy. Each one weighs about 40 pounds, which means that

00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:50,480
they're durable, the handlebars have a very, very sticky adhesive grip. Sometimes the front

00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,890
brakes don't work, sometimes the back brakes don't work. These are not mutually exclusive

00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,450
conditions. [laughter]

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:05,530
And the turning radius is approximately the size of this stage that I'm standing on for

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:14,380
safety? So they're not actually fixies, though, they have three gears each. Which have their

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:30,730
uses. For the first gear, there's -- and for the second gear you're actually climbing the

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:48,570
Tourmalet in the tour de France and the third gear is literally everything else. But it's

00:02:48,570 --> 00:03:01,690
public infrastructure and nine years on from when the station why is first installed, a

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:13,650
lot of the original bikes are still in use with just like a modicum of upkeep and I really

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:25,680
do mean it when I call it an infrastructure, because in a weekday in nice weather you'll

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,790
have 20,000 trips in the course of a day. There are literally thousands of people in

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:43,840
the DC area that will use capital bikeshare to get to work in the morning and to get to

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:55,580
home in the evening except not really to home, just close to home? So I know this is a talk

00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:03,530
about JavaScript and stuff, but I want to take a really indulgent minute to talk about

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:11,311
my actual favorite topic in the whole world Washington, D.C. So let's put 60 seconds on

00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:20,760
the clock, and, ready? All right did the captioner get all yo, give it up?! : All right, deep

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:44,840
breath. Scroll on fun. One side effect to the L'Enfant Plan is that the big important

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,380
buildings like the Federal Government like departments and the law enforcement agencies,

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,330
they're all built in this downtown core, and if your company wants to work with politicians

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,960
and the Federal Government, you probably want to have your office right next to their office,

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,440
right? Well, DC has this really fun law called the height of buildings act. Congress passed

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:10,860
it in 1910 and while there are a lot of wild myths that go around about being no taller

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,030
than the Capitol dome or something. It actually restricts the residential buildings to be

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:22,020
no taller than the width of the street they're on functionally caps it at 15 or 20 stories

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:29,510
for our skyscrapers. Law dictates that if there's a limited amount

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:39,330
of proximate space to work downtown, eventually there won't be much space to live downtown

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:51,430
and that's kind of what happened. I call it the law of Massachusetts Avenue. Essentially

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,850
the neighborhoods north of this line are where people live and play and neighborhood south

00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,030
of this line are where the tourists are, and where people's offices are, and the four,

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:05,020
you know, branches of the Federal Government, the White House, Congress, the Supreme Court,

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,051
and Aladdin the musical, the Kennedy Center. There's also the elevation problem. This is

00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:16,110
the 15th street north cycle track. It was built back in 2010 to coincide with capital

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:24,350
bikeshare and it runs all the way to Columbia heights, which is called that for a reason.

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:30,510
There is this one stretch my friend Eli's place used to be on that hill right next to

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:36,260
that white pickup truck. Trust me, walking up that hill sucks, it's a 9% grade went.

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,020
tour de France riders struggle with that. You know there's that one bikeshare station

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:50,400
right at the bottom of the hill, you kind of slide in there, but then the bikes don't

00:06:50,400 --> 00:07:01,980
rebalance right, so these problems aren't unique to DC of course, and so the company

00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:09,139
that runs our bikeshare system and a dozen others around the country employ these people

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:14,350
to drive around all day in rebalancing vans, moving bikes from place to place and sometimes

00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,650
this isn't enough, so this past year they introduced a program called Bike Angels, which

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:26,740
is basically that, but for you, and now we can finally talk about my terrible idea.

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,081
I have have to be honest here, I don't really have a great origin story for this. I remember

00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:38,160
specifically going to a bar and talking to my friend, and telling her, hey, I have this

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,010
idea. I want to set the record for most Bike Angels points in a single day, and she looked

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,270
at me, drinking my fourth beer and smoking a clove and kind of tilted her head and visibly

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:57,070
ran through an entire list of questions in her head before finalling settling on how?

00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:03,889
And I remember confidently responding with technology. Every 15 minutes the Bike Angels

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:10,289
code looks at the number of available bikes and docks at a station and compares it to

00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:17,560
what it expects demand will be at the stations and assigns those 1, 2, or 3 points for taking

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:25,130
a bike out or putting a bike back in. If you take a bike from somewhere else to a work

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:33,050
station, you'll get points. If you take a bike from a black station to a white station,

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,759
you'll get both. The system kind of has some edge cases predicated

00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,279
around you can't take a bike from a black station to another black station. The whole

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,410
goal is to actually encourage people to rebalance things but not just move them around. but

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:55,050
you've gamified the thing. What's the best way to get people to actually use it. Well,

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,889
here's a live updating monthly leaderboard with all the people who have opted into the

00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:06,550
program that have points and at the bottom of that page is this curious little section

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,929
called record holders and the record was 124 points for a single day.

00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:23,940
I could beat that! Right? ! >> OK, so the maximum number of points you

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,930
could get on any individual ride is 6. That's 3 out and 3 in. I would need to do 21 of those

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:35,399
in a day at least if I was going to break that record. If there's any way to predict

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,800
how the algorithm is going to pop up points I'm going to need to know where that is. Luckily

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,330
capital bikeshare publishes historical CSVs going all the way back to 2010 of every single

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:52,800
trip that's been taken when and where and they also have this end point that has a list

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,999
of all of the stations, the current number of points and bikes and empty docks, the GPS

00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:05,029
coordinates. It's not exactly an API, but I've been using it for about five years to

00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:08,089
teach new code school students how to do AJAX, so thanks for the benign neglect. I wrote

00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:18,230
some code to scrape all this data every 30 minutes. And just let it run for a few weeks.

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,709
In the meantime I made sure to get around town as much as I could, partially to memorize

00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:26,329
all the one-way bike lines, but partially to mess around with expectations. Say I took

00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:35,569
a bike out of a station, would it take a while the algorithm to assign points to that station?

00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:44,470
What I found out pretty quickly is that while the

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:50,410
assignment of points to a station is partially a function of the number of bikes and docks

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,550
there, there's something more sophisticated, more machine learningy going on in the code

00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:01,100
that makes doing it a practical impossibility. It sure seems like the algorithm takes into

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,749
account the following: Visits from the rebalancing van. The day of the week. The weather, the

00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,790
historical demand at this time of day, the historical demand at this time of year, AKS,

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:21,809
is it the spring or the fall. So deduction is going to be impossible here, but what about

00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:28,920
induction? If I can come up with a lot -- I can make some logical assumptions and guesses

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,550
about how this algorithm works, I can try to do them and until they're like disproven,

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:41,149
I can use them to try and maximize points for a minimal effort. At this point, it just

00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:49,110
becomes video game and I'm playing it against the computer. In a way it's kind of like endurance

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:57,119
kinesthetic speed-running and my controller is on my keychain. So after I had that few

00:11:57,119 --> 00:12:05,009
weeks' scraped data, I built this data visualization tool. By the way if you want to know a really

00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:10,110
terrible idea that you shouldn't do, it's building your own map component in React.

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,800
Like, cartography is a serious problem, well beyond my level of expertise. But you can

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,989
drag this and kind of see it update and the red stations are where points are available

00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:25,069
and you know, the bigger and redder they are, the more -- the blue ones are where points

00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:31,189
are available for, you know, taking bikes out and you can see that the downtown area

00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:38,480
is a good one for taking points out and more and more people are going to full station

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,629
that you can't put a bike in, where people live in Columbia heights is going to be full

00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:50,110
because of that and we fast forward all the way to evening rush, you'll see that it sort

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:56,259
of flips the script a little bit. Downtown are more points because there are more people

00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:00,809
who want to use capital bikeshare than there are bikes downtown and this big circle right

00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:07,379
here is right next to Florida Avenue it was the station that we looked at earlier and

00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:15,569
there are a lot of people who will park their bike there and not want to ride their bike

00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:21,809
up the hill and who can blame them. 15 and 35 past the hour the points would change for

00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:29,139
a station if it was no longer full or no longer empty, but at the top of the hour, everything

00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:35,779
changed. My guess is that historical expectations of demand are bucketed into the hours of day.

00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:41,470
And dramatically influence the calculations for the subsequent four segments. Some basic

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:51,100
math told me that if I focused on 12.4 points her hour, that's a reasonable segment, and

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:59,790
especially if I could leverage the higher point values during morning or evening rush.

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:07,449
I did some test is and it was going I was going to need to look for a nearby station

00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:13,689
pairs with point asymmetries, but over the course of a few hours of lunch breaks I felt

00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:18,499
confident I could actually find them and pull them off. So on Monday, July 15th, I decided

00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:25,189
to go for it. So for record attempt No. 1, spoiler alert. I started after breakfast in

00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:39,720
a pretty residential part of town. All I needed to do was find a bike and take it there, and

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:50,579
there was a reason why they were awarded points, the closest station was a kilometer walk away.

00:14:50,579 --> 00:15:05,189
First ride was worth 5 points. From there, I realized that there was another station

00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:20,179
that was nearby, and I could get a 3-point ride out of that. Drove it on the sidewalk

00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:35,910
contra flow of the traffic for longer than I'm confident to admit. Started getting into

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:45,170
a groove of taking bikes from downtown to slightly further uptown. At 10:10 I found

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:55,420
a station pair. That was worth 4 points. But at 10:14 when the thing changed over, I realized

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:04,269
that there was now a 200-meter difference with station pair worth 4 points and in the

00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:15,160
next segment I hit that five times. I ran between stations. There were definitely people

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:28,430
looking at their phones being like, who are you? Then I got an iced coffee, because it

00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:41,579
was a little bit hotter out than I thought it was going to be, but I sent a text to my

00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:53,910
friends saying hey, I'm on an incredible pace, I'm going to be done in half an hour.

00:16:53,910 --> 00:17:02,669
Then the expectations started to change and the points dried up dramatically. The metro

00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:10,190
center station was worth a lot of points because it was full, but there weren't really many

00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:19,050
places to put the bikes there, so I started shifting them literally wherever I could around

00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:28,970
downtown and then the stationed started to be worth fewer points so I went on a little

00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:36,290
bit of an experimental ride down towards the wharf. It's a new development in DC the tool

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,440
told me there would probably be some nice point asymmetries around 12:00, so rode all

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:49,840
the way across downtown and said a faint cuss word because I was now surrounded with no

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:59,620
points around a kilometer. So that kind of has a problem and I parked my bike in a now-full

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:06,340
station and was experiencing some consequences like dehydration and Kyle, you should have

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:14,640
put on sun block. I made my way to a station that was near a lunch place and parked it

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,050
and when I got halfway across the sidewalk I realized the consequences of what I'd done

00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:31,390
which is that the station was probably now going to have points for the next 10 minutes.

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:42,340
So instead of getting Gatorade or sandwich, or making smart decisions I decided to just

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:57,090
keep going. So at 12:30 that station was worth 2 points for taking a bike out and again,

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:02,550
I just took them to wherever I could possibly go. A and instead of making smart decisions

00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:10,280
I got up north of 60 points and by the end of this hour, I actually took a bike from

00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:18,660
one neighborhood to another. Crossing the 63-point halfway mark and then I really started

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,910
experiencing consequences. So Monday was supposed to have nice weather

00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:33,650
and it ended up being 94 degrees Fahrenheit for anyone who's been in DC in the summer.

00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:39,130
I might have been better trying to hang out in the shade but all those solar-powered bike

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:48,050
stations not gonna help out. I got it to the metro, took it to a station, looked at the

00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,070
map, say there was a possible 2-point ride that would get me from nearby to the station

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:58,840
that was next to my house, and if you're going to be honest, I knew that I was probably done

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:06,900
at that particular moment. Parked the bike, looked at my phone. I had 8% battery left

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:15,970
and I was shattered physically in a very real way and I went home and I went to sleep.

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,300
And that was record attempt No. 1. [applause]

00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:25,310
Why are you applauding? I failed. So I will admit that my preparation for record attempt

00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:30,780
No. 1 was maybe a little suboptimal. There was definitely room for improvement.

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:37,790
But I couldn't try again for a while, as the entire East Coast immediately started experiencing

00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:46,010
the worst heat wave of the summer. The next 8 days, the high temperature stayed north

00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:58,550
of 95 in DC with the heat index in the 110s. To give you an idea right now outside in San

00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:06,640
Diego, where the weather is pretty consistently gorgeous, the heat index is 72. So that's

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:18,770
in direct sunlight, where I was all day. No BS, even standing in a 110 heat index even

00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:29,170
for five minutes is not just uncomfortable, but dangerous, but let's pretend that I prepared

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:35,090
correctly. Let's assume I made smarter routing decisions.

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:46,910
If the question I asked like, 125 slides ago was, can I do this? Can I score more than

00:21:46,910 --> 00:22:00,130
120 points in a single day? I think the answer is yeah, I think I actually can. It's definitely

00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:07,880
possible at least. You know, the algorithm has weak points and I successfully exploited

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:18,240
some of them to get as close as I can. So all my free time for the next week or so was

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:25,610
focused on building tools to make those assumptions true. First off, let's take a look at the

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:35,740
paths I can take. It's fine to look at the distance between stations as the crow flies,

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:44,760
but it turns out that a lot of people are not cool with me riding through their lobby.

00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,510
Etc. The quantity of asphalt that I'm ever going

00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:57,860
to actually see is going to shrink dramatically. From that I kind of realized that I could

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:07,030
turn all of the stations and the one-way bike lanes into a directed graph. And it's pretty

00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:12,840
easy to calculate the measurements between those two points if you just use the great

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:20,040
circle formula, but the other part that sucks is a lot -- just so much, is going uphill

00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,640
and luckily there's the Open Elevation API, so I ran all those Node locations against

00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:32,620
it and since this is a directed graph, I could figure out a rough approximation of the elevation

00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:42,170
gain going each way and by mapping together the distance and hills on each vector, I was

00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:48,220
able to reason out a single effort value between each pair of stations in each direction, and

00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,930
that makes this just a traveling salesman problem.

00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,490
Next up is routing. So after a few hours ever race-walking. I really started to back-slide.

00:23:54,490 --> 00:24:05,470
I could look at the current map and find you some smart decisions to make within a few

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:16,550
seconds, because I've spent way too much time looking at that map. But if I'm outside, I'm

00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:24,300
less capable, I have less tools and I'm also getting consistently tired, but what if I

00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:31,060
could outsource my own decisionmaking here? So over the next couple of days I hacked together

00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:39,010
a real quick and dirty, like why would anyone use tricatcher error conditions a React app

00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:48,390
that let me input the station and it considered that defined distance elevation metric, all

00:24:48,390 --> 00:25:03,040
this great data and the current state of affairs and figured out a nearby station pair predicated

00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:11,660
on my logic that would make that the best station to make. But don't worry, all this

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:18,900
gets terrible because I had concerns about my cell phone battery and Chrome chewed through

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:26,260
that really fast. So why not look at some phantom JS logic. At the center bottom you've

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:32,390
got that last trip thing and it changes every time that I've finished a trip near instantaneously.

00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:37,640
Why not just write some code to look for when that updates, assume that I'm at the end station

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,290
and that I want another ride and then just make one call to the decisionmaking API and

00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,350
the second call to Twilio, and just send me a text message with stats and directions and

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,070
occasional random encouragement!

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,920
[laughter] And now I was ready to give this another shot.

00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,430
Wednesday the 24th was going to be the day with possibly the nicest weather in DC all

00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:58,080
summer. 83 degree, yes, I know, San Diego, yes, I know. Partly cloudy and low humidity.

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,040
Home stretch, y'all, let's do this. So the day started out with a 3-point ride within

00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,300
my own neighborhood. Within 10 seconds of docking I had a text message from API me.

00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:15,270
It said to go down the street, get mother bike, then do that route. I got another text

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:20,650
message. I'm fast forwarding through this all because there was absolutely no drama

00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:28,010
in the mornings. Everything worked perfectly which is never what you'd expect from a hack

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,170
project. The higher system-wide demand made it less than optimal. I was riding at a sustainable

00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:40,810
pace, I was hydrating, I was applying some luck, I was eating, I took a lunch break and

00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:48,560
I ran to my friend Alexis, Alexis and I worked together a couple of jobs ago and she asked

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:55,080
me, what are you up to? I think that she meant what is your current employer, and what I

00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,220
interpreted that as, was a little bit more in the moment. See, some ideas like this,

00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,630
are inscrutable. If something made enough sense to be able to explain the how and why

00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:03,840
to someone in the time it takes to assemble a sandwich, it's probably not that terrible

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,840
of an idea, and you're also not the only person to have had it. No, the most terrible ideas

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,410
are tragically personal. They are arts of the kind that only you'll ever know how to

00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,840
make, and they happen to people, not for people. Until they get pursued, they just kind of

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,240
live as this ethereal unexplainable dream. Like, who wants to listen to some guy talk

00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,110
about bikeshare points for half an hour? [laughter]

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:27,559
So after lunch I went to Union Station and since that's the one big blue dot that came

00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:33,830
up and for the next two hours I moved bikes over and over and over again to the same station

00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:40,720
that was right outside of the supermarket. The station was next to a window ledge where

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,140
the employees would take their breaks and walk me walk over every ten minutes like a

00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,559
Russian doll time loop. I really wonder what they thought I was doing. So I emptied a couple

00:27:50,559 --> 00:28:01,580
of stations with the help of a group of very, very confused tourists and that's when I sent

00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:07,991
a text to my wife, hey, Kate, I'm on a great pace. I'm going to be done by happy hour!

00:28:07,991 --> 00:28:10,800
At 2:45 the points updated. That station that I completely emptied, it was now worth points

00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,500
for sure for taking bikes out of it. Bikes that did not presently exist. I'm not entirely

00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:22,920
sure what I had done to the Bike Angels algorithm in that moment.

00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,951
What untested and ununknown code you had just uncovered, but honestly I think I instantiated

00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:29,951
a corner case so strange, alien and novel that I think it just instinctively started

00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:30,951
defending itself. [laughter]

00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:31,951
OK, capital hill stopped being more fruitful with points. The API wasn't going to be helpful

00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:32,951
here so I realized that I could get across town but I needed to get there fast so I took

00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:33,951
the metro across town and I ran up the escalator and I think that's when I turned my ankle.

00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:34,951
I'm not sure but from this moment on, walking sucked. Which was not great, because the API

00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:35,951
kept sending me to places over and over and over again, that were farther and farther

00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:36,951
away as the points disappeared off the map. And I hit triple doubling it's, but now I'm

00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:37,951
really kind of feeling it and it's hot and I'm tired and exhausted, and here was the

00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:38,951
real problem. At 4:17 I took a bike out and took it about three blocks away and the API

00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:39,951
crashed. See, it turns out quick and dirty hacks, should still throw tricatch in there

00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:40,951
and there's a station blocks away, I did that four times, 5:00 hits, no more points around

00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:41,951
for a kilometer in every direction and I just plopped down there right on the sidewalk and,

00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:42,951
(sighs) sent some text messages and gave it some thought and called for a Lyft to go home.

00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:43,951
You know that feeling when you're utterly exhausted and you desperately need no part

00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:44,951
of your body to ever touch any other part of your body? That's me on my bed with my

00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:45,951
internal monologue giving me a wonderful lecture, because I don't have any other entertainment

00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:52,690
because I can't move my body and it went like this: "Kyle, what are you doing? What are

00:28:52,690 --> 00:29:02,600
you trying to accomplish here? Do you think anyone's going to understand what you're doing?

00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:08,070
Do YOU understand what you're doing? You quit everything you ever do. About 80% of the way

00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:19,061
through. I mean, look at that map you just showed before. Why -- why do you think this

00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:23,930
will be any different? "And you smell awful," and point my senses and my internal monologue

00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:32,770
agreed and so I walked very gingerly over into the shower and turned it on and just

00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,960
stood there for five, ten minutes, mind blank, blistered, exhausted, sore, and I thought

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,670
about a text message I got from my wife right after I told her I was gonna quit.

00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:44,660
And I -- ... I started to feel a little better, at least my ankle did. And I thought, I can

00:29:44,660 --> 00:30:07,380
make it to happy hour, I think. I don't want to walk there. I can't walk there. I sure

00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,309
don't want to drive. I suck at that but I could bike over.

00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:18,650
[laughter] So y'all seem smart, so you probably already

00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:28,760
know how this ends. The fun part of terrible ideas is that while they cannot be explained

00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:37,460
to any other person ever, if you pursue them to their logical conclusion, they leave a

00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:45,250
beautiful corpse. I have code that I wrote for this. With really good ideas that it generated.

00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:54,230
I have a rekindled love for JavaScript in the city that I live in. I have a very interesting

00:30:54,230 --> 00:31:01,080
life lesson that I honestly came by that taught me things about persistence and determination.

00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:10,830
I have a story to tell about the time I set a world record for bikeshare points, by why

00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:17,410
biking 41 miles and walking a half-marathon and that story includes the time I took the

00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:24,880
very last bike out from that station right below Mery Hill park and that very day the

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:35,610
skies opened and I rode through the most celebratory thunderstorm I will ever experience. Not an

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,120
obstacle thrown in my way through an algorithm, but a real, alive, visceral experience. I'm

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,490
never going to forget it and I remember walking into the very crowded bar afterwards, soaked

00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:53,850
to the skin, and Kate handed me that promised margarita, and she introduced me to her brand

00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,850
new colleague and he asked me: "So what did you do today?"

00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,480
[laughter] That's all I got.

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,000
