	Original Title: “WTF does 'run' mean?” And other adventures in helping someone learn to code

2019 is simultaneously a wonderful and also terrifying time for a newcomer to learn to code. There are so many resources out there! Awesome! But also, there are so many resources out there! Where does anyone even start? As a self taught engineer who’s been involved in building things on the web since the early 2000’s, helping a friend with zero previous experience prepare for, and get through, learning to be a junior engineer in 2019 was an eye opening experience – and in turn taught me a lot about being a better engineer.
