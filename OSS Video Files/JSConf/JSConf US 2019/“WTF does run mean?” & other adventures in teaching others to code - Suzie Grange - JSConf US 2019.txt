	Original Title: “WTF does 'run' mean?” And other adventures in helping someone learn to code

2019 is simultaneously a wonderful and also terrifying time for a newcomer to learn to code. There are so many resources out there! Awesome! But also, there are so many resources out there! Where does anyone even start? As a self taught engineer who’s been involved in building things on the web since the early 2000’s, helping a friend with zero previous experience prepare for, and get through, learning to be a junior engineer in 2019 was an eye opening experience – and in turn taught me a lot about being a better engineer.

WTF Does 'Run' Mean?

00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,160
And Other Adventures in Helping Someone Learn to Code

00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,160
- Suzie Grange

00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,160
>> Hello.

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,160
There we go.

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,160
Welcome back everyone!

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,160
Again, I'm sorry about the snacks.

00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,160
[laughter]

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,160
So our next speaker, Suzie Grange, and Suzie is going to talk to us about what it's like

00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
to teach a friend to code in 2019.

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
Suzie, although she is an interesting person, she couldn't come up with any fun facts on

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
her own, however, I have pulled a couple out of her.

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
So Suzie is a musician as you will learn about in the talk and she came to New York in order

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,160
to found a startup that has like a really, really cool mission to help improve women's

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,160
health care which is a topic that is really near and dear to my heart, because I'm a woman

00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,160
and she went came to New York she said I'll leave all that band stuff behind and she quickly

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,160
discovered that she was wrong and she needs to make music and now she's making music again

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
and she's going to tell us about that in her talk.

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,160
So let's all give it up for Suzie.

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,160
>> Thank you.

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,160
All right, hi, everybody, Day 3, JSConf, we made it.

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
Thank you for coming to my talk.

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
So this is actually my first talk so please excuse my verbal typos.

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,189
So I want to kick things off with a quick show of hands.

00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:29,390
I say this but I can't really see y'all because it's kind of bright up here.

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,940
So here was once a junior engineer.

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,000
Trick question, friends.

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,190
And who considers themselves still to be a junior engineer right now.

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:47,899
Cool, well, you're in the right place and who considers themselves to be a senior engineer?

00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,899
Cool.

00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,310
And who considers themselves someone who knows everything there is to know about software

00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,310
development?

00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,579
[laughter] Oh, I saw one hand.

00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:03,260
! Well, yeah, junior folks, as you can see from that, if you feel like you don't know

00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:11,230
enough right now, rest assured that you probably never will, so yay for that.

00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,870
So and what unites us all is that we all have to start somewhere, but that can be different

00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,190
places.

00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:23,251
Maybe you knew from the minute that you had a family PC that you knew you wanted to code.

00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:28,010
You knew you wanted to manipulate this machine or maybe inspired by customizing your my space

00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:34,370
profile or maybe you did computer science as a degree.

00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:39,520
Wherever we came from, we all ended up in this crazy journey.

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,650
So last summer my friend James decided to join us and he took the brave decision to

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,060
career change to become an engineer.

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,590
So me being a mostly decent human being, I offered to help, I mean how hard can it be

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,630
in 2019 with the finest Google search results and videos and courses online?

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,480
Well, spoiler, it was hard.

00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,570
Way harder than I thought or I think he even thought, to be honest.

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:12,380
So today I want to share ten things that I learned as I followed James on his coding

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,980
adventure.

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,980
My name is Suzie.

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,731
My pronouns are she/her, I am British, not Australian, so congrats for those of you who

00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:27,100
guessed that in the guess the accent sweep stakes and I work on the front-end tech lead

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,980
at Maven clinic in New York City.

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:43,960
We partner with employers to support their employees through pregnancy, surrogacy, adoption

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,780
and return to work programs.

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,690
So that's my shameless plug for now.

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,030
Also we're hiring, so if you're interested in either of those things, please come to

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,200
talk to me later.

00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,650
So my path into this is that I was self-taught or I like to call myself an accidental engineer.

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,700
See, music was always my thing.

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,540
When I picked up guitar at age 12, I kind of knew that was it for me, that was what

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,660
I wanted to do, so for the rest of my teens and early 20s, I spent most of my time playing

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,000
shows in dodgy dive bars and venues across the UK, but after playing my first show, I

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:33,900
think I was 14 or something, I was backing in the glory of success, I thought that the

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,020
this is the late '90s and early 20000, and I had no shortage of I inspiration.

00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:47,320
The web was full of fonts, and let's face it questionable design choice, they were great

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
times.

00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,320
So armed with cutting edge tools and zero experience I drag and dropped my way to creating

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,770
my first website.

00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,770
But then what?

00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,650
I had this thing on my computer and I knew I had to somehow get that onto the interwebs.

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,740
I heard that hosting was a thing, so I got some low-cost hosting, I think and I emailed

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:17,290
my band's email list and I asked if anyone knew any FTP sites.

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,630
With no skills, I had become a freaking webmaster.

00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,110
It was good times.

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:35,220
So sadly, archive.org didn't start until 2001, so my 1999 handiwork is lost to the ether,

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,030
but rest assured it looked pretty great.

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:46,650
This is all that remains of it.

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,250
Eventually I graduated from publisher to front page and then definitely very illegally obtained

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,050
of DreamWeaver.

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,970
Tables and frames came and went and CSS came along and allowed me to look pretty.

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,690
But still for me coding was a hobby.

00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:08,030
It wasn't a career if you had to do a career in computer science, you had to go and do

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,270
a degree in computer science, right, that's how it works?

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:17,310
So fast forward, I did a degree in music technology, I worked in retouching for a bit, I worked

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,030
in IT support for a bit.

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,340
I had something of a mid-20s crisis trying to figure out what I was doing with my life

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,020
in which I considered everything from being a lawyer to a teacher to a social worker and

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,090
then I heard about this startup scene thing that was happening in the US and that kind

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,570
of sounded like being in a band to me.

00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,750
You know, it's you and a bunch of people and you're creating this product that you're trying

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:45,360
to put out into the world in order to be successful and famous and happy or something so I figured

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,930
maybe I don't need a degree to do this.

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,070
So I decided to learn to code properly.

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:56,050
So I read some books, I built some bad PHP apps and I badgered some people on Twitter

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:07,250
until thankfully someone gave me a chance and gave me a code.

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,620
So I taught myself Ruby, discovered SVN and git and I taught myself JavaScript and here

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,860
I am today, giving my first talk at the biggest conference in our industry, so that's weird.

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
[applause]

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,850
Thank you.

00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:30,120
So just to recap, the things that I needed to do in order to become an accidental junior

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,280
developer, I pretty much needed to know HTML, some dodgy inline styles, I needed to know

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,460
how to use an FTP client and a generous smattering of GIFs, obviously.

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,889
So accidentally becoming a developer wasn't really that uncommon back then.

00:06:45,889 --> 00:07:02,139
Maybe as I said earlier, people started tinkering on MySpace profiles or maybe.

00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:09,470
Interactivity was pretty much copy and pasting a Java applet or maybe a Marquee if you were

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,230
particularly creative.

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,370
So here we are in 2019, meet my friend James.

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,570
We actually made music together.

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,860
But that's a story for another time.

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:26,520
But he had a real job in construction so he was basically building skyscrapers and swinging

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,520
off bridges and doing you know, real work but he also produced videos and animations

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,830
and sound design video games, so a talented guy in general.

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,680
So last summer he decided he wanted to learn to code.

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,419
So me being self-taught and having mostly learned through a baptism of fire was OK,

00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,419
how hard can it be?

00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:50,010
What do you need to know.

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:58,979
And to recap I got my first job knowing HTML, CSS, really bad PHP and that was kind of it.

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,100
Source control?

00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,400
I probably thought that was a foodstuff.

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,140
So this is what it turns out James had to learn.

00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,490
So he got the classics of HTML and CSS but in addition to that you have to know about

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:25,660
Sass and Less and CSS in JS and how to fight in Twitter about CSS in JS, JavaScript, obviously,

00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,990
React and Angular and Vue and whatever the cool kids are using right now and let's face

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,209
it there have probably been 3 JavaScript frames come out in the time that it's got me to this

00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:37,500
time in my talk.

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,259
Git, and databases and APIs and be a good citizen of the web and accessibility.

00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:51,670
If you want to get an interview, you into need to know about algorithm data structures,

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:57,190
cross-browser testing and whatever everyone is talking about in Hacker News this week,

00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,220
too.

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,170
So that brings me to thing No. 1 on my list and that that is is that the barrier for entry

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,100
is way higher now, like, damn.

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,690
So what are some ways folks get into engineering these days?

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:17,329
Well, seeing that you know Matrix star downloading information into your brain is not an option

00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:21,459
yet, CS degree.

00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:29,730
Fantastic, cost you many bags of money and take you four years but you'll be able to

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,939
contribute as a junior engineer pretty early on, or you can do the boot camp path which

00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:41,269
will cost you some bags of money and take you 12, 14 weeks and you'll be out being able

00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:47,300
to contribute again or you can do my path which was the self taught path, which could

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:54,129
cost you nothing to some amount depending on how much you put into it and it could take

00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,610
you any amount of time.

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:02,300
Which thinking about these things brought me to thing No. 2 is that coding isn't that

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,100
open to all when you think about it.

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,290
I'm not sure if you remember the code year initiative that happened I think it was around

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,720
2012 by things like then-mayor of New York, Bloomberg touted that he was going to learn

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,180
coding and if he could learn it anybody could do it.

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,399
It's open to all.

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,389
Why would you not want to do this.

00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:30,160
That's all well and good, but you need to remember that not everyone grows up access

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,660
to a computer.

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:40,009
Not everyone can spend 12 to 20K on tuition fees plus living expenses and loss of earnings.

00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:45,519
Not everyone is able to work a job or two or three and spend their time outside of work

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,519
learning to code.

00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:56,019
There are some great initiatives out there, there are loans out there, but it's still

00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:00,730
a huge commitment and there's no guarantee of how soon, if at all, you'll get a job.

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:07,329
So nevertheless, James chose the boot camp path and why would you not?

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:09,779
It promises a pretty amazing return on investment.

00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,780
It if you go from zero to being a developer in 12 weeks, you can according to some of

00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,050
these boot campsites have a 70X salary increase.

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,790
Sox of them even have money-back guarantees.

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:28,300
But again to get into top-tier boot camps a lot of them require you to have a lot of

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:35,120
knowledge in order to get into a camp that teaches you to learn code.

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,620
So that was weird.

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,889
So his school gave a few resources there but he decided he wanted to do a thorough job

00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:47,040
and figure out how he could best learn with the resources available to him.

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,339
Which brings me to thing 3 is there are so many resources out there.

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:58,600
When I started there was books and trying things and failing and that was kind of it.

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,949
But now there's so many things out there, which is great, right?

00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:04,690
There are so many choices but how do you know which one is best for you?

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,269
How do you know which learning style is best for you?

00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,269
Where should you start?

00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,269
Should you pay for one?

00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:16,660
Trying to figure out where these things start and which one works for you.

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,869
Nevertheless, James started with Code Academy.

00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:25,860
It's a great browser-based IDE which gives you hints.

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,079
It's really cool.

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,910
So his boot camp was going to involve Ruby.

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:42,550
So he did some code academy resources, eventually he could write methods and he could do simple

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,579
algorithms in his browser.

00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:50,199
He could Fibonacci, he could do Fizzbuzz, awesome, so I was feeling like a mental bad

00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,199
JavaScript.

00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:57,240
So I decided it would be a good idea for him to install Ruby locally.

00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:04,779
He went on this site and it had a bunch of commands with a dollar sign in front.

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:05,779
What even is that?

00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:11,440
So I replied oh, yeah, that just means you have to run those in your terminal, simple.

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,129
So he was like, yeah, but what does that even mean?

00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:16,989
What even is run?

00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:21,610
So for some reason that question hit me, not because I couldn't tell him to open up the

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:27,269
terminal app to copy and paste that website and hit return and that would do what he wanted

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:32,670
but I guess at that point I realized how much learning to code involved.

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:38,079
Short of run something you were just telling but even then, what does the dollar sign mean

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:44,129
and how do I explain those two fairly simple seeming things without explaining kind of

00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:48,399
everything in computer science so at that point it dawned on me that this journey he

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,829
was about to take was huge.

00:13:51,829 --> 00:14:01,470
He conquered Fizzbuzz and algorithms but he didn't know how that runs on a server or even

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,079
what a server was, all of these things that I, as I turns out kind of had forgotten were

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,949
not part of the common vernacular for nondevelopers.

00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,920
Which brings me to point 4.

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,290
Coding is kind of this giant game of joining the dots, but you don't know what the dots

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:26,749
are, and as soon as you join one dot, another 1 or 3 or 12 more start coming into view.

00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:36,439
Now, computer folks, this is not, you've got those fundamentals kind of down, but for boot

00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:40,879
stamp and self taught folks, sometimes we skim over those things in order to get productive

00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,240
fast and then we catch up later.

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,279
So for James he understood about running code in the computer versus server, he knew what

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,630
HTML was, we noticed some other ones, like what's an API, what's a database, all things

00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,940
that I had taken for granted as things everyone would have some knowledge of which it turns

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,160
out they don't.

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,429
He learned a bunch of Ruby and he passed the entrance exam for his boot camp of choice.

00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:13,279
Complete, awesome, but as it turns out, more knowledge means more questions.

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,199
He went through the bootcamp and we continued to meet up when he wanted help with something.

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,569
He built some Ruby apps and moved to JavaScript and eventually build full-stack Rails and

00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:25,799
React.

00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:30,149
But the more you learn, the more questions arise.

00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:33,569
Ah, console errors.

00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:41,749
These can be useful for 70% of the time but for a new developer this seemingly never-ending

00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:48,480
stream of scary red text can feel meaningless.

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,759
I'm pretty sure everyone in this room has Googled that at some point.

00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,420
So what next?

00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,529
Over to Google, right?

00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:05,319
And then you get met with a casual 15 million results and within those results, a plethora

00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:09,709
of probably passive-aggressive StackOverflow answers to sift through.

00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,350
Always fun.

00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,029
And that's if you know what the issue is and if you don't know what the issue is, how do

00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:17,230
you know what to Google?

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,579
And even if you do, how to you phrase the question in order to get the search results

00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:22,579
you need?

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:28,549
Early on, James had been prepending his searches with JScript thinking it was short for JavaScript

00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:31,959
which returned some pretty short results.

00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:40,359
And in the interest of googling: React class, it's pretty huge in terms of the relevancy

00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:48,069
of your results and that's if you have a stack trace to begin with.

00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:51,809
I guess I'd kind of taken for granted how second nature it had become for me to just

00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:56,439
search things and usually get the right answer and how to debug things when issues arose,

00:16:56,439 --> 00:17:01,999
learning to code is as much about learning to debug as it is about writing code in the

00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:05,310
first place, as it turns out.

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:11,010
So James learned about debugging and built some frankly impressive apps for someone who

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:24,020
only to code a few weeks ago.

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,260
So his school set out some guidelines as to what to do, to begin with the good chance

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,000
of getting a new job.

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,630
One of those guidelines was to apply to 50 jobs a week.

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,430
Five-zero jobs a week, that's kind of a lot.

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:42,140
In addition to that he had to study algorithm, create new projects, work on technical interview

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:49,160
skills, work on general interview skills, things like a life had to factor in there,

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,350
work on his resume, and practice whiteboarding.

00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,690
If you're lucky, you get to do code challenges and prep for interviews.

00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,860
But still it's a lot of stuff.

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,170
And all of that is exactly because competition is so fierce right now.

00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:10,280
There was 20,000 boot camp grads in 2018 and no doubt more than that in 2019, something

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,370
like 65,000 computer science grads and how many self-taught folks common to the market

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,700
each year, which is great because in the USA there are plenty of software jobs out there

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,791
but the problem is there are very few junior ones, and the one that is do hire aren't always

00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:30,020
that great at supporting their junior developers.

00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:42,180
I have a friend who ended up quitting because she got so little support, they just didn't

00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,600
give her any training, they kind of metaphorically threw her into a swimming pool and told her

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,700
to learn how to swim.

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,900
So unsurprisingly she left that place and now is spending a bunch of money to getting

00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,920
a computer science masters because she didn't get the support that should have given it

00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
to her.

00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:09,150
So sadly No. 7, the potential for burnout starts early.

00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,260
So I've definitely experienced burn outmyself.

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,450
I guess it's a combination of working in a high-pressure startup environment, working

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,980
fast, always shipping and making sure that the company stayed together, it was kind of

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,530
inevitable and as someone who thrives on being hyperproductive all the time, I really hated

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,750
feeling that way and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:38,010
Quick recap: Burnout is defined by the WHO as feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion,

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,240
increased mental distance from one's job or feelings of negativism or sin nix related

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,720
to one's job, and reduced professional efficacy.

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,850
So James towards the end of his bootcamp was definitely walking on a tightrope but he definitely

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:59,490
came close and that was really sad for me to see and I guess that's not surprising.

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,350
Boot camps require something like 80-plus hours a week of study.

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,460
Plus the pressure if you failed the exam, you could leave with debt and no job to show

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:15,090
for it and if you're someone like James who didn't go to University and never sat for

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:23,830
exams, doing an exam and having to go into intensive study in order to not get kicked

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:32,650
out of boot that was intense.

00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,670
Thankfully he came through it, but plenty of people don't.

00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:40,810
Even once he gets a job, the prospects on that job weren't great.

00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:46,070
A 2018 survey asked close to 11.5 thousand tech employees if they felt burned out and

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,350
60% of them did.

00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,900
The best company on that list, Netflix, had 40%.

00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,730
So the pressure of this environment and keeping up with the fast-moving field of engineering

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,990
takes his toll.

00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,630
Which brings me to thing 8, resiliency is so important.

00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,950
James survived his boot camp brush with burnout.

00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:22,530
And now he has to make but the reality is pretty far from that and that can

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,820
be a pretty demoralizing wakeup call, but it's not just the job hunt that needs strength.

00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,720
Being an engineer means keeping up with this constant sea of changes and that can be pretty

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,480
exhausting and James got his first taste of this very early on.

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:46,730
He'd learned about object oriented programming and then React.

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,680
And then along came React 16.8 and sorry, kids, now hooks is the thing, forget about

00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,990
classes, you don't need them anymore.

00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,930
So before he'd even graduated, the thing that he'd learned was the right way of doing things

00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:04,530
was no longer the right way of doing things, which kind of sucks, coding is really this

00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,700
career-long marathon and boy had you better be ready to change your route, running shoes

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,750
and technique continually for the rest of your race and the rest of your career.

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:20,980
So OK, that all sounds kind of doom and gloom, but I guess thing No. 9 was the thing that

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,911
surprised me the most and that's helping someone learn to code is really great with helping

00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,810
with Imposter Syndrome.

00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:33,540
Now because of that constant struggle to keep up with what was going on in our industry

00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:45,610
or perhaps because I'm self-taught or because I'm a naturally anxious person.

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:52,930
In fact when I first suggested to James that I help him to code I was secretly terrified.

00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,750
What if this exposed me as not knowing anything?

00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,690
So a quick refresher on Imposter Syndrome.

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,960
David did a great talk on this yesterday so if you didn't see that, I would definitely

00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,800
recommend watching it on YouTube.

00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:12,360
So good job, David, but Imposter Syndrome is referred to as a psychological pattern

00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,590
in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,980
being exposed as a fraud.

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,820
I constantly feel like someday I'm going to be handed a challenge that I can't solve and

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,770
I'll be exposed as this fraud that I think I am.

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:33,750
In spite of the fact that 10 years professionally and many years as a hobby that's not actually

00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,220
happened.

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,490
Throughout my career I've definitely downplayed my achievements.

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:43,360
For fear if I was going to say I'm really good at this, someone would say, prove it.

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,740
And I know it sounds ridiculous but it's kind of a pattern that I've been in for a while

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,460
and I know I'm not alone in that.

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,550
So I knew if I was going to be any use to James at all I was going to have to confront

00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:01,640
some demons about what I did know and what I didn't.

00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,820
So that was pretty scary.

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:10,400
When teaching myself code I felt I had to move past some basics to prove that I was

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,570
employable and productive and basically to get hired.

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:20,120
So being a pretty methodical person I decided to make a list of all the things that I knew

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:28,020
or thought I knew or felt I needed to know a bit more about.

00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:36,130
If I came across something that I wanted to dive in on more, I did.

00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,820
It turns out, for the most part, I knew way more than I thought I did.

00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,530
As I went through my list studying things and figuring out what I was maybe a bit fuzzy

00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:50,010
on and checking things off that I actually found out I was good at, I started to feel

00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,010
better.

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:57,730
Some of that gnawing feeling started to subside and it occurred to me that I maybe wasn't

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,600
entirely a fraud.

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,350
Being at a startup I kind of had to prioritize shipping things rather than learning things

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,480
that weren't definitely related to my job.

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,180
So that was a bonus, too.

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:19,120
OK, so thing No. 10 is a bit obvious, everyone knows that the even the romance knew that

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:27,740
back in their day, but I guess it never occurred to me quite how impactful it could be.

00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:33,890
Another factor is that more than not I'd learned things through reading things on the internet

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,680
and basically trying things and breaking things and trying them and breaking them again until

00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,030
they eventually worked.

00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:45,980
I never had to explain to anyone in real life what I was doing, I never had to talk through

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,590
a function that I'd written and saying what it did or saying why things didn't work or

00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,860
exactly what was going on line by line.

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,880
But I think doing that really helped me with things like technical communication and explaining

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,410
those things really helped me in ways that hadn't really happened before.

00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:07,450
And one of the cool things that happened is while James was at boot camp he started teaching

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,450
other people.

00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:18,760
He'd got handle on something and he told me he would run little impromptu teaching sessions.

00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,900
So that was really awesome.

00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:28,310
OK, I'm getting toward the rest of my talk and I wish I could say that James is living

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:33,430
his dream but the fact is that he's still applying to those 50 jobs a week.

00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,560
He's had interviews and code challenges but the reality is despite his talents, there

00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,210
is a numbers game and it's going to take a while.

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:46,240
Now for me as a hiring manager I will admit in the past I've been frustrated by the huge

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,900
numbers of new grads applying to mid level jobs that I've posted one the where we specified

00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,420
three to four years experience but I need to remember that each of these applications

00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,740
is a human and they've gone through a struggle to get there.

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:06,320
They have to do this in this numbers game that eventually a company will bite.

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,050
We as hiring managers we need to hire these folks.

00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:20,880
In fact you'll often reduce the velocity of a team at first, but as a saying that a team

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,710
of senior developers and no junior developers is just a team of developers.

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,930
It's so true.

00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:33,530
Hiring junior engineers who are excited and super dedicated to learn will elevate your

00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,910
team in so many ways.

00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,870
But to make sure that you have a real training program in place, because they deserve that.

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:45,710
Don't hire them just to do the stuff that you aren't interested in or too bored to do.

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,200
So to sum up.

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:55,010
I didn't think that this was going to be anything but beneficial to him, but it turns out that

00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:00,280
it helped me face uncomfortable demons and I think made me a better engineer for it.

00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:08,680
So whether you've just started to code or whether you've a senior, grizzled, engineer

00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,260
like me, try teaching someone.

00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,780
You might be surprised by what you learn.

00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,780
Thank you.

00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,040
