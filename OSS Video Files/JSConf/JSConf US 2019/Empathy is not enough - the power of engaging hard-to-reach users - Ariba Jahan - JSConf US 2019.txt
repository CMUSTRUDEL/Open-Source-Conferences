Title: Empathy is not enough - the power of engaging hard-to-reach users - Ariba Jahan - JSConf US 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-12
Playlist: JSConf US 2019
Description: 
	As technologists, one of the hardest things to remember is that we’re not our users and our assumptions can easily extend into our work. If we aren’t careful, we can easily end up designing products based on our assumptions and biases rather than insights from the actual audience.

If we want to build better products, we need to include our target audience in the creation process and listen to their feedback every step of the way. In this talk, I’ll share what my team and I learned from two different projects where we worked directly with our audiences - busy moms who were raising a child with autism and Gen-Zs experiencing various forms of bullying. You’ll learn what types of biases to watch out for, how to challenge your own assumptions, how to engage hard-to-reach audiences, and how the user-driven insights we gained uncovered the struggles unique to their community and informed our design decisions and product iterations. Whether or not you work in UX design, this talk will help you create tech solutions that are physically, cognitively and emotionally accessible and ultimately valuable for all humans.

Empathy is not enough  the power of engaging hard to reach users

00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:09,860
Ariba Jahan PARISS: Hey, everyone.

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,860
Again.

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,961
This is our final talk of the evening.

00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:12,961
So, this next speaker coming up, she climbed mountain Kilimanjaro, isn't that crazy, okay.

00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:13,961
So, this is who is not in the room: Building better products by engaging hard to reach

00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:14,961
users.

00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:15,961
Let's give a warm welcome to Ariba Jahan.

00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:16,961
[ Applause ] ARIBA: Hi.

00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:17,961
Just so you know, you'll see me stepping on and stepping off a stool here.

00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:18,961
I'm 4 foot 11 inches so some adjustments needed to be made.

00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:21,920
So, I'm gonna give you a second to kind of read some of these headlines that showcase

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,050
what's been happening in our industry.

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,450
So, this  this is what we get when we don't challenge our assumptions.

00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,629
Hi, I'm Ariba Jahan.

00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:39,460
And today I'm here to share with you four ways you can challenge your assumptions to

00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,930
avoid headlines like those.

00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,730
And instead build better and more impactful products for your audience.

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,480
And the four methods  oh, okay.

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:58,370
And the four methods I'll share with you are helping us think through product development

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,670
in a new way at the ad council.

00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,080
And I'm hoping they'll be helpful for you as you bring these back to your work.

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:13,320
So, for context, the Ad Council, we're a nonprofit organization that leverages the power of communication

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,990
to tackle the nation's biggest challenges like preventing wildfires and LGBTQ rights

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,750
awareness and diversity and inclusion and promoting girls in STEM.

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,890
We bring together industry leaders to develop campaigns to create social impact and create

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,550
action.

00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,890
And as the director of innovation at the Ad Council, my responsibility is to facilitate

00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,970
innovative thinking and work in our teams as well as cultivate a culture where experimentation

00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,080
and curiosity can thrive.

00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,591
And I get to do that in many ways including training our whole staff on Splash Box, which

00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:58,470
is our approach to innovation.

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:05,560
And it incorporates methodologies from LEAN as well as human centered design with mindsets

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,860
to cultivate in our teams.

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,209
And to date we've trained 80% of the organization, giving us a shared proposal and toolset to

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,209
innovate.

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:25,510
And as a way to bring the training  the skills people learn at the training to life and make

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:31,840
them more tangible, we created a project where our new innovators can apply their skills

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,420
to create a digital prototype for one of our campaign issues.

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,209
So, today I'm really excited to share with you one of these digital prototype projects

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,700
where our assumptions got in the way and we had to use these  the four methods I mentioned

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,230
to uncover our assumptions and to really challenge them.

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,879
So, the campaign issue we chose was teen bullying prevention.

00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,250
And the task at hand was, well, how do we leverage the power of technology, what it

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,879
is today, to answer this big question?

00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,280
How might we influence teens to reduce peer mistreatment and empower one another by building

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,870
and perpetuating a more empathetic, supportive and inclusive culture?

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,430
Our target audience for this project were teens ranging from the ages 13 to 17 years

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,249
old who fell into the category of "Good eggs."

00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:35,329
We defined" Good eggs 'as teens who believe they're good people and value kindness and

00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,599
respect of one another and they want to be the best version of themselves.

00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:48,620
So, as you can imagine, we were really excited to contribute towards creating a more inclusive

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,299
world for our next generations.

00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:55,680
So, as any good team, we dug in n and did a tremendous amount of research.

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,379
From reading every single research report we could get our hands on about Gen Z, and

00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,879
interviewing teens, teachers, as well as issue experts.

00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,590
And our research gave us so many insightful findings, that we were able to come up with

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,949
over a hundred ideas and 20 concepts.

00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:24,050
And we then showed our strongest ideas to team to get some early feedback on which ideas

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,170
do we refine, how do we refine them?

00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,639
And which ideas should we be leaving behind?

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,220
After this many rounds of research and getting early user feedback directly from teens, we

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,759
felt pretty confident in our direction.

00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,330
And we knew that whatever solution we create in order to solve for bullying has to solve

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,000
the three goals.

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,280
Our research told us that good eggs have an innate desire to create the change they wanted

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,860
to see in the world.

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:07,180
We wanted to show them that and their actions, hoping they will adopt the kinder behaviors.

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,900
And two, we should double down on social media.

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,770
We found out that 91% of Gen Z are on social media.

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,180
So, we knew immediately that we needed to prioritize and emphasize the role of social

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,110
media in our digital solution.

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,259
And three, leverage the rise of CGI influencers.

00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:36,680
See, at the time, four computer generated based influencers are garnered over 1 million

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,830
followers on Instagram.

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,780
And we were kind of blown away by those and we need to do something with this.

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:49,990
Whether it's to do storytelling or to model good behaviors to teens in hopes that it works

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,699
for them.

00:05:51,699 --> 00:06:01,080
So, keeping these three goals in mind, we refined our 20 concepts into five promising

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,349
ideas.

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:07,470
And then we took these ideas to teams to get some more validation and then start building

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,230
them.

00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:16,639
And the main thing we learned at this round with teens is that we were wrong on all fronts.

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,710
What we focused on as goals were actually just assumptions.

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,900
Starting with the word bullying.

00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,810
It turns out that the only people that use the word bullying is a bunch of adults who

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,469
want to end bullying.

00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:32,849
[ Laughter ] And, you know, we learned that because we

00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:39,229
talked to teens and when we asked them, hey, can you share your experience with bullying?

00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,370
They didn't have much to share.

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:48,020
But when we changed our wording and asked, can you share the last time someone hurt you?

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,219
Or maybe when you've hurt someone else?

00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:56,030
They shared stories about being excluded, shaming, blaming.

00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,270
And there was just so much more vulnerability involved.

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:05,490
So, it turned out that their language around mistreatment looked very different than ours.

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,169
And they're actually way more self aware than we give them credit for.

00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:16,040
We asked them, can you think about a moment where you mistreated someone or you hurt someone.

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:23,270
And when they did that, they used words like regret, guilt, is upset as how they felt afterwards.

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,400
So, they're clearly fully aware of the implications of their actions.

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,419
And it turned out that even though 91% of Gen Z are on social, they value privacy and

00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,669
authenticity way more than what we knew.

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:43,860
To the point where they have two types of Instagram accounts.

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,349
One is called Finsta which is fake Instagram account.

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:51,659
And that is where they are their most authentic self.

00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:55,490
Photos are unfiltered, they keep it private.

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:01,050
No crafted captions and they keep the number of people who can follow that account very

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,050
small.

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,360
And then they have the Rinsta, the real Instagram account where it's hyper curated, well crafted

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,479
captions.

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:17,659
Perhaps even song lyrics and that's where they want to have a lot of followers.

00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:23,240
And when it came down to CGI influencers, only like a few teens knew what a CGI influencer

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
was.

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,379
And even the ones that followed them only did it out of curiosity for the character's

00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,439
fashion.

00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,159
And if you  I'm not so sure if you can read it, but if you can look at their handwritten

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:41,409
feedback on the screen, you'll notice what they wanted instead was someone relatable.

00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,899
Someone who might have had a tough childhood.

00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,050
Someone who has gone through issues.

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,770
And they also wanted someone funny.

00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,769
I really think just wanted Kevin Hart.

00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:58,480
[ Laughter ] So, our assumptions were checked.

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,120
You know?

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,300
And before I dive into the four tactics that allowed us to uncover these assumptions, I

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,430
want to talk about assumptions for a second.

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:17,650
You know, assumptions  assumption is something we believe to be true without any evidence.

00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:26,160
And the reason it's so easy for our assumptions and biases to come into our work or to creep

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,060
up even after tremendous amount of research, is because our brain is constantly making

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,560
assumptions just in the interest of efficiency.

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:43,260
See, the thing is, over the course of 200,000 years, our brain has created several mental

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,889
shortcuts to help us cope and survive and deal with the tremendous amounts of innovation

00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,589
in our world.

00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:58,230
So, we end up having shortcuts that help us make sense of large amounts of information.

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,260
Shortcuts that help us determine what's important to remember and what to recall.

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,589
Shortcuts that create explanations for us when we don't have enough meaning or when

00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,790
there is not enough context.

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,660
And shortcuts that help us act quickly.

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,050
These ready shorts that help us remember how to ride a bike, know 2 plus 2, help us detect

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:25,660
joy or frustration in someone's voice and to run from perceived danger.

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:31,930
While all of those sound necessary, these are the same shortcuts that cause us to make

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:38,000
assumptions, make snap judgments, jump to conclusions and make decisions based on our

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,300
biases.

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,589
And these mental shortcuts are more commonly known as cognitive biases.

00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:52,410
And the thing is, with 180 of these mental shortcuts active in our brain all the time,

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:58,090
it's kind of hard to spot when they're getting in the way or when they're active.

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:03,660
So, I'll call out three that got in our way and we didn't even notice it.

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:10,019
See, we have a mental shortcut that causes us to be easily influenced by what is stored

00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,330
in our memory or what's familiar.

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,829
And that's the way  that's the reason why all of us use the word bullying to describe

00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:19,840
that interaction.

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,350
Even without even questioning does that language even resonate?

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,209
Does it even work?

00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:32,170
We have another mental shortcut that causes us to make judgments and impressions by relying

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,690
only on the information made available to us.

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:42,380
And that's why when we see data like 91% of teens are on social media and they spend 9

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,940
hours consuming media, we're just like, oh my god.

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,660
They must be sharing everything and they're on it all the time.

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,690
Let's just like do everything social media related.

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,199
What we don't do is actively question, well, does this 91% do the same exact thing?

00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:00,130
Did they all use the same features in the same exact way?

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,139
Do they all feel the same way?

00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:05,410
We don't do that.

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:11,630
And the last mental shortcut I'll call out is that we're just naturally drawn to details

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,670
that confirm our own existing beliefs.

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,990
It's just what we do.

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,990
This is why we have friends.

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,509
This is how we make friends.

00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:20,720
I'll look for someone who likes the same thing as I do.

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,420
Now we're friends.

00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,940
And the thing is, that same bias is what causes us to find things that validate us.

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,750
So, when we were super hyped up about CGI influencers, we ended up paying a lot more

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,910
closer attention to headlines like these that said, oh, my god, CGI influencers are the

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,670
future of the influencer marketing.

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,459
And that's what happens.

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:49,199
So, while great for survival, mental shortcuts are not great for innovation.

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:54,019
And that's how easy it is for mental shortcuts that are designed to help us cope to get in

00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:57,210
the way of us making products that are right for our audience.

00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,779
So, for the rest of my talk, I will focus on how we used  is it jumping on the screen?

00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,779
Because it's jumping here.

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:02,779
So, I just wanted to double check.

00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:03,779
It's jumping?

00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:04,779
Okay.

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:05,779
I'm gonna assume someone's gonna take care of that.

00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:06,779
[ Laughter ] But I'll keep going.

00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:07,779
So, yes.

00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:08,779
I'll focus on how we used these four methods in the teen bullying prevention prototype

00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:09,779
projects.

00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,449
And I hope it gives you inspiration on how you can take some of these methods back into

00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:17,110
your projects so you can challenge your assumption.

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,519
Okay.

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,240
So, the first one being mapping  oh!

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Mapping assumptions.

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,713
I'll just read for a second so you can have the slides while I talk.

00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:26,713
All right.

00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:27,713
We're up.

00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:28,713
So, the first one I'll talk about is mapping assumptions.

00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:29,713
It's an activity where we actively  what slide is that?

00:13:29,713 --> 00:13:30,713
Oh, that's not moving.

00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:31,713
All right.

00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:32,713
Now we're there.

00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:33,713
So, it's an activity where we actively uncover critical uncertainties, unknowns and blind

00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:36,959
spots about our audience, challenge and solutions we're thinking about exploring.

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,709
And the thing about assumptions, as we saw, is that they don't always look and feel like

00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:42,709
assumptions.

00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:43,709
They feel like facts.

00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:49,800
So, it's really good to have a diverse team in the room so that we can all help each other

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,649
spot each other's blind spots and challenge each other's assumptions.

00:13:53,649 --> 00:14:00,649
So, for our project, in order to map assumptions, we started by asking ourselves questions around

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,000
teens' experiences with mistreatment.

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,690
So, we tried to figure out like how much do we know the audience?

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,399
What type of language do they use?

00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,750
What's their lifestyle?

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,750
What brings them joy?

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,710
What are their priority, pain points?

00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,790
And how do they use technology?

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:22,769
And then we asked ourselves, well, what do we believe to be true about teen mistreatment?

00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:27,269
How does mistreatment show up in their lives and how do they solve it?

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:31,580
And is this a challenge they need solved by us?

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,220
And just in general, what else do they know that we should know about and whose voices

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,660
have been heard?

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,459
When we did this, we had more questions than answers.

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,790
And despite all the research we did, we didn't know much about teens.

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:52,000
So, we took all of our assumptions and needed to figure out, where do we go from here?

00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,779
So, to prioritize what we needed to dig into, we mapped on a 2x2 grid.

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:06,240
From known to unknown, and the Y axis was very important to not very important.

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,420
It and helped us tease out the critical uncertainties that we needed to figure out before going

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,860
any further.

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:21,450
To recap, mapping assumptions can really help us uncover our blind spots, what we believe

00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,300
to be true versus what is actually true.

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,769
And critical gaps in the team's overall knowledge.

00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:32,339
And answering these questions about the audience and the challenge we're solving for is a great

00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,959
way to know where to go next, what to explore before going any further or investing any

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,750
further in the project.

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:47,139
So, after rounds of interviewing with teens and doing brainstorms within our teams, we

00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:50,940
had about 20 fleshed out concepts and we loved them all.

00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,069
But we had no clue which idea would work.

00:15:54,069 --> 00:16:00,259
And instead of just choosing an idea, just praying something works, we decided to test

00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,920
five of our strongest concepts.

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:09,241
So, we ran several experiments to explore Whether or not our ideas could create the

00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:15,410
desired outcome we were hoping for and to garner any new knowledge.

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:22,029
And while mapping assumptions is a great place to start, testing hypothesis kind of allows

00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:26,630
you to uncover all the invisible assumptions that we didn't even notice yet.

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,440
So, to test multiple hypothesis, we do two things.

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,370
We created hypothesis statements to get really specific on what we were hope our ideas can

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,370
do.

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,130
And then that helped us hone in on what are we hoping to uncover through test something

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:49,660
and then we identified our riskiest assumptions which were, what are the beliefs we're holding

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,870
about our ideas that if disproven completely break ours idea altogether?

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:04,410
So, in order to create these hypothesis statements, we reframed each of our ideas into a hypothesis

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,620
by using a Madeline framework like this.

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,110
You fill in the parentheses with the relevant information in your project.

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:19,209
So, we believe this audience has a problem doing this.

00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,039
We believe this solution can help.

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,180
They will do this engagement resulting in the desired outcome.

00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:35,120
So, going back to our CGI project, this is an example, our assumptions and our hypothesis

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,450
is, we believe that teens have a problem noticing the impact of their actions which leads them

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,880
to mistreat each other.

00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,809
We believe that a fictional CGI character whose life captures the dramatic realities

00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:56,289
of the teen experience, including teachable moments where the character models kindness,

00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,950
can help.

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:04,010
And we believe that teens will follow and relate to the character causing them to reflect

00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,780
and adopt the modeled positive behaviors in real life.

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,820
So, it really gets the team to focus on, what are we doing here?

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,909
What are we hoping to do?

00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:18,200
Versus getting tied up in the features and the color and the UI of the product.

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,110
So, we did that for all five ideas.

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,870
And then we needed to identify our riskiest assumption.

00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:33,929
We did that by first asking, well, what must be true in order for this idea to work?

00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,600
Like at all?

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,770
And what must be true in order for this idea to add value to the teens' lives?

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,400
And then when we answered these questions, we looked through them and tried to identify

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,210
the ones that, if disproven, completely breaks our idea.

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,970
So, going back to our CGI project, we came up with a lot of things that we're assuming

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,520
and hoping to be true in order for this idea to work.

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,570
And what really stood out to us as our riskiest assumption was our belief that teens will

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,640
resonate with the CGI character.

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:16,750
See, if teens don't relate or follow the CGI person, like this whole idea is irrelevant

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,700
and we're not going to do anything.

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,010
But what's great about testing is that we can know that without ever spending any time

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:30,840
investing in, developing and putting the CGI character together.

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,510
So, by the time we did this for each one of our ideas, we ended up with like a list of

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,830
elements and interactions that we were assuming teens would love and engage with.

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,270
But had no proof.

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,000
So, all of the  all of them needed to be tested.

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,900
Like does anonymity really matter?

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:58,690
Do teens care about interacting with things in real time and user generated content?

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:05,320
And do they really value influencer oriented things?

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,210
And then we took those and we wanted to test them without having to build anything.

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:16,120
So, we used simple things like surveys and design prototypes to test all of those features

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,240
to figure out, like, where are we going?

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:27,159
So, to recap, the simple act of reframing an idea into a hypothesis is such a great

00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,710
reminder that regardless of how exciting our ideas may sound, we don't really know yet

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,179
if any of them will work.

00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:40,559
So, they need to be tested in order for us to move forward.

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:48,090
And to help prioritize what to even test first, we really hone in on the beliefs we're holding

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:55,020
on to about our ideas that if invalidated our idea needs to be scrapped.

00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:00,890
And the thing is, being able to test our ideas before building anything is actually gave

00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,390
us a lot of freedom from creativity.

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,671
It gave us the liberty to dream just a little bigger knowing that our audience would let

00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:12,270
us know what to refine and what to leave behind.

00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,419
So, let's go big.

00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:21,470
So, testing multiple ideas with our users was super insightful.

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,210
But there's a limitation to how much we could learn through testing.

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,820
Because the thing is, when we have prototypes that we're showing and asking questions to

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,809
teens, they're only reacting to whatever we're giving them.

00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:41,340
And that's why engaging and working with and empowering our users to create their own solutions

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,460
was so critical to see.

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:52,780
We coordinated with a high school in New York City and we  we hosted three co creation

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,299
sessions.

00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:59,770
And we really wanted to understand how do teens perceive bullying today?

00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,740
What types of digital interactions do they even enjoy?

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:10,190
And that list of riskiest elements that we were so excited about?

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,150
We wanted to invalidate or validate some of them.

00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,470
And lastly, we wanted to see how would teens solve this?

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:25,049
So, what you see up here is a snapshot of the solutions students came up with when we

00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:30,309
asked them to design a digital tool that could help people be more mind and inclusive of

00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,490
others.

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,330
And/or to help people avoid hurting someone's feelings.

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,990
We purposely didn't use words like teen or bullying because we didn't to want mislead

00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,799
them or drive them in a direction that's not natural for them.

00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,490
We then got our user feedback on these new ideas as well.

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:57,400
So, the co creation sessions validated some hypotheses while invalidating others.

00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:05,170
And what we learned from teens directly helped us design three new cocreated prototypes.

00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:09,970
And the thing about co creations is, you saw how insightful they were.

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:15,340
But they also uncovered ideas that we couldn't have come up with on our own.

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:21,419
For example, our students came up with this brilliant idea which they called In My Bag.

00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:27,870
In my bag is a phrase teens use to indicate when they are feeling emotionally unavailable

00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,150
or sad.

00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:35,450
So, this is an app that would allow users to air drop or somehow alert their friends

00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:42,200
when they are not feeling emotionally available and they want to be left alone.

00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,140
And you can see the handwritten feedback from other students on this idea.

00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:53,100
And their feedback on this idea was super enthusiastic and very validating.

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,680
They said thing like, it's fire.

00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,590
And you can tell people around you how you're actually feeling.

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,590
See?

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,429
Their comments showed us that they wanted to be vulnerable.

00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:07,260
And they wanted to share how they were feeling.

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,020
Which is contrary to the social pressure they have to be tough.

00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:21,120
So, the ability to uncover new learnings about our audience and hear ideas that we couldn't

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,860
have ever come up with on our own, is what makes co creation so powerful.

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:33,340
And by creating space for our users to join us in the process, we get out of our own way.

00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,350
So, it's been quite a journey.

00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,020
From identifying opportunities and researching for insights to coming up with over a hundred

00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:49,960
ideas to then testing those hypothesis with teens and then co designing some with them,

00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,850
there were moments when our ideas were invalidated and our assumptions were checked.

00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,770
and the thing is, that's what learning looks like.

00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:04,010
And also we made progress, it didn't come easily.

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:09,399
We went out of our way to find a diverse mix of teens to interview and worked with our

00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:13,940
local high school to organize these co creations.

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,029
And we needed parents to sign permission slips, we had to work around exam schedules, homework

00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:25,779
schedules, and we had to be totally okay if a teen suddenly flaked on a phone interview.

00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:26,779
But you know what?

00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:31,059
All of that  all of that relentless effort was worth it.

00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:35,409
Because the audience we were looking to serve was not in the room and their perspective

00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,990
was crucial.

00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:45,049
And to empower teams to be this relentless, to chase after these unknowns, we must create

00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:49,740
a culture where curiosity and innovation can thrive.

00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,090
And what does that look like?

00:25:53,090 --> 00:26:00,169
It's a team where there's less of a monoculture of thoughts and ideas but has people who seek

00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:04,010
perspectives unlike their own.

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,230
Where we spend less time defending ideas and spend more time testing our hypothesis with

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,590
a diverse representation of our audience.

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:17,950
We spent less time looking for that one right answer.

00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,720
And realized that we must create space for everyone to embrace the unknown and ambiguity

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,230
and just stay curious.

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:31,630
And instead of using language and reward systems in our workplace to heighten our sense of

00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:37,190
fear or failure, let's just create a culture that's open to being wrong.

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:46,399
So, rounding off, I want you to remember that our brain has many mental shortcuts that are

00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:50,610
really just constantly on and just trying to help us survive and hope and process the

00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,270
world around us.

00:26:52,270 --> 00:27:00,750
But those same shortcuts also make us do  make decisions based on our biases, make snap

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:09,419
judgments, and make assumptions and miss critical information that others wouldn't miss.

00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:16,179
So, while we'd all like to believe that we're not that biased or maybe we're not as biased

00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:22,140
as the other people, that thought in itself is a bias.

00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,570
It's called bias blind spot.

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:31,789
So, this bias blind spot can cause us to let our assumptions go unchecked and affecting

00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:35,050
our ability to make the right product for our audience.

00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:39,940
So, I want you to remember to do these four things.

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,309
Let's try to map our assumptions and unknowns about the challenge we're trying to tackle

00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,450
and the people that we're trying to solve for, and the solutions that we think that

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,669
would help them so we can uncover the gaps of knowledge in our teams and figure out,

00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,010
what do we have to really explore to move any forward?

00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:02,510
Let's test multiple ideas to see if they really create the outcome we were hoping for?

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,460
And a great place to start with that is really going after the beliefs that we're holding

00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:12,710
on to that if proven wrong can completely invalidate our idea.

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,830
And let's bring our audience more into our process by cocreating with them so that they

00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:24,320
can solve the things themselves and show us ideas that we can't come up with on our own.

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,330
And let's be relentless in making sure that the people that we're trying to serve, that

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:35,290
their voices are heard and that we have a diverse team in place to hear them and that

00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:39,690
we are making sure that we're aligned with our product, goals and ethics.

00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:49,330
And lastly, nurture a team that seeks perspectives unlike their own, values testing and can stay

00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,269
curious.

00:28:51,269 --> 00:29:00,149
So, instead of fighting the 180 mental shortcuts, evolution has ingrained in us, Let's use these

00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:05,850
four methods to uncover and challenge our assumptions so that we can make better and

00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,120
more impactful products for our audience.

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Thank you.

00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
[ Applause ] >> Thank you.

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
PARISS: How are you feel something KATIE: I'm pretty tired.

00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
I'm pretty tired.

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
I just did some yoga on stage in the other room.

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
That took a lot out of me.

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
But I'm feeling good.

00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
I had a good day can you have a good day?

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
PARISS: I had a really good day.

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
KATIE: Did y'all have a good day?

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
PATRICIA: Again, I want to thank the speakers.

00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
You did amazing.

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
I know you were all nervous.

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
You killed it.

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Great job.

00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
Round of applause.
