Description: 
	How can you include, welcome, provide support, safety and a confidence boost to people from underrepresented and marginalized groups that are absent from your community/workplace?

Deliberate, Directed, Positive ACTION!

This talk will chart the journey, and learnings, of Global Diversity CFP Day which has the sole aim of encouraging underrepresented and marginalized people to take to the conference stage.

Starting with half a dozen workshops in 2016 focussed on two conferences based in Edinburgh, Scotland, this has exploded into a 80+ workshop, tech wide, world wide movement on a single day each year!
