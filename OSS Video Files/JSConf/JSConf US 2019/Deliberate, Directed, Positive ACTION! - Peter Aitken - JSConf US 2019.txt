	How can you include, welcome, provide support, safety and a confidence boost to people from underrepresented and marginalized groups that are absent from your community/workplace?

Deliberate, Directed, Positive ACTION!

This talk will chart the journey, and learnings, of Global Diversity CFP Day which has the sole aim of encouraging underrepresented and marginalized people to take to the conference stage.

Starting with half a dozen workshops in 2016 focussed on two conferences based in Edinburgh, Scotland, this has exploded into a 80+ workshop, tech wide, world wide movement on a single day each year!

Deliberate, Directed, Positive ACTION!

00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,120
Peter Aitken PARISS: Cool.

00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,120
All right.

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,120
We're back.

00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
Have everyone's attention?

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,229
Me and Peter were back there doing the power pose because we're both nervous when we get

00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:08,229
up here so.

00:00:08,229 --> 00:00:09,239
Can we clap on Peter Aitken?

00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:10,350
[ Applause ] PETER: There we go.

00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,690
How are you all doing, JSConf?

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,830
My name's Peter Aitken.

00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,290
Today I'm going to be speaking about deliberate, direct positive action.

00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,290
During the day, oops.

00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,290
I'm a slide ahead.

00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,290
I think I'll just start again.

00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,570
So, during the day I work at litmus where we built something called email creative platform.

00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,520
My day job involves looking after a team.

00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,000
We build the app with JavaScript, Rails in an agile fashion.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,880
We all work remotely.

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,280
Currently we're hiring.

00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,100
If you would like to if this sounds interesting, please catch me later.

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,760
Previously I spent many years organizing Scotland CSS and Scotland JS.

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,579
And now I focus my community efforts on something called global diversity CFP day which is going

00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:57,489
to be the focus of our talk today.

00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:02,249
And what I learned throughputting this together.

00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:09,900
Just to give you an idea what that is, on a single day we host a load of workshops all

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,030
around the world with the sole aim of supporting and encouraging people from underrepresented

00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,330
and marginalized groups and putting together their first tech conference proposal.

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:29,230
The aim, thereby, being if more people from these groups apply, then you'll see more people

00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,220
with different coming from different backgrounds with different experiences and different perspectives

00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,960
and sharing that on stages like this.

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,430
So, to just I want to introduce some definitions here.

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:52,690
Because I get a whole lot of questions around two of the terms in the title of the event

00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,690
name.

00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,510
First up, diversity.

00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:04,660
What we're talking about here is something that is contextually dependent on your location

00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,210
in the world.

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:15,319
And excuse me it's usually easier to describe who diversity doesn't apply to.

00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:24,180
And so, in the western part of the world, the people that make up the majority of the

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:31,599
workforce, the privileged group, as I would describe them, are the cis white hetero men

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,439
like myself.

00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:42,209
And pretty much if all of those things, cis white, hetero, able bodied, man, if there's

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:49,060
any of those that don't apply to an individual, usually diversity refers to that individual.

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,749
Does that make sense?

00:02:51,749 --> 00:02:54,980
And there's another question that I get.

00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,969
Or variance of any time I'm involved in a diversity and inclusion initiative.

00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:10,069
And these questions usually come from someone who presents, like myself, and are along the

00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,160
lines of, can I participate in this event?

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:21,430
Because I think diversity applies to me because I work with this really, really obscure database

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,489
technology.

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,769
In case you're wondering, folks: No.

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,239
Next up, we've got the acronym CFP.

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,999
That stands for call for proposals.

00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:42,409
This is effectively a process that a tech conference like this would open to encourage

00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:49,709
the community to come forward to propose topics and share their knowledge and experience.

00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:55,329
So, who is this talk for?

00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:01,409
As I mentioned, this is a talk about the things that I've learned through organizing this

00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,409
event.

00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,189
And there's gonna be things that will be useful from a management perspective.

00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:10,439
If you are bringing a diversity and inclusion initiative, perhaps in the workplace.

00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:18,829
If you want to be a better member of the tech community, if you organize meetups, if you

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,310
organize conferences.

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:27,099
So, given that all of you are part of the JavaScript community, this talk is very much

00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,120
for you.

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:37,590
So, the rough order of service, I suppose, today, is we'll be talking through where did

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,199
CFP Day come from?

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,759
What happens during a workshop?

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,270
What's involved in organizing a workshop?

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,180
And through that there will be the sort of things that I have learned.

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,870
So, where did global diversity CFP Day come from?

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:59,680
It won't surprise you to discover that this grew out of my experience running conferences.

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:08,190
And I think from 2013 to 2015 when the call for proposals process was open for those conferences,

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,930
to encourage and engage people to apply to speak.

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,250
I would host a number of, like, video public video call sessions.

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,310
And it was kind of like meet the organizer and some previous speakers.

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,370
If you have any questions, you know, let's try and address them and encourage you to

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,410
apply to speak.

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:39,440
And by 2015, I had really no idea how many people from those calls were actually applying

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,270
or making the final lineup.

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,340
So, was this worthwhile?

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:53,460
And in 2015 at the after party, after giving our talk, Katie Fenn and I were chatting at

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,189
the after party.

00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:02,949
And Katie mentioned that the video calls that she attended was just the nudge that she needed

00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:06,629
to finally put together that first talk proposal.

00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:11,930
And if I remember correctly, Katie, kind of like myself, when it came to trying to

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:19,630
or to doing this kind of thing, procas somebody want to say it for me?

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,741
Procrastination was really getting in the way.

00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:28,550
So, if we fast forward to 2016.

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,800
Again, the CFP was open.

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:39,150
And I was trying to figure out a way of, you know, these video calls were useful.

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,470
But how could we amplify that?

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:46,949
How could we do something that was more direct, targeted, positive in terms of supporting

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,900
people from underrepresented and marginalized groups?

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,560
And that was a good question.

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,430
And how do we go about answering it?

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,860
Then three days later I just kind of sat up first thing in the morning and the idea just

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,720
had kind of came to me in any head.

00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,270
And that was the idea of hosting a diversity CFP workshop.

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:16,300
And that was specifically to encourage people to apply to Scotland JS and Scotland CSS.

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:26,110
So, this idea of having a workshop, you know, it was like, what was I doing?

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,650
I already, you know, I've got a full time job.

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,000
I've got family to look after.

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,919
And, you know, tend to and spend time with.

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,729
We've got we had two dogs that were running wild.

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:41,180
I was organizing two conferences.

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:49,229
Let痴 lets run a workshop here, yeah, in a couple of weeks' time.

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:52,919
And then I sort of started chatting to people.

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,590
For instance, Katie, who said, you know, as soon as I shared this idea Katie said, can

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,520
I run one in Sheffield?

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,770
I was chatting to a friend in Dublin, oh, we'll run one too.

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:13,240
And this kind of snowballed from having to effectively having a workshop in three

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:23,550
weeks' time in Glasgow in Scotland, Edinburgh, Sheffield, Dublin, London and Berlin.

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,860
I did literally get in touch with Robin from Berlin JS thinking, everybody was saying yes.

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,979
Just for a laugh, what do you think if we got this to happen in Berlin?

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,599
And Robin said, yes.

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,080
So, running those workshops I think it was about 60 people attended.

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:52,700
And it had a massive impact on the diversity of applicants to the conferences to speak.

00:08:52,700 --> 00:09:00,740
And in terms of the lineup, particularly for Scotland JS, it had a massive, massive impact.

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,889
In terms, 60 people attended these workshops.

00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:09,700
And there were 17 slots available for that conference.

00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,170
And three people from those workshops were speakers that year.

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,620
And bear in mind there was like 200 applicants to speak.

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,160
So, that was just it just validated the idea.

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:31,750
But in terms of putting these workshops together, I wanted everybody to have a the attendees

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,839
at each workshop to get a consistent message and set of advice.

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,260
And to try to make that happen, I wanted to sort of provide that message.

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,649
But at the same time, you know, because I didn't want six different groups of people

00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:52,399
trying to put together their own workshop on really short notice.

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,269
They're already running about looking for venues and mentors and team members and all

00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,269
this kind of stuff.

00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:05,139
And so, I thought, how can we sort of make this a whole lot simpler?

00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,620
How can we boil this down to like a conversation?

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,380
So, I was thinking, could we how could we make this happen?

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,560
And I got in touch with Raquel and Sarah Mei and asked, if there any chance that the two

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:29,230
of you could make some time to have a chat and share and discuss things like advice around

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,620
putting together a proposal?

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,740
What would you put in the title, in the abstract, the description fields?

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,370
And your experiences of that.

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,640
The highs and lows of being accepted, being rejected from events.

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,060
And on the flipside, you know, what's your experience with being in review committees.

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Knowing that they both had done that kind of thing.

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,480
Oh, and can you get it to us in the next fortnight, please?

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
Two weeks?

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,800
And they said yes.

00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,240
What's going on?

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,110
How can we put this burden on so many people and they just keep on saying yes?

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,721
And so, with those videos we were able to enable all of the workshops that were actual

00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:11,110
material to get going a whole lot quicker.

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,550
And so, enable people is the first thing to call out there.

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:21,709
So, the event was, let's see, right about the June time in 2016.

00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:30,240
And come about August time I had finally sort of my brain had reconstituted enough that

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:38,950
I'm sure the organizers say that's the same, running these types of events.

00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:50,730
And given the huge impact we mentioned earlier on Scotland JS, how could we well, it was

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,820
more like, there was nothing in the workshop, there was nothing that was JavaScript specific.

00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,769
There was nothing CSS specific.

00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:02,000
And there wasn't really anything even Scotland specific.

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,079
It kind of made me feel a little bit sad in that regard.

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,399
But let's turn the frown upside down.

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:17,350
You know, could this concept be shared with all tech communities and support all of the

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,690
people within those communities?

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,920
Could this be shared with all tech communities everywhere?

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,410
Which I still struggle with.

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,410
Just seems huge.

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,639
How does this all come to be?

00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:39,190
So, next up, what happens during a workshop?

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:48,700
If you come along to attend a workshop, there's a whole host of people that have are keen

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,670
to egg you on and make this happen for you.

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,300
I've already mentioned Raquel and Sarah giving you CFP advice.

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:03,370
Danielle, will help you in crafting your biography.

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:09,199
Saran will help you put together your perfect tech talk.

00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:14,019
Melinda will introduce you to slide design.

00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:18,420
And Jess will take you through a whole host of things that are gonna happen on the day

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,110
of your talk and how to handle them.

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,580
Some tips and thing like that.

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:32,171
And the mentors in the workshop will be working with you to help identify what exactly it

00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:35,509
is that you should be proposing a talk about.

00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:42,480
And, you know, later on there'll be the opportunity to actually start writing that proposal.

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,500
And ideally we'll all have prizes if you get that applied to an actual event by the end

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
of the day.

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,360
Which may be a bit of a challenge and a stretch.

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Okay.

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,889
And so, did anybody see Ariba's talk on Monday?

00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:05,350
[ Applause ] Woohoo!

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:13,279
Ariba was talking about bullying teenagers being bullied and the assumptions that her

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,760
team had made around trying to support the teenagers.

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:25,610
And through talking to the teenagers, they were able to sort of disprove some of those

00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,450
assumptions and get a whole lot of better ideas.

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:34,019
So, this totally ties up with my experience at this point.

00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,949
And to talk to people, you don't have all the answers.

00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:40,810
And in this situation, in this example where is it?

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,300
There we go.

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,470
Danielle on the top right there is the CEO of walk talk design.

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:52,790
They host a whole series of workshops related to encouraging women to be speaking and trying

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,200
to elevate and promote them.

00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,700
So, we have very, very similar goals.

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,820
We were having a chat and Danielle was rapid fire going through all these things that they

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,149
have basically in their back pocket.

00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:10,050
And to try to see where the holes were in the CFP Day curriculum.

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,100
Whether there was anything that we could add.

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:22,630
And when it comes to applying to speak, there's two things that you'll need to put together.

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,990
One being your proposal and the other one being your biography.

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:32,870
And, here I had completely forgotten about the biography.

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:39,339
That's why Danielle stepped in and put that workshop activity together.

00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,360
Yeah.

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,910
So, given what you've heard about these workshops, if this is something you feel might be of

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,620
interest, you might want to dip your toe into the water, there's no commitment necessary.

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,360
We will be running CFP Day in January 2020.

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:06,410
And we have advice from Ramon from his talk as well, just go for it.

00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,410
Next up.

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,819
What's involved in organizing a workshop?

00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:17,610
So, the first thing that you need to do before you dive in that this event worldwide is 100%

00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,730
free of charge.

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:26,510
We want to ensure that no attendee has to go through any sort of financial barrier that

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,610
may stop them from participating.

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,529
These are exactly the type of people we're hoping to support.

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:41,029
And also, you know, nobody gains financially in terms of the workshop organizers, the team

00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:43,889
members, myself.

00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:46,560
Nobody financially gains from this event.

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:54,279
So, what are the actual things that you need to do to be in terms of being an organizer?

00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,970
And this is the sort of list of things that you need to do from a sort of logistical perspective.

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,329
You need to find a venue.

00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:06,110
In terms of finding someone to pay for catering, that's kind of optional.

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,010
But it's really nice if you can take care of that and make that happen.

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:16,750
Because, you know, it's gonna keep everybody together in terms of the lunch and that sort

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,750
of thing.

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,850
And next up, you need to build an awesome team who share our values and mission.

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,150
You need to promote your workshop.

00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:31,920
You're gonna know your location a whole lot better than me back in Scotland.

00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,110
You're gonna know who all the different tech communities are.

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,670
You're gonna know the best people to reach out to, you're gonna know the best way to

00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:46,059
get in touch with the communities, Slack, meetup.com, whatever it may be.

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:53,020
And finally, code of conduct training.

00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,790
Everybody in your workshop team needs to go through this code of conduct training.

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,890
Attendees will potentially be bringing you issues to deal with.

00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,110
And it's to you to handle those situations.

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:14,130
The idea of training is that you're in the best position possible to handle any eventuality.

00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:21,150
And I suppose explain to you how we expect you to handle that situation.

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,970
So, at this point we've got a number of lessons learned.

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,970
All lined up.

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,190
First one, don't be shy.

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:36,570
And this is all around finding your venue and asking folks to pay for catering.

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:42,390
You know, it's like, reach out to companies to borrow their office at the weekend.

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:50,059
And excuse me ideally, everybody, you know, if we look back at the original first

00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:53,970
six workshops, everybody kept saying yes.

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,290
So, please, bear that in mind.

00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:03,610
And, you know, sort of use that as encouragement to reach out if you're looking for sponsorship

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,730
or space.

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:12,440
Another thing to bear in mind is that when you're reaching out to these companies, there's

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,640
more than likely somebody in there who has like a line item and their list of value goes.

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,860
And it has empty check box, and it will say something like, support diversity and inclusion.

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:31,210
And it maybe possibly will have a check mark after it.

00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,210
Reach out to them.

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,960
Think of it like this.

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,440
But maybe not put it in these terms.

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:44,220
That, you know, you're helping them by taking up their office space as a venue.

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,010
By accepting funding for catering.

00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,390
You're enabling them to tick that box when it comes to the end of the year for those

00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,870
in review.

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,120
You're helping them.

00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,990
Bear that in mind.

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:07,480
Ideally, I'm hoping that will encourage you to take these steps forward.

00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,110
Next up, we've got visibility.

00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:18,210
So, this, again, is very much in relation to your venue.

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:25,020
Once you've found a venue and you're going add all the details to the website, there's

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,750
quite a few questions and the access information section.

00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,130
There's about 35 questions in there.

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:40,260
And covering things like, does your venue support  or have gender neutral bathrooms?

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,690
Does it have a nursing room?

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,779
Is there a quiet room?

00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,659
Is there parking nearby?

00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:47,990
Is it well lit?

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,400
There's quite a lot.

00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,240
So, I'll hold off just there.

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,600
But the idea is that we're sharing the information about what your venue has available.

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,820
Ideally, if it's in an office, it's gonna be quite accessible.

00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,950
I doubt that it's gonna support all the things that we've got questions about.

00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:14,980
But the whole purpose here is to convey to the potential attendees what is available

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:22,880
and supported so that they can look at this and decide, does this venue support my access

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
requirements.

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,059
If it doesn't, ideally then we'll reach out.

00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:31,630
And hopefully the organizer will be able to do something to remedy that.

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,309
Which might not be possible.

00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:40,510
But they can bear it in mind for doing something better that would support people with that

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,650
particular requirement in an upcoming year.

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:51,480
I would like to give a huge shoutout to Aisha Blake who looks after our Detroit workshop

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:59,299
and has started a whole community around supporting newbies and public speaking all year round.

00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:07,640
And from here, the events that she has been previously involved in organizing has a list

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,400
of access questions.

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,800
About 20 questions.

00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,600
And passed them over and that was a huge start for getting us going.

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,010
And we're continually adding to them and be we're continually refining the language to

00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,390
make it as inclusive as possible.

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,500
Thank you, Aisha.

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,240
Next up, representation matters.

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:36,240
So, this feels like something that shouldn't need called out to organizers.

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,460
Because really this is what the whole event is about.

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:46,419
We want to have more people from different background on the tech stage.

00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:53,640
And ideally, you know, when people from similar backgrounds who generally up to that point

00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:01,640
haven't participated in events like this, when they see people like themselves on the

00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:08,419
speaking lineup, if they're comfortable enough, hopefully they will step forward and start

00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:13,020
to participate in these communities.

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,029
As an organizer when putting together your workshop team, please remember, representation

00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:22,510
matters in your team.

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:31,290
There have been cases where there's a group of men, very well intended, making workshops

00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,290
happen.

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,010
Which is great.

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:41,390
However, there are have been women that have got in touch and said, I'm not gonna

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,390
participate.

00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:49,860
If anybody is unsure as to why that might be, catch me later for a chat, okay?

00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,340
Next up, promote autonomy.

00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:58,640
So, earlier we were talking about enabling workshop organizers by providing as much materials

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,360
and a schedule to get everybody going.

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:08,830
When you're putting together your workshop team, you will be pulling in people that are

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,470
that have public speaking experience.

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,899
You will be pulling in people that have gone through these CFP processes and been accepted

00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:15,899
and rejected.

00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:20,179
And they will have a whole lot of advice and experience to share around that.

00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:28,860
If they have time and availability, could they put together a talk or a workshop activity?

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:37,529
If they have the time to do that and give the attendees in your workshop something that's

00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:43,130
even more engaging and memorable as an experience and like an educational experience.

00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:48,080
You are fully empowered to do that.

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:55,010
In terms of the materials we supply, you can use as much, all, as little or none as you

00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,049
see fit.

00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:02,000
As long as we're all driving towards the same goal.

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,250
If we've piqued your interest and this is something that you would like to participate

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:11,340
in, would you like to organize an event if there isn't one in your area?

00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:18,039
We will be opening the call for workshop areas and teams between September/October time.

00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:20,210
We would love to have you.

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:25,430
If there are any questions, grab me after this.

00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:31,669
And if there isn't, if there is already a workshop organizing being organized

00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:35,570
the team's details will be on that workshop page.

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,451
You will be able to get in touch with them and reach out and offer to join in.

00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:55,120
And everything has always been very welcome and keen to just bring everybody in.

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,340
Code of conduct.

00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,630
Let's see.

00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:05,200
Today this section I'm gonna talk about a very specific aspect around the CFP Day

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,490
code of conduct.

00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:12,970
So, in 2018, this is what the page or a section of the page looked like.

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:19,460
And at the bottom you see we have the code of conduct team which is myself and Kim.

00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:26,309
And I suppose the TL;DR, for the purples of this section that you need to be aware of

00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:30,130
in terms of the code of conduct, is that if there's an tissue that happens within the

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,330
workshop, ideally the team will be remedying that within the workshop.

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,240
With one exception.

00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,990
And that's if there's an issue reported with the organizer.

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:47,590
In that instance, the reporter should be where is it going?

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,230
See that lovely big orange button there?

00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:56,390
If the person wanting to report the issue presses that button and sends an email to

00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:04,680
the team, we then handle that and address the issue with the organizer.

00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,570
And so, there was something I should explain a little bit first.

00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:15,840
So, there was no incidents of this kind during the event.

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:28,409
However, in the latter half of 2018, we received a number of complaints about a small handful

00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:30,649
of organizers.

00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:35,230
And I'm not really gonna go into that too much.

00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,780
But it's more about how the people got in touch.

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,710
So, we put this shared inbox together.

00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:49,200
And nobody used it.

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:56,490
Everybody got in touch privately through Kim's DMs.

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:05,159
Which suggested to me that everybody either had some sort of affinity with Kim or trusted

00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,299
her.

00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:14,299
And in that situation, it was that they trusted Kim and didn't trust me.

00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:19,230
Or just that they trusted her more than they trusted me.

00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,190
I don't know.

00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,840
And in 2018, we were very much trying to make the team bigger.

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,520
And more representative.

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,450
But that didn't quite work out as we'd hoped.

00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:38,230
Because we're keeping on asking people to do more and more things and adding to people's

00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,230
workload.

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,630
So, by 2019, we had more people involved and engaged.

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:51,120
That picture down at the bottom is right off the bottom of everybody's screen when they

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,960
come to visit the page.

00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:01,519
And any issues that we've received since they have come through that shared inbox.

00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:13,660
So, the thing that I would call out there is that a cis is that as a cis white hetero

00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:21,309
able bodied man, the most marginalized communities may not trust me.

00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:26,990
If you're an event organizer, or you're running some sort of initiative in the workplace,

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:32,690
please bear in mind that as a cis white hetero able bodied man, the most marginalized in

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:40,179
our communities may not trust you.

00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:46,490
We hear the term "People from underrepresented and marginalized groups" a lot.

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,620
These two things go hand in hand.

00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,289
What's the difference?

00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:56,110
White women are underrepresented in tech.

00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,790
They're not marginalized.

00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:03,830
People of color, particularly women of color are marginalized.

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:11,260
Members of the trans community are marginalized.

00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:18,399
With that in mind, as a cis white hetero able bodied person, the most marginalized in our

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,100
communities may not trust you.

00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:41,010
If this is something that you would like to learn more about, I would recommend following

00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,900
Kim Crayton.

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:54,309
Kim will be sharing her lived experience online and does.

00:30:54,309 --> 00:31:00,700
And I would highly if anything I have said in the last few minutes has made you perhaps

00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:08,399
uncomfortable, I would suggest just sitting with that rather than having perhaps emotional

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,330
or defensive reaction to that.

00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,850
And just try and figure out why.

00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:24,950
And so, Kim shares her perspective and continually makes everybody aware that she will be making

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:32,179
you feel uncomfortable by, I suppose, yeah.

00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:39,570
Sharing her experience as a black woman.

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,399
I would also like to point you to Julien's talk from Monday.

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,220
I thought that was an amazing talk.

00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,309
Introducing us to a whole load of scenarios and terminology that we might not have been

00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,870
aware of.

00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:57,080
If you haven't seen Julien's talk, please catch the video.

00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:10,480
And so, bearing all of this in mind, there are people who have raised issues and sent

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:17,830
them into our shared global code of conduct email account.

00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:24,490
If I go back just a little bit.

00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:34,960
What if there's people that haven't got in touch because that picture's on there?

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,380
We want to support the most marginalized in our communities because we know that they

00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:46,730
are actively harmed every day in big and small ways.

00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:52,500
Intentionally and not.

00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,380
And for that reason, I am gonna be stepping out of this team to let the people who have

00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:06,399
similar lived experiences to the people we are aiming to support handle those.

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:14,450
And ideally, just by trying to be transparent and list all the people there, if I'm going

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:22,970
to be a barrier to that, I am gonna step out of that.

00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:31,650
So, the next thing to call out you hear lots of people with lots of good intentions.

00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,940
There's people writing lots of blog posts about diversity and inclusion in the community

00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:40,000
and the workplace, in companies.

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,409
That's lovely.

00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:45,950
But for change to happen, there needs to be action.

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:57,389
If there is no action, good intentions and talk, it just really doesn't count for anything.

00:33:57,389 --> 00:34:08,310
So, just in summary, it's to give you some stats around the events themselves.

00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:16,350
In February 2018, we had 53 workshops all around the world supporting over a thousand

00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,080
people who attended.

00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:24,980
In 2019, we had over 80 well, we had 81 workshops.

00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:30,480
Over 360 volunteers making this happen for over 2,000 attendees.

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:39,070
At this point I would like to ask anybody in the room who is involved in organizing

00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:49,670
or mentoring or facilitating at one of these events, could you come up and join me, please.

00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,320
Come on, Ramon.

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,090
And while folks are making their way here, I would like to introduce you to our Boston

00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:02,700
workshop this year.

00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:09,130
This is the folks from our workshop in Nablus in Palestine.

00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:12,340
Glasgow, Scotland.

00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:21,810
And a very enthusiastic bunch in Johannesburg in South Africa.

00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,930
Whoops.

00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:30,400
At this point, could you please give all of these people a huge, huge round of applause

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,290
for making this happen.

00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:43,790
[ Applause ] And I'm gonna keep you here for a bit longer,

00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,790
sorry.

00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,270
It's just for effect.

00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:53,710
So, the people that we've not really heard from or talked specifically about are the

00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:59,370
people who have come through this event and went on to become speakers.

00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:06,980
And this is just a small group of the people that have done that.

00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,920
And when we look at social media, we hear things when we're talking about diversity

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,810
and inclusion is we hear things like: Diversity will bring us will help make our products

00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,810
better.

00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,810
Our teams better.

00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,190
Our events better.

00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,660
By bringing a whole lot of new experiences and, yeah.

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:32,410
Experiences and perspectives.

00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:37,160
But we never really hear of sort of like concrete examples of how that's happened.

00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,960
So, I would like to introduce you to Suz.

00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,090
Suz attended our London workshop this year.

00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:49,280
About a month later gave a talk which was all about her experience of changing career

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:58,140
from working in the metropolitan police force to becoming a programmer.

00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:04,780
And I know I haven't looked at YouTube, this is the thousands upon thousands of views already.

00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,820
And the thing that I want to say there is that, as a cis white hetero able bodied man,

00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,000
that's not a talk that I could give.

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,500
I'm sure there's some men that could.

00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,390
And I'm sure there's some that may attempt to bluff their way through it.

00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:24,190
If that's the case, let's see how you might feel about Benedict's talk.

00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:29,710
Benedict is at the top right here and she attended our Oslo workshop.

00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:39,550
Talking about her side project which is a web based privacy first media tracker.

00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:45,000
This is something that I am in no way qualified to talk about.

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,650
I'm not even gonna I could not attempt yeah.

00:37:53,650 --> 00:38:03,840
This let's see.

00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,470
Tech has come a long way in the last couple of years in terms of diversity and inclusion.

00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,520
But it has such a long way to go.

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:22,050
Our society, our world, to achieve any level serious level of equality, really needs to

00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,310
change.

00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:30,570
These are just some of the people taking that step forward a very brave step forward

00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,320
putting themselves out there to make that change happen.

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,580
They are the real models for the people that come after them.

00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:47,290
Yes, by becoming a tech speaker, there will be the benefits to each of these people individually.

00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,550
There will be opportunities for travel.

00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:56,570
There will be better networking opportunities which can lead to, you know, better career

00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,570
opportunities.

00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,420
Yes, it benefits them individually.

00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:13,600
However, collectively, they are all enriching all of us.

00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:24,280
And it only seems appropriate for someone who has been through this process to close

00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,490
out this talk.

00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,660
I would like to welcome Ariba Jahan.

00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:36,470
[ Applause ] ARIBA: Hi.

00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:46,420
I think some of you might have seen me here yesterday.

00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:52,860
So, as an immigrant woman of color with a disability who switched careers from biomechanical

00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:57,100
engineering to product and tech, there's not a lot of rooms where I can just watch in and

00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,080
automatically feel a sense of belonging.

00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,070
But I did at Global CFP Day.

00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:08,770
When I first became interested or curious about speaking, there weren't many resources

00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,990
available that easily walked through how did people figure this out?

00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,820
Where did they find the opportunity?

00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,640
How did they craft an idea?

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,170
How did they design a talk?

00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,840
How did they show up on stage?

00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,960
It somehow felt like there was a group of people that just knew how to do all the things.

00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,680
And then there was the rest of us.

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:35,360
And and I think Global CFP Day was the first resource and community that I discovered

00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,060
that felt very accessible and made for people like me.

00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:44,870
Where it was okay to just not know what to do and know that we could all collectively

00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,290
figure it out together.

00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:52,620
So, that experience started a journey in me journey for me that eventually got me to

00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,670
this stage yesterday.

00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,980
That was my first talk.

00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:01,571
And I couldn't have done it without having that community to show up to feel like, I

00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:03,310
don't know what I'm doing.

00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:09,220
But I'm hoping someone can help me.

00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:16,656
So, if you're in the audience today and you think that you don't have anything to share,

00:41:16,656 --> 00:41:17,656
I want you to know, someone needs to hear your story.

00:41:17,656 --> 00:41:18,656
You know?

00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:23,690
Even if the talk subject has been shared before, your lens and your experience with that has

00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,210
to be shared.

00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:34,600
So, find your local CFP chapter and learn with them.

00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,280
Thank you.

00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,630
[ Applause ] PETER: Thank you.

00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,310
Thank you.

00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,310
Cheers.
