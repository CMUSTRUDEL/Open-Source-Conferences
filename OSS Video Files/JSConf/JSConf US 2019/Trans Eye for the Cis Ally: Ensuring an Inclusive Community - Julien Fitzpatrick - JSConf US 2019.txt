Title: Trans Eye for the Cis Ally: Ensuring an Inclusive Community - Julien Fitzpatrick - JSConf US 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-11
Playlist: JSConf US 2019
Description: 
	Trans and non-binary people are becoming increasingly visible in the workplace, as well as in community spaces such as meetups and conferences. Most managers and event organizers want to be inclusive and welcoming but frequently, in spite of their best intentions, often come up short. Wouldn’t it be nice to have an actual non-binary trans person just tell you what you should be doing and why? VOILA! Allow me to swoop in and fix your interview process, your community event, even your office space! Can you believe? Shamazing!

Trans Eye for the Cis Ally: Ensuring an Inclusive Community

00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,689
Julien Fitzpatrick >> I'm kidding  I do  I love that song.

00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,780
I know all of the words to that song.

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,980
So, I don't know if I'll be able to do karaoke tonight because it's really late for me because

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,610
it's like three hours later inside of my body than it is here.

00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,610
So, but if I can, I will sing that song in karaoke, I promise.

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,610
Yes.

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,610
All right.

00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,610
So, I am extremely, extremely excited for our next presenter.

00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,610
This is a topic that is very near and dear to my heart.

00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,610
I am always trying to be a better ally.

00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,610
And I think it really speaks volumes about this community and the values that this community

00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,610
holds that we have a talk like this interspersed with all of the amazing cool, wow tech stuff.

00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,610
So, Julien Fitzpatrick is gonna be teaching us about how to be a trans ally and build

00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,610
more inclusive spaces.

00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,610
So, give it up for them.

00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,610
Are you ready?

00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,610
Yeah.

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,610
Give it up for Julien.

00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,610
[ Applause ] JULIEN: Hello, what's up, everybody?

00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,610
Welcome to trans eye for the cis ally.

00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,610
My name is Julien, I use they/them pro nouns.

00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,610
I used to be a cartoonist, now a software engineer.

00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,610
I have been working as a programmer for the last four and a half years or so.

00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,610
I work at a company called Artemis.

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,610
This is an indoor agriculture management platform.

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,610
We are hiring, of course.

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,280
So feel free to talk to me later.

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,730
In my spare time, I enjoy power lifting, hanging out with my really cute dog.

00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,300
His name JPEG.

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,910
That always gets a really big laugh from programming conferences.

00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,149
I like to obsessively read about Freddie Mercury's life.

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,340
And finally, I'm like kind of a Queer Eye super fan.

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,170
So, what is Queer Eye?

00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,320
Before we get to the actual topic of the talk, I feel like I should give a little background

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,730
regarding Queer Eye just so we're all on the same page.

00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,730
Queer Eye is a show on Netflix, currently, that on its surface is a makeover show.

00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:25,780
Five gay guys take one person each episode, make over their hair, clothes, their house,

00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,890
their cooking ability, but most importantly, their feelings.

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,360
Usually it's someone who's had kind of a hard time in their life and they've struggled and

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,720
the fab five, as they're called, come together to help them get their whole life together.

00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,540
Almost every episode of the show ends up being pretty emotional.

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,270
So, if you've never watched it before and you really to want watch a feel good kind

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,000
of tearjerker show, I would recommend it.

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,330
I should also mention that before I go on, even though I'm definitely a super fan of

00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,840
the show, I don't think it's perfect.

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,830
There have been a lot of really valid critiques about aspects of the show.

00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,140
Even though I'm not going to talk about those things right now, I'm happy to talk about

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,540
various critiques of Queer Eye in the hall or on Twitter.

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,820
If you want to do that, let me know.

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,670
So, moving on, what does this have to do with what we're talking about right now?

00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,100
This talk is called trans eye for the cis ally.

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,860
Which is after the original Queer Eye, called Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.

00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,370
I've never watched the original.

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,240
Don't talk to me about it.

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,380
I don't know that much about it at all.

00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,240
It's honestly pretty different from what I've heard from the modern one.

00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,350
In this case, I'm the trans eye and you're probably the cis ally.

00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,070
If you're here, you are likely interested in making your workplaces and events more

00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,930
inclusive for trans people.

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,170
Which is great.

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,360
The truth is, there are so many small things and some larger things that you can do to

00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,470
not only give your existing trans coworkers and community members a good experience, but

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,250
also to make sure that even if you don't currently have any trans coworkers or community members,

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,060
you're providing a space and experience that will be welcoming in the future.

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,670
So, let's start with the basics.

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,630
Not even the basics, but like the basics of the basics.

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,569
So, what is trans?

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,090
What is cis?

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,250
The simple answer is that trans means you don't identify  or transgender means you

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,300
don't identify with the gender you were assigned at birth.

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,300
That's it.

00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,560
Not everybody who feels this way ends up identifying with or using the word trans to identify themselves.

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,690
But the word is there if they want to use it.

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,390
For example, a trans man was assigned female at birth and figured out later that he was

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,390
male.

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,370
And a trans woman would be someone who is assigned male at birth and later realized

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,120
that she was female.

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,050
It's not that complicated.

00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,050
Yeah.

00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,200
Cis just means you do identify as the gender you were assigned at birth.

00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,310
That's most people.

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,530
If the doctor said it's a boy when you were born, and you're a boy, congratulations, you're

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,530
cis.

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,290
Not hard.

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:16,150
Transgender and cis  people can't be transgendered and cis gendered.

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,459
We jokingly say this, I trans'd you.

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,240
But you can't do that.

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,040
If you want to be respectful, use the words correctly.

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:33,950
And non binary, you're somewhere outside of the male/female binary.

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,100
There's a few common misconceptions about what non binary means.

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,110
It doesn't mean gender neutral or androgynous.

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,870
Or assigned female at birth and leans masculine.

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,770
Non binary, it could mean that for some people.

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,900
There's not one way to be non binary or two or three ways.

00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,620
It means you don't fit into the binary and this is the word you have chosen to describe

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,680
yourself.

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,780
Technically, it falls under the trans umbrella.

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,320
So, some non binary people don't consider themselves trans.

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,630
This is fine.

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,250
If someone tells you they're non binary and they're not trans, just say cool.

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,860
Serve different.

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,020
It's okay if you don't understand.

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,370
Something really important that cis people don't get is it's okay for you to not understand

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,560
trans people in order to respect us and treat us with dignity.

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,220
I don't know what it's like to be cis or straight.

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,840
It doesn't stop me from being able to respect others.

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,690
You don't have to totally understand what it's like to be someone in order to respect

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,120
someone.

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,669
Pronouns are a really good example.

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:47,350
So, when someone first comes out as trans or you meet a trans person.

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,570
They might want to use different pronouns.

00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:55,120
To you, they might not look like someone who uses the pronouns.

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,460
Or maybe they/them pronouns and you have never done that before.

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,460
Try.

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,669
All you have to do is try, you don't have to get it.

00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:11,210
If you mess up, just quickly apologize, correct yourself, don't make a big deal out of it

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,770
and eventually it will be second nature to you.

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:20,310
So, while we're talking about pronouns, I should mention as an aside that a person's

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,030
pronouns are just a person's pronouns.

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,699
My pronouns are they/them.

00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:27,540
It's become common for people to say preferred pronouns.

00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,920
But only when they're talking about trans people.

00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,960
Everybody has pronouns.

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,110
They're not preferred, they're just pronouns.

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,139
Also worth mentioning, some people have done this in my life in the past.

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,380
Some people think they can use they/them for everyone because it's a simple solution to

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,080
having to remember the pronouns for everybody.

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,060
This is not great.

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,229
If you have a trans person using he/him pronouns, and you call him they, you're still mis gendering

00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:56,820
him.

00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,820
Think of it this way.

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,330
You have to think of different names for everyone you know.

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,639
There's probably three different gender pronouns that you have to learn.

00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,130
Compared to learning all those names, it's honestly not that hard.

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:17,330
So, now that we've discussed some basics, let's move on to the next level and talk about

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,510
what you can actually do right now to make things better and more welcoming for trans

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,199
and non binary people at your company or your event or your meetup group or whatever.

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,949
So, back to pronouns.

00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,420
For me, as a non binary, it's impossible for someone to guess what my pronouns are just

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,390
by looking at me.

00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,979
My life is a series of awkward situations in which I have to figure out how to tell

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:49,330
a single person or a few people or a whole room of people they use they/them pronouns.

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,750
This is the case for binary trans people too.

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,790
Just because I have to do it all the time doesn't mean I'm good at it.

00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,070
Or that I'm used to it.

00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,190
I kind of hate it.

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:05,090
So, a really simple way to mitigate this is just be proactive and make sure that people

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,130
are given every opportunity state their pronouns.

00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,270
At the beginning of a meeting when a new person is interesting introduced to the company or

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,330
whatever, just have whoever is running the meeting start by being, like, my name is so

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,330
and so.

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,570
My pronouns are, you know, they/them or he/him.

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,840
And just have all the employees just kind of be an example.

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,970
Make it a normal thing.

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,010
If you have an employee page on your website, you can have people include their pronouns.

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,050
This also helps prospective employees know that you tend to be a trans inclusive space.

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,339
It's something I look at when I'm looking at people's job pages.

00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,120
If they have pronouns, cool.

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,800
Honestly the bar  it's slightly above the worst.

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,639
That's great.

00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,040
So, same goes for events.

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,790
Anywhere a person's name is listed, if they want to include their pronouns you can include

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,899
their pronouns as well.

00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,050
You can offer pronoun stickers or pins like we have here.

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,800
Or just have a way people can write their pronouns on their badges large enough that

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,350
people can see them easily.

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,079
Something I really like about these pins actually.

00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,290
I have been to a lot of conferences with a lot of pronoun things and I like this because

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,740
you can read it easily, it's large.

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,980
You can put it anywhere you want.

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
You can make is visible.

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,829
I think that's the best solution.

00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:33,949
Even if you're cis, put the pin on and whatever, write your pronouns.

00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,899
Because you can encourage other people to do the same.

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:41,050
Just make sure like when you introduce yourself to people you say your pronouns.

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,000
Just, you know, that sort of thing.

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,899
So, this picture of pronoun stickers is from a meetup where I live in Portland.

00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,509
That's called Donut.JS, which is pretty great.

00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:55,610
Yeah, make sure people know if they're interviewing candidates to introduce themselves with their

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,730
name and pronouns and ask if the candidates want to do the same.

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,240
Your company or event has a Slack, make sure everyone know they can include their pronouns

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,470
or have the leaders include their pronouns in the profile.

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,860
Make it a thing not only the trans people have to deal with.

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,160
It kinds of sucks.

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,440
And also something I haven't written in my notes.

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,999
I'm going ad lib, whoa.

00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:25,769
Something people talked about and mentioned a few times is you shouldn't force people

00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,329
to share their pronouns.

00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:28,329
That's also a thing.

00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:33,089
Like, it's great to be really encouraging about it, but some people are in the closet

00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:34,639
and it sucks.

00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,929
Even though it's totally understandable.

00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:39,100
I'm going to refer to you with a third person pronoun.

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,470
Tell me what you want to use.

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,920
It's so stressful for people in the closet to have to think about it and put the wrong

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,699
one up.

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,100
I've had people tell me that before when I talk about pronouns.

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,649
I wanted to mention that.

00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:53,649
Don't force people.

00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:59,449
But, you know, encouraging and if you know you're cis, put your pronoun on.

00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:05,670
So, on that note, you might to want consider if you do have a trans employee or a co worker,

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:11,730
you might to want ask them what, if anything, they want you to do if another employee mis

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,269
genders them.

00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,989
Don't assume everyone is bold enough to correct other people, especially if they're new.

00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:22,069
And on the same token, don't assume they want you to say or do anything.

00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,059
Leave it up to them.

00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,970
But find out in advance.

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:33,220
I can say  depending on the person, it could happen constant lily for them and it's gonna

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
come up.

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,779
So, you want to know the right response ahead of time.

00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:42,459
On that note, if you've hired a trans person or someone has just come out to you as trans

00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:46,309
and you're wondering if something is okay, you should not assume.

00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:47,579
You should ask.

00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,179
So, for example, you have a non binary employee.

00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,839
This is actually a thing that happen to me at my old job when I came out.

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,179
So, usually when you go to conferences you have like  so, in our case we previously

00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:05,079
had an even split of male and female employees and we would share hotel rooms at conferences.

00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:11,130
But instead of just assuming which person I wanted to room with, my boss was like, hey,

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,059
how do you feel about this?

00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,470
Which person do you want to room with?

00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,149
Do you want your own room?

00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,069
That sort of thing.

00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:21,740
Yeah, don't assume what people want.

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,170
Just ask.

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,209
But also sometimes don't ask.

00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:30,110
So  so, like, stuff like that, yeah.

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,110
You should ask.

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,589
But there's a ton of thing that is you should never ask.

00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:38,589
Luckily this is, I think, really easy to figure out.

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:40,310
But it still happens all the time.

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,089
So, think like before you ask somebody a question, ask yourself if it would be okay to ask a

00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,379
cis employee.

00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,939
It's not okay to ask a trans employee if it's not okay to ask a cis employee.

00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:53,579
So, don't ask if they've had the surgery.

00:12:53,579 --> 00:13:00,240
Like, the surgery is like some abstract concept that is not real.

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,779
So, just  it's ridiculous.

00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:04,779
Anyway.

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,179
Don't ask literally any question that has to do with their body.

00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:10,910
But especially their genitals.

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,989
Like, you know?

00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:16,639
Don't ask invasive medical questions.

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,249
You might think that these things are obvious.

00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,240
But it happens all the time.

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,249
It's extremely common as a trans person to have people you barely know casually asking

00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:28,949
you about what's in your pants.

00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:30,549
So, don't do that.

00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,610
It's not appropriate.

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,610
Health insurance.

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,970
So, don't wait until a trans person is interviewing for a job at your company to find out if you

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,859
have trans inclusive health insurance.

00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:44,749
You should find out today.

00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:48,490
Most insurance companies these days have like a section in their literature specifically

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,480
about what is and what is not covered with regards to trans health care.

00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:00,860
So, just take some time and familiarize yourself with it so when they ask, you can answer.

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,149
Bathrooms come up a lot.

00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,029
You probably don't put a lot of thought into them yourself.

00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,019
And for a lot of trans people, it's a minefield.

00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:15,240
And it's important that you know and understand the extent to which we fret and worry and

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,769
stress out about them so that you can come to it from a place of empathy.

00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:25,499
So, one of the reasons I love working remote, personally, is I never have to worry about

00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:28,769
the drama of using a gendered office bathroom.

00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:33,119
In the best scenario, feeling an.

00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:42,059
Sometimes I waited until all the men left and went to a meeting and then go to the men's

00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,059
room.

00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:45,160
Especially if I didn't know all of them.

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,420
Sometimes I even left an office to use a gender neutral bathroom in a basement or a coffee

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,129
shop nearby.

00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:57,450
If I'm at an event like a conference or a meetup if I don't know the bathroom situation

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:04,339
beforehand, sometimes I will stop drinking liquids hours ahead of time even if I'm thirsty

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:10,019
or I won't eat even if I'm hungry to avoid having to use the bathroom because I don't

00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,209
know what the deal is.

00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:16,009
Unless I know there's at least one gender neutral restroom available.

00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:19,009
Then I'm not worried.

00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:24,629
So, what I'm saying is for some trans people, not all of us, mind you, but definitely a

00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:27,970
lot of us, we put a lot more thought into bathrooms than you might think.

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,449
So, what are some ways that you can deal with this?

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:36,559
The best case scenario is that you have single stall gender neutral restrooms.

00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,529
This is the holy grail of the trans restroom experience.

00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:46,189
It's the least anxiety inducing experience.

00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:49,399
Just degender gendered bathrooms.

00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:55,069
There's no reason for a single stall bathroom with a door that closes to have a gender.

00:15:55,069 --> 00:16:01,610
And maybe you have bathrooms in several locations.

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:07,889
Is it possible that you could put signs up on one and make that gender neutral?

00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:14,559
Sometimes events like this event we're at together, sometimes they put up temporary

00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,779
signs over one set of bathroom to make them gender neutral for that one event.

00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:24,699
So, if you do have gender neutral bathrooms, but they're hard to find, that also happens

00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:25,699
a lot.

00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:29,750
I have called myself a truffle pig for gender neutral restrooms.

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,069
I will find it.

00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:40,150
I've had people at conferences be like, where's the  brought you a map.

00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,150
Yeah.

00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,150
Put up signage.

00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,589
This is helpful if it's somewhere else.

00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:51,589
Put signage by the gendered bathrooms so people know where to find the gender neutral ones.

00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:57,040
It's worth a thought if you're hosting a company event or an offsite that's a little more casual

00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,410
like a small group.

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:04,910
It would be great if they could do recon on the bathroom situation in advance so that

00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,000
the trans people can know if there's, you know, what's the situation?

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,210
Where I live in Portland, it's common, a lot of bars and restaurants now have gender neutral

00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,630
restrooms.

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:19,380
But it's not like to when I go to company offsite.

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,310
Anyway, this might be a little bit of an unusual tip.

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,920
And also might be totally unnecessary depending on your company.

00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:33,900
But personally, if I'm in a situation where I have to use gendered bathrooms, like in

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,950
a sports bar or someplace that's really like just men.

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:47,030
I  sometimes I like to have a bathroom buddy who will go in first for me and will be like

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,380
there is, you know, this many stalls.

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,720
The stalls are full.

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,140
There's three urinals or whatever.

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,180
Tell me what's going on in there so that I can know ahead of time.

00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,180
Yeah.

00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,760
Occasionally I like my friend to go in with me if it's really bad.

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,190
But that's pretty rare.

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,270
Year, I wrote this, already said it.

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:12,250
It come up in really masculine bars, sports bars.

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,210
You don't have to do anything huge.

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:21,310
If you have a good friendship and they use the same bathroom, it's worth privately at

00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,790
these events, if you want someone to come with you, I'll go with you.

00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,140
But not everyone wants this.

00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,100
So, as I said, it depends on the kind of relationship that you have with your co worker.

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,950
I've had friends do it for me and it's been really helpful.

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,560
It really sucks to be out at a bar with your coworkers and you feel like you have to leave

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,880
early or you have to miss out on things because you don't want to use the bathroom there.

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,031
And sometimes depending on the event and who is there, it can be like you're missing out

00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:51,600
on actually a really important networking opportunity.

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,430
So, it's worth keeping in mind when planning events or off sites.

00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,950
But again, it's like don't just approach any co worker like this.

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,270
Like you should know that you're really good friends.

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,470
Otherwise it's really weird.

00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,600
So, speaking of company off sites and events.

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,830
Sometimes you  sometimes you might find yourself traveling to and from an airport with a trans

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,830
co worker.

00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,250
You probably know how terrible TSA is.

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,740
Like, have you heard?

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,440
But you might not be aware of like how awful it can be for some trans people.

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,000
So, unfortunately there's not a whole lot you can personally do.

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,820
But there's like ways you can be supportive.

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,900
So, you might not be aware of this, but the scanners they put you through at the airport

00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,160
require the operator on the other side to decide over the course of about a second whether

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,150
to put you through as male or female.

00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:50,350
So, the way the scanner scans your body for bombs or whatever is that it sort of compares

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,760
your body to what it expects a male or a female body to look like.

00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,700
So, for example, before I had surgery but after I was on testosterone, I was stopped

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,600
and frisked every single time for chest abnormalities.

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:12,120
And I still sometimes get stopped and frisked for groin abnormalities.

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,260
But I had to get into the habit of stepping into the machine, this is a thing I did when

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,260
I had boobs.

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,750
I would step into the machine lean out and say, hey!

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,480
I have boobs!

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,660
Hey!

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,750
Usually they would be like  uh?

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,490
What do you want me to do about it?

00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,490
Just press the female button.

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,920
Press the female button and then it would be fine.

00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,570
But, yeah, it's not for everybody.

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,650
So, sometimes yeah.

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,570
Literally depending on the mood of the TSA agent and how trans phobic they are, it can

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:54,170
go extremely poorly and result in a humiliating experience if you're trans.

00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,830
If you're in the cis person in the situation, you don't have to do a lot.

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,280
Make sure you're nearby in the security line.

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,430
Pay attention to how the TSA is treating your co worker.

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,630
This is rare.

00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,520
But just be prepared to serve as a witness if things go bad.

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,060
Consider having your phone ready to record if something goes really bad and you have

00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,060
proof.

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:21,250
if they are going to move them, step in and say, hey, can I go with you?

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,760
Most of the time, it's just slightly awkward.

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,820
But things can and do go bad for trans people moving through TSA.

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,740
It's important because this could happen to a co worker or friend.

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:42,440
Being traumatized by TSA is a pretty bad start to the work trip.

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:50,180
There was an article in The New York Times, flying while trans that you can read.

00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,740
It goes over a specific bad experience that one person went through.

00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,390
So, one thing you might not have considered is how much more trans friendly your workplace

00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,610
becomes when you let people work remote.

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,350
Even if you have a primarily real life office, if you let people work remote, as much or

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,200
as little as they like without having to explain, I'm working remote today.

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,080
You unintentionally solve a lot of problems that trans people have in offices.

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:29,490
And some have days or weeks or months where their dysphoria is really bad.

00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,500
It can be really debilitating if you have it bad.

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,880
Sometimes it's easier to be remote.

00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,960
You don't have to manage your dysphoria in an office setting where there's triggers.

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,630
I don't get much anymore.

00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:50,370
But when I wore a binder, the ways that my clothes fit would be a huge trigger.

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:57,250
On one occasion I had a panic attack at an event because of that and I had to go home.

00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,250
Yeah.

00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,770
It just sucks.

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,870
So, sometimes if  when I used to wear a binder.

00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,360
It's really uncomfortable, restricts your breathing.

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Makes your chest hurt.

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,600
You're not supposed to wear it more than eight hours if I had to go somewhere after work,

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,690
wear it for eight hours and go somewhere else and be in incredible pain.

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,520
You're not supposed to do that.

00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,740
You can literally break a rib.

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,880
Yeah, working remote means that you don't have to do that.

00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,820
If you want to go to an event later, you don't have to wear the binder all day.

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,700
That sort of thing.

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,590
So, struggs to func.

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:42,860
It really goes for any marginalized group, but you might not be aware, trans people's

00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,440
rights are on the line constantly.

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,920
We have become a popular target of public discussion in the news and a large variety

00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,450
of other media.

00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,410
If you're trans, it's almost impossible to ignore.

00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,090
And hard to deal with.

00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,830
Because I heard that the Supreme Court is going to decide whether I should be protected

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,710
from discrimination in the workplace.

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,710
Great.

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,410
Yeah, there's also the talk about rolling back health care protections.

00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,570
Yeah.

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:15,160
So, it's really stressful and terrifying and it's hard to not let this kind of news affect

00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,750
you when it has to do with your day to day life.

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,580
Especially when sometimes it feels like nobody even cares.

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,770
So, what can you do?

00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,620
I strongly recommend reading this blog post by Lara Hogan from 2018 called Managering

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:34,550
in Terrible Times that makes a lot of good suggestions.

00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:39,310
Personally I like seeing a show of public support for coworkers.

00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,650
Seeing them Tweet support is great.

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,610
At the last job, my boss put these trans flags everywhere during pride.

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,650
It was really cute.

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,170
So, wonderful.

00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:53,890
In recent years, I've noticed a trend among meetups and conferences and stuff that used

00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,960
to be for women in tech that are trying to rename themselves to be more inclusive.

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,580
But unfortunately it often seems like they're not really sure who they want to be inclusive

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
of.

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,650
They end up naming themselves women and non binary or women and femmes.

00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,640
And nobody knows what it means.

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,400
Womxn.

00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:21,320
This is a truly well meaning way of organizers to be inclusive of women, but maybe not trans

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
men.

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,690
There's a lot of confusion about who they want to be inclusive of, what the best wording

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,700
is based on who they want to include.

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,300
If you're confused, I don't blame you.

00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,190
It's confusing.

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:40,060
So, let's see what we can do about this.

00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,721
First of all, I'm gonna assume whatever event we're going to be talking about, it probably

00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:49,050
started as something for women because women are still an underrepresented gender in tech

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,680
and they're still a marginalized group.

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,960
Many women experience misogyny and discrimination in the workplace.

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,980
And many were raised to particular personality traits, not rocking the boat, not speaking

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,150
up, and this is a male dominated field.

00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,770
Most men were raised to be the opposite of the traits.

00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,670
It can be exceptionally hard for women to forge a path.

00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:20,130
It makes sense that groups have popped up so women in tech can organize.

00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:25,940
In recent years women's spaces have, you know, they've decided that they want to be more

00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,320
inclusive of trans women, which is great.

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,730
As people have become more aware of the existence of trans women and their collective need to

00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:40,540
be accepted in women's spaces, and become aware of others, usually non binary.

00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:46,100
Usually they become aware of non binary people because someone in the group who formerly

00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,370
was in the group comes out as non binary.

00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:54,050
And they don't to want exclude that person, so they call themselves women and non binary.

00:26:54,050 --> 00:27:01,840
This causes issues because non binary means a lot of things, and femme means way more

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,570
than people think it does.

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,930
The messaging is confused.

00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:14,630
Non binary people are assigned male, there's people like me who were assigned female and

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:18,270
for lack of a better phrase now look like men to most people.

00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,200
Even though we're all non binary.

00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,809
A lot of us wouldn't feel comfortable going to the event, women and non binary, or women

00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,980
and femmes.

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,090
Not to mention trans men who are often ignored or forgotten.

00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:37,850
They're still a large group who might have experienced many or all of the situation or

00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,390
problems as women in tech and they're completely excluded.

00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,370
So, what should you call it?

00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,370
Yeah.

00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,483
I just want to get it out of the way that it's absolutely fine and okay to have something

00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:49,500
that's just for women.

00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,360
You're under no obligation to include other genders.

00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:59,860
And think about the mission, who you're including and excluding and why.

00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,880
I especially ask that you give serious consideration to why you would exclude trans men because

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,740
you probably are.

00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,800
Most but not all of the time these groups and events with actually mean to include everyone

00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,880
who is not a cis men.

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:20,281
Everyone assigned female at birth, male at birth, non binary people, trans women, some

00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,540
intersex people.

00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,340
If you have taken the time to thick the mission of your group or event, think, I want to include

00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,180
all genders.

00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:36,300
Strongly encourage you changing the name and mission and call it marginalized genders.

00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,980
It avoids describing your group in opposition to something that it's not and instead describes

00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,980
who it is for.

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,820
You can put an asterisk next to the name and be more descriptive or put not cis men in

00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
the space.

00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,910
Or be sure you're accurately naming your group.

00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:56,020
There's consulting you can hire to help out with that.

00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,320
I'm running out of time.

00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:06,610
But my last tip is not to like  if someone in your office is trans and you want to look

00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,010
something up on the Internet, like, don't do that.

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,370
Don't look them up on the Internet in front of everybody because you can unwittingly show

00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:17,740
their birth name and all other information that they would rather not show you unwittingly.

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,740
Anyway.

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:26,690
In closing, I want to reiterate that there are things you should think about today.

00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,240
Don't wait, you know.

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,309
Do it now.

00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,010
I'm also happy to speak in more detail about any of this stuff afterwards.

00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,320
So, feel free to come up to me or Tweet at me or whatever.

00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,510
There's a lot of things I didn't get to speak in as much detail as I wanted.

00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,510
I'm happy to talk more.

00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:47,710
If you have a really complex concern, I will refer you to someone who does that for a living.

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,710
Not me.

00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,930
I'm just a regular person.

00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,950
But for most basic questions, I'm happy to answer them.

00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,170
Finally, I feel bad that all of my Queer Eye GIFs, Bobby has been underrepresented.

00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,110
here is one of the few Bobby GIFs I could find.

00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,431
Hopefully you can see why I wasn't able toll find a place for it.

00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:05,431
That's it.

00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:06,431
I'm Julien.

00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:07,431
You should talk to me.

00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,431
Thank you.

00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,431
[ Applause ] KATIE: Oh my gosh, thank you, Julien.

00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:10,431
I learned so much.

00:30:10,431 --> 00:30:11,431
I really appreciate you sharing your experience with all of us.

00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:12,431
If anyone needs a good name for their formerly women and non binary people group at work,

00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:13,431
at Etsy we've recently renamed to magic, which is short for marginalized gender identity

00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:14,431
community.

00:30:14,431 --> 00:30:15,431
So, you are free to take Magic and use it in your own company if you want to have a

00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:16,431
group that encompasses all genders.

00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:17,431
anyways.

00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:18,431
We're going to take a little break.

00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:19,431
Come back at 2:15.

00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:20,431
Sara Fecadu is going to be talking about how music gets from your computer out into the

00:30:20,431 --> 00:30:21,431
speakers or something like that.

00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:22,431
Anyways, it's going to be really cool.

00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:23,431
I'll see you back here at 2:15.

00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:23,432
