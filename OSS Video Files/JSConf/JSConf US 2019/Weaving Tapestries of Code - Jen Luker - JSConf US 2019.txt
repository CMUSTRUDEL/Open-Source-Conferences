Publication date: 2019-09-17
Playlist: JSConf US 2019
Description: 
	Yarns, fibers, and fabrics. You have more in common with the weavers of yesteryear than you realize. In this expedition into the past of fiber arts, we'll explore how our coding art is the continuation of our ancestors at the loom, how you can learn lessons from their patterns, and maybe a thing or two about that nice sweater you're wearing.
