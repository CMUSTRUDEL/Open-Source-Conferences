Publication date: 2019-09-17
Playlist: JSConf US 2019
Description: 
	Yarns, fibers, and fabrics. You have more in common with the weavers of yesteryear than you realize. In this expedition into the past of fiber arts, we'll explore how our coding art is the continuation of our ancestors at the loom, how you can learn lessons from their patterns, and maybe a thing or two about that nice sweater you're wearing.

Weaving Tapestries of Code

00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,760
Jen Luker

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,760
PARISS: All right. So, before we welcome our next speaker on stage, I want to give you

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,760
a few mind blowing fun facts about her. So, she owns three spinning wheels. She thought

00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,064
the movie Hackers was about her. Why, you may ask? Before modems and AOL, she used to

00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:07,860
hack into the telnet system at the University of Utah so she could message a college student

00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,770
in Sydney, Australia, that she befriended through exploring the system. After the university

00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,130
figured out that changing the password wasn't going to stop her from hacking it, they give

00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,320
her her own log in, which was pretty boss. All right. So, weaving tapestries of code,

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
let's welcome Jen Luker. [ Applause ]

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
JEN: Hey, everyone so  this is getting to the end of the last day. How has your conference

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,340
been? Nice? Awesome. Okay. So, weaving tapestries of code. Now, this is gonna be a fun little

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,770
history lesson. Going on a bit of an adventure. Before we get started, some of you are probably

00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:34,180
asking, you know, textiles? Why textiles of all the industries in all the world, why textiles?

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,250
I want to set up a little bit of a history lesson before we get to the history lesson.

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,690
When we are looking at textiles. I want to explain that it takes time to develop the

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:55,350
clothes that we all wear. Back in the mid 17th century, it actually cost about ten days’

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:05,460
worth of work, worth of pay, to pay for a single shirt. So, if you were to take that

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,750
money and translate it to what we do today, there are some calculations that essentially

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:20,950
say that this shirt would cost us between 3 and $5,000. So, we need a few updates that

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,530
actually did progress things quite a lot. We came up with the spinning wheel. Which

00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,630
like one tenth of the time that it took to spin yarn, which was one of the largest chunks.

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:35,860
It dropped the time from 2300 hours to spin the yarn for this shirt down to about 400

00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,980
hours. The other portion was weaving this. Because you're weaving ultra fine threads

00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:48,230
in order to make something durable enough to survive. Most people only bought an outfit

00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:56,250
a year, maybe two. That's it. So, when we're trying to consider the fact that that's how

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:06,030
expensive this shirt was... let's look at these. So, mid 18th century. This was the

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,939
height of fashion in France. This is a ridiculous amount of fabric in that even shows you some

00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:19,280
of the undergarments  not all  but some of the undergarments that the women wore.

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,129
These are highly textured, patterned, beautiful pieces of work. Looking at this, this is the

00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:38,019
most basic thing. 3 $5,000. This is unreal as far as how much this cost. So, if you look

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:47,579
at how much time it took to develop 18th century French silk brocade, this would take between

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:59,169
15 and 27 days of 12 hours a day of weaving. Because a weaver could only do about 2 inches

00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:06,110
per day. These patterns were highly complex. It took two weavers. You had one person that

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:12,260
actually wove the thread and then you had the other person who stood on top of the spinning 

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:20,200
or the loom itself and actually picked up the threads individually. So, this was absolutely

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,219
a bare minimum of a two person job. Taking 15 27 days. Just to make the fabric for the

00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:40,900
outside garment. So, then we get to this picture which is one of the most famous early computing

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,930
pictures ever. This hung on the wall of Charles Babbage amongst others at the time. There

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:53,569
were not that many made. They were commissioned. But they were highly incredible. Charles Babbage

00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:59,519
used to have these really big parties. And he'd invite all of the great names of the

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,180
day. Including the Duke of Wellington who was known to be extremely, extremely smart.

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,760
And Charles Babbage kind of leaned on him and would look at him and say, so, how do

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:20,910
you think this picture was made? And the Duke of Wellington would look at this and he would

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,570
say, well, it looks a lot like a wood cut. And if you look at this wood cut, it actually

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,420
does look a fair amount like that wood cut. Except when you look deeper, it looks more

00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,620
like your suit jacket than it does a wood cut. And that's because everything from the

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:43,690
words on the bottom to the image itself to the background is all woven using a Jacquard

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:55,880
loom. This took 24,000 cards to program. When the average French silk brocade took about

00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:06,840
4,000. It would take months to lay this out. We got the French Jacquard loom starting in

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,130
December of 1800 was when the patent was given. It was put into production in about 1801.

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,480
And it's a little bit misleading because it's not just the loom that we're talking about.

00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:26,340
It's basically that top box was the real innovation. But there's really nothing on this loom that

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:38,930
was unique to Jacquard. In 1725, Bouchon had developed his loom that used a piece of paper

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:45,650
that had punched holes in it to essentially line up and set the process versus the drawlooms

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:53,460
in the day with warp threads that allowed him to pick them up programmatically using

00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:04,061
rods. And in 1728, three years later, his protege, Falcon, developed this one. Those

00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:12,890
pieces of paper are really difficult, because if one rips  and they ripped all the time 

00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,710
if you misplaced is ever so slightly, it would tear. You would have to re create the entire

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:25,300
piece of paper. By dividing them in two cards and having the large holes on the side so

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,580
you can mount them in the places they need to be. The positioning was much more accurate.

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,650
Much less likely to tear and if one did tear, you could just replace one and sew it back

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:44,590
together. So, this was much more user friendly. However, this still required two people because

00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:53,780
you still needed someone to lift up the cords. So, then we have the flying shuttle developed.

00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:00,580
And I don't necessarily mean this shuttle. However, I do mean this shuttle. The reason

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:09,310
I had the previous image is because this is how it works. It shot the flying shuttle across

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:17,250
a room at 60 miles an hour. Preventing a user from having to lift up each thread and moving

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:25,630
it back and forth. By being able to have those things lifted, it did it for you. 20 years

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:37,750
later, almost, we have Vaucanson's loom. His loom was the first automatic loom. Vaucanson

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:49,781
was actually an automaton, he made the tambourine player and this is the digesting duck. This

00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:56,620
is where we get, if it walks like a duck, if it talks like a duck. In fact, some people

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:08,670
jokingly name this the defecating duck. Because this duck would poop. So, if none of these

00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:16,280
ideas are truly unique to Jacquard, why did he get all the credit? The answer to that

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,790
is that he brought all of these pieces to the. From Bouchon's system to lifting threads,

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:32,029
Falcon's card in a loop, Kay's flying shuttle and the control system for switching cards,

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:38,190
that was the first time it was put together in one piece. It was maybe not the first automated

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:50,920
one, but it was the very first user friendly automated machine. Now, unfortunately, right

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,700
about this time, just shy of when this was developed, we had the French Revolution. And

00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,370
more specifically, we had the reign of terror. It took 10 months to kill off one fifth of

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:09,870
the French population. 400,000 people died. Now, though that hit most of the demographics

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:18,130
in France, it was towards the clergy and the aristocracy. Which means that by the time

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:25,120
the Jacquard loom came out, nobody wanted French silk brocade. So, what happened to

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:33,680
our Jacquard loom? Richard Roberts, who developed every single one of the things on this list,

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,660
a wet gas meter, improved lathe, planing machine, power loom, self acting spinning mule, we

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:47,300
could go from four threads  what we could do then  up to 80 threads per machine. Dropping

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:54,230
what used to be 400 hours’ worth of work into 9 minutes. The gear cutting machine,

00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:02,260
the electro magnet and the punching machine. He took Jacquard's loom, specifically the

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:12,500
head, and attached it to something that we now know as a riveter. And because of Richard

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,420
Roberts, we not only have the first automatic powered loom that no longer needs people to

00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:30,230
sit there and weave. We also have industrial, military ships. And bridges. And that's where

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:43,330
it went. All right. So, it only took a few years, really, to get to a great majority

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,520
of the innovation. It took another 50 years for that to really come into play. But once

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:56,660
it did, it very quickly jumped from an automated loom into a powered loom. So, back to Charles

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:02,550
Babbage. One of the reasons why he was so amazed by the Jacquard loom was because he

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:09,400
loved the punch cards. He wanted to develop his machines to use these punch cards in order

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:17,270
to calculate numbers. His difference engine number one was to calculate polynomial functions

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:26,410
to 16 digits. And it would also print out those results for you as a test and then press

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:33,220
into a plate so that you could then print those out later using a printing machine.

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,700
His analytical engine was supposed to be more general purpose. It was supposed to be that

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,589
you could program this machine to perform a calculation for you. And it didn't necessarily

00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:50,490
matter which calculation. And after the development of this engine kind of stalled. The difference

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,360
engine number one stalled, he only developed the portion that you see on the left hand

00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,779
side here. He really dug deep into the analytical machine. And after the analytical machine,

00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:10,030
he improved his difference engine to be accurate to 31 digits. None of these were actually

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:17,500
built until 150 years later. For a while, you could have seen this in San Francisco.

00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,560
It's now in a private collection. However, you can go online and see videos of how this

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:30,120
functions to this day. The machine weighs 5 tons. It's huge. And highly impractical.

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,360
There are 180,000 moving parts. But imagine if this had actually come into fruition when

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:48,850
it was created. What if it had been 150 years earlier? Someone else who attended his lectures

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:58,000
was Menabrea. He was a brilliant, brilliant mathematician. Babbage gave a lecture at the

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,510
University of Turin on his analytical machine. And Menabrea was the one who transcripted

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:16,550
that lecture. The lecture itself was in French. So, he ended up hiring Ada Lovelace to translate

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,790
it back into English. Ada Lovelace, as many of you probably know, is actually the daughter

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:28,270
of Lord Byron, and had a volatile relationship with her mother. To the point that her mother

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:35,310
didn't let her learn art or poetry. She didn't want her daughter to be like Lord Byron who

00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:45,960
had a mental insufficiency or mental instability streak. The problem, though, as strictly mathematical

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:53,750
as she was, she saw the world in a poetic fashion. When she looked at the machine, she

00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,950
looked at the drawings for that analytical machine and saw what it could do, she realized

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:10,540
that machines are not meant just for calculating numbers. That they could do so much more.

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:17,880
And that is her genius. That is her contribution. She ended up publishing the work with enough

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:24,700
footnotes to be much longer than the actual work that she transcribed in the first place.

00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,390
She did have some help from Charles Babbage regarding some of the details of the machine.

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:35,940
The algorithm that she developed was based on a logic structure that previously existed.

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:49,750
So, again, she got a lot of credit because she put it all together. So, quite a few years

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:58,930
later, another 50 or 60 years, we have Herman Hollerith who at his doctorate thesis was

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:06,580
an electronic tabulating machine. The next year, the very first census used punch cards

00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:12,550
from his company to mark off each dot for each person. And at that time it wasn't more

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:18,210
of a combination of dots equaled something as much as this dot meant your gender. This

00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:23,370
to the meant your demographic. This dot meant where you lived. It was a little bit more

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:30,970
specific. All right. By 1911 his company, combined with three other companies to make

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,880
a fifth company called computing tabulating reporting company. Which a few years later

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:46,900
we now know as IBM. In 1928, IBM introduced rectangular hole, 80 column format punch cards.

00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:58,399
Which is why to this day our IDEs default to 88 columns. All based on Jacquard loom

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:07,959
punch cards. So, from 1800 to 1924, something that could have technically been developed

00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:14,589
by 1840. We very well could have had the industrial Revolution and the computing age much earlier

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:24,640
than we did. So, let's talk a little bit about wartime efforts and knitting. This beautiful

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,470
quote I found says, during wartime, where there were knitters, there were often spies.

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:35,779
A pair of eyes watching between the click of two needles. And this was less because

00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:43,149
knitting was used for code and more because people didn't pay attention to knitters. Knitter

00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:52,950
is grandma sitting in the corner. She's just a woman, as they'd say. But those women were

00:16:52,950 --> 00:17:02,580
kind of incredible. So, the very first reference to using knitting in code, or code in knitting,

00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,569
was Madame Defarge from the Tale of Two Cities written by Charles Dickens in 1859. He referred

00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:14,360
to her  she was just a blood thirsty woman who would sit in the meetings where they were

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,780
arguing about who should be the ones to be hauled off to the guillotine and she would

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:28,780
knit the names and stories of those people into her projects. In all reality, though,

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:36,059
I have to say, Belgium had some of the coolest knitters. There's one woman who parachuted

00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:44,750
out of a plane, took her knitting with her, biked around France and  not just Belgium,

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,170
but France and Germany  and would talk to soldiers trying to be helpful and get information

00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:55,980
from them. And then turn around and take that information back. She was one of the few that

00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,200
actually knit some of her information into her work. All right. There's another Belgium

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:08,840
woman whose house and whose window sat over train stations. And so, while she was sitting

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:15,470
there knitting, she would be tapping her foot. And the foot tapping was in Morse code. And

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,990
she would be telling her children in the floor below her what she was seeing out the window.

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,220
Which trains were going where, where they were coming from, what they had in them, what

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:37,390
time it was, all while a German sergeant was living in their house? Another woman based

00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:43,100
on the speed at which she knit was able to do the same thing except as opposed to using

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:49,910
her foot in Morse code, she would do a purl stitch if it was a passenger train and she

00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:55,960
would do a yarn over if it was a supply train so they could record how often they came and

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:06,790
when they came based on her rate of knitting. In World War II, the British Office of Censorship

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,400
banned people from posting knitting patterns abroad because they were afraid that these

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,150
knitting patterns very well could have code in them. And here's one of the reasons they

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:27,090
might have thought that. The sweater I'm wearing today has two messages written into it. I

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:33,950
took the message, converted it to binary, converted binary to knitting stitches and

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:42,370
knitted them into my sweater. So, in this case, ones are knit stitches, zeros are purl

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:49,390
stitches. And yarn overs are the spaces in between the eight characters it takes to make

00:19:49,390 --> 00:20:00,110
a letter. So, knitting and crocheting and weaving and stitching and embroidery goes

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:07,380
much farther than just messages and punch cards. There's some beautiful mathematical

00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:15,020
things that we can do with crocheting, for instance. So, look at the middle picture.

00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:22,521
The top one has two parallel lines. This is what we know as parallel lines. They are two

00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:29,980
straight lines that will never cross. But in hyperbolic knitting, all three of those

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:37,930
intersecting lines on the top are parallel to the line below it. And when this woman,

00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:48,460
Daina , asked, how? Why? Her teacher said, imagine it. Because we can't show you. And

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:55,900
it wasn't until 20 years later when she had to teach hyperbolic physics and geometry that

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,500
she really looked deeply and discovered that it was a crocheting pattern she was looking

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:08,490
at. So, she started crocheting and playing with it a bit and this is what we came up

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,620
with. This is one of the first versions and this is what she took to her students and

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:18,840
said, look, if you fold along these lines. They never intersect. It's not that these

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,720
are straight lines. It's that they are straight on the plane themselves. If you fold it into

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,280
a straight line, that's what they are. But if you look at them in comparison to the line

00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:39,110
below it, they suffer so that they never touch. They curve into each other and out. It wasn't

00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:47,760
until 1990s that we were able to actually visualize hyperbolic geometry. Because crocheting

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:55,660
is the only form of fabric that actually allows us to play with it and interact with it and

00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:06,100
see it for the first time. Another version of this is the Lorenz Manifold. Though the

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:13,700
hyperbolic geometry was the first time a crocheting pattern was printed in a scientific journal,

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,940
this was the second only a few years later. All right. So, this is a simplified model

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,820
of equations describing the rising and cooling of hot air. Otherwise known as thermal convection

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:34,980
in the atmosphere. But this is the only way that we have been able to determine that we

00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,799
can visualize these things. That we can play with them and move them and swirl them and

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:52,419
see them in a way that's stable. And in this sense, these fiber arts, these things that

00:22:52,419 --> 00:23:04,460
old women knit while nobody paid attention to them, were the ways to discover mathematics.

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,200
Something that a lot of people are really familiar with because we wear them a lot these

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,260
days is infinity columns. They're Moebius strips. But something we have a lot of difficulty

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:23,871
interacting with it w is a Klein bottle, which is a three dimensional Moebius strip. Every

00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:29,340
side is the outside. Every side is the inside. You can put your finger on one spot and wrap

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:39,380
all the way around and touch every surface without lifting. Without folding into an inside.

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:49,270
And beyond mathematics, we also have data visualization. There's something impactful

00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:57,030
about having color and texture in front of you like this. This scarf is not actually

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:05,039
every day and one year. It's one day for a hundred years. This is defining what global

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:13,550
warming looks like over time. In another one, they decided to map their sleep patterns of

00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:19,809
their children. When they were babies. Their first year. And they can see how they went

00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:28,309
from very erratic and who knows when to something much more stable. And in the third one, a

00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:33,020
woman who really, really hated her commute some days and was loving it on others would

00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:39,840
knit different colors based on what the delay was that day. And that ended up selling on

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:55,049
eBay for $8600. Right? And sometimes the art itself can be the technology. All right? This

00:24:55,049 --> 00:25:06,250
is actually functioning pianos. Functioning keys. Functions sensor. And just touch and

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:11,720
gesture motion sensors. Or sometimes it's just a QR code to allow you to connect to

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:28,670
the Wi Fi. But my question at this point is, is knitting a programming language? How far

00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:34,380
have we really come with this? And if you look at knitting, there's really only these

00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:40,470
three stitches. Unlike crocheting there's hundreds, thousands. Same thing with embroidery.

00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,740
Knitting only has these three. May do them in different orders, may knit three together.

00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:53,620
But in the end, it's just a knit stitch. And the purl is an opposite side of a knit stitch

00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:01,169
so you're just doing it backwards. And a warn over is just a way to make space. Which is

00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:16,560
how I made this sweater. Knowing that, how many of you can read this? Okay. This is a

00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:30,150
full knitting language. This is  this is the  this is in fact us programming. We have

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,220
to figure out so many things in our heads. Like, how many multiples and then how many

00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:41,800
we have to add. We have asterisks, we have parentheses, we have two last stitches. And

00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:50,840
if you really, really look at this, you'll recognize that this is what it is. All we're

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,530
doing is we're saying, we have a couple  we have some stitches that we have to do before

00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:03,630
the loop starts. And then we have our loop. Or a do while in this case. Do purl one knit

00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:13,760
three where we have more than three stitches left. And then we purl one and two. So, though

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:23,640
this pattern actually shows how we knit every row, the entire project, including the entire

00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:50,820
brocade stitch, is on my GitHub repo. Let's see if this will let me do it. Nope. So, this

00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:59,400
is essentially how it works. So, if you take those stitches and we say we want 18 inches.

00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:07,299
And we knit 6 stitches per inch and we want our diamond brocade stitch, it prints out

00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:11,941
not only how many cast on stitches that fit within those eight stitches, plus one. But

00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:20,559
also every knit and purl that's in those repeats. So, we could either do this...

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:44,590
Or we could do that. So, I have one last quote for you. From a lovely woman named Linda Liukas.

00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:50,750
She has a really energetic TED Talk that's just magical. I highly recommend you watch

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,410
it. There's a link on the slides. And near the middle, she said and that's why no one

00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,740
recognized that when I was conjugating French or irregular verbs, I was actually practicing

00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,049
my pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting, I was actually

00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:09,831
following a sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that

00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:15,190
Bernard Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language between English and mathematics

00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:27,309
found its home inside a computer. I was a computer programmer. But nobody knew it. We

00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:38,090
went from an 18th century fashion fad in France all the way to mathematics and science and

00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:46,520
is knitting a programming language? I have two points that I wanted to make. One, is

00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,120
we all stand on the shoulders of giants. And just because your idea may not be absolutely

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,580
unique in every fashion, doesn't change the fact that it's yours and it's important and

00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:03,600
it should be heard. And the other is that sometimes you have to step away from the computer

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:13,970
and play with something to truly discover something unique. I'm Jen Luker. You can find

00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:20,270
me on Twitter. And if you want to know more information, I have quite a few. Please come

00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,960
talk to me. Thank you. [ Applause ]
