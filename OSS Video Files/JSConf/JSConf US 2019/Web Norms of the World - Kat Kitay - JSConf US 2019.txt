Title: Web Norms of the World - Kat Kitay - JSConf US 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-10
Playlist: JSConf US 2019
Description: 
	Flat, muted minimalism, vast fields of whitespace, millennial pink landing pages, and those corporate illustrations that all kind of look the same: the internet today, amirite? Actually, that's just "us". In the West, consumers and web developers have deep and long-held expectations of how the web should work and look that have gone largely unquestioned.

While the internet was born in the West, it is not owned by the West. In this talk, we'll take stock of our own biases and take a culturally relativistic look at the internet outside of our comfort zone. We'll explore questions like: Why are Japanese websites so information-dense? How does a script like Arabic, read right to left, affect web design? What languages and frameworks do (or can) programmers across the world use? I hope that attendees of this talk will walk away with a fresh perspective, widened view, and ideas for how to improve the web in the West and make it more inclusive.

	00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,680
I've been working in tech for a couple

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,960
years now as an engineer but previously

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,580
as a product manager but like a lot of

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,189
people my degree isn't in computer

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,170
science in the anthropology which is the

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,660
study of human societies and evolution

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,460
and I really like thinking about systems

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,369
of people and now I also really like

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,649
thinking about systems and programs and

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,440
I think that I really enjoy that a lot

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,559
of the talks today have are about like

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,850
user empathy and bringing that into our

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,260
technical process and I think

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,620
understanding people is the key to

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,870
building successful products and also to

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,969
architecting them the right way so this

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,940
talk is about the web norms of the world

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,110
and it's it's based on the premise that

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,090
websites and Technology are different

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,489
around the world and if you've traveled

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,350
to another continent on vacation you may

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,960
have experienced this when you try to

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,330
buy something look up an event go to a

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,950
museum or get train tickets and if

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,320
you're a multinational person this is

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,760
definitely no surprise to you and so I

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,650
just wanted to hop in and give it a

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,240
couple examples of how websites might

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,570
look and feel different in different

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,200
places so this is Rakuten which is the

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,790
top japanese ecommerce site it's it's

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,030
obviously a web site but there are some

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,710
differences first it's in Japanese

00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,130
there's a lot of navigation options at

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,900
the top there aren't many large

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,720
drop-down menus and there's a lot of

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,780
icons pair of these navigation items and

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,930
the product images all have text baked

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,090
into them and if we compare that to a

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,369
site like Amazon in the US there are

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,470
fewer navigation elements the product

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,960
categories are hidden under one big

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,090
hamburger menu there's no text in the

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,320
product images the text is generally

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,320
larger it's more spread out

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,799
another example train travel is really

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,210
popular in Europe it's super normal to

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,960
jump on a train to go for a quick

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,710
vacation

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,360
this is France's train portal they offer

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,119
hotel deals and I've noticed that

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,860
European

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,190
transit sites have adopted this like

00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,260
really friendly candy color bubble style

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,500
in their web design and I think it

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:24,430
reflects the like the popular consumer

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,170
nature of train travel so let's compare

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,840
it to Amtrak in the u.s. it's definitely

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,280
more serious in style there's less focus

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,099
on destinations there are no

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,440
destinations on their homepage I think

00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:39,310
maybe it's a little more consumer sorry

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,200
commuter focused so I've started to

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,319
wonder why these websites are different

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,930
and I keep coming back to my educational

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,459
background and studying culture I always

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,879
thought that they were clear right and

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,470
wrong ways to make a website but when

00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,040
you put it within an anthropological

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:59,760
lens there there isn't right it's it's

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,950
all within the context of each culture

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,390
and I think the the question is

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,549
analogous with asking why are people

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,540
around the world different it's which

00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:09,579
scientists have been trying to answer

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:14,410
for hundreds of years so I will try to

00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:17,829
do it in 30 minutes I've been told to

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,989
drink water so I think that the answer

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:22,569
is that technology is a mode of cultural

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:25,690
expression just like language or dancing

00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,760
music food architecture it includes

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,129
people's customs their lifestyles how

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,810
they orient themselves to the world and

00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:33,790
I think even our technical decisions the

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,599
ones we make every day from the

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:40,060
programming languages to the frameworks

00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,220
deb services to the design and colors we

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,410
choose are all driven by a combination

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,489
of social factors that are unique to

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:50,530
each of our own cultures so why is this

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,120
important to talk about why can't people

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,430
just figure it out for themselves right

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,709
like I'm familiar with the us's culture

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,139
i can build websites and products for

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,780
people in the US there's a butch reasons

00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:03,430
the first is that computer and Internet

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,280
technology is totally not really

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,470
globalized it's globalized better and

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,299
faster than any other technology and we

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,489
all rely on the same foundational

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,349
elements for building software like

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,359
operating systems programming languages

00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:18,100
open source projects you'll find react

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,560
developers in every core

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,350
of the world and global software

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,390
corporations have already become really

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,960
huge and multinational just look at

00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,780
Google and Facebook Amazon Web Services

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,820
people across the world use iPhones

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,590
develop Apple in California many people

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,790
use I've Android phones that are built

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:41,740
in China Japan and Korea and the world

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,470
is coming more online the digital the

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,750
digital divide refers to the gap between

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,320
people who have access to the Internet

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:53,610
and those who don't is shrinking so in

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,650
1990 the internet was not very popular

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,660
over the last couple decades it's grown

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,190
tremendously now there are three and a

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,620
half billion people with internet access

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,650
and that's only that's actually slightly

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,240
under half of the world's population

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:11,220
some researchers claim total Internet

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,450
adoption between 2030 and 2040 and

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,550
emerging economies are adopting the

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,620
internet at exponential rates like India

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,140
I mean even countries like Bangladesh

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,000
and Ghana which are small compared to

00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,410
India just in population have doubled

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,380
the number of Internet connected users

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,480
in the past couple years and this is

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,070
bringing new users an opportunity to

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,930
these countries to the Internet

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:36,880
it's creating more demand for developers

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:39,100
and services locally and globally in as

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,570
developers we benefit from having more

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,490
developers and being connected with each

00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,680
other around the world we can share code

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,650
we can learn from each other we go to

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,000
each other's conferences innovations

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,830
that are made in one part of the world

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,360
can make a big difference in another

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,940
part of the world and I think that well

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,130
localized software that really meets the

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,160
needs of people in each of these areas

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,800
will ultimately win so products that

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,050
don't meet meet users needs like having

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,760
offline support choosing but making a

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,690
smart choice between building a desktop

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,460
or mobile or not translating well will

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,770
cause the product and not connect with

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,720
local users and because the in it

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,690
because Internet companies are uniquely

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,060
able to like target new customers in

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,890
global markets I think all of us as

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,260
developers will need to learn how to

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,670
internationalize properly

00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,770
think about different cultures around

00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,600
the world and this includes things like

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:39,850
open-source software which already

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,320
totally globally shared I really like

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,690
this example this is the Twitter

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,540
chronological timeline example where

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,280
they switch the feed from time order to

00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,070
algorithmic I think it shows that

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,020
culture extends to how people want to

00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,330
use technology and how much trust they

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,470
have in it and the fact that they

00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,260
backtracked I think shows that

00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:05,050
ultimately software will have to bend to

00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:06,490
human culture and needs so how can we

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,160
make more culturally sensitive

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,600
technology I think we can start by

00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,750
understanding the like the different

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:17,110
factors that developers can consider

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,270
when building software the first one is

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,160
language so language is the core thing

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,460
we do every day it's how we talk to each

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,440
other it includes coding language

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,700
affects how we design websites it

00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,740
affects whether you can read the

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,490
technical docs for a new language or

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:36,010
framework you want to try the second are

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,200
cultural attitudes which are how much do

00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,820
people trust the Internet are they

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,980
willing to put their credit cards in on

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,720
to buy something online are they open to

00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,300
trying new things do they have

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,610
established customs already how much do

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,370
they care about like lots of rules in

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,170
order what are their lifestyles like and

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,920
how they integrated the internet and

00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:58,990
technology into it the next one is

00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,270
government policy so some countries

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:04,060
restrict the internet others enforce

00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,860
regulations to preserve privacy and

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,770
other countries don't protect their

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,450
internet freedoms enough and the final

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,980
one is Internet infrastructure so who is

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,560
on the Internet in the first place is

00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,510
the connectivity widespread is available

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,450
everywhere is it stable or as an

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:21,400
intermittent so I want to go through

00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,800
each one of these and provide lots of

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,840
examples and talk about how developers

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,990
around the world handle these different

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,150
factors so the first is that language

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,970
affects how user interface is designed

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,220
adults there are a lot of languages

00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:39,160
there are over 7,000 known languages

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,690
this is one of my favorite maps and each

00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,320
one of these languages has their own

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,329
writing systems

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,509
one example is Hangul which is the

00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:49,279
primary korean writing system and when

00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:51,290
you take all the Hangul characters and

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,529
put it into a unicode block you get a

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:59,180
block that's about 11,000 glyphs large

00:08:53,529 --> 00:09:01,310
so there's a lot of them and there's

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,290
challenges to using font faces with

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,209
thousands of characters it makes it

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,579
really expensive to design them which

00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:09,410
makes it expensive to license them this

00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:13,040
means that historically there have been

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:15,139
limited selection of the font faces that

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,899
are web-safe and common across devices

00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:19,880
and moreover the files containing these

00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:22,370
font faces are really huge they can

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,529
reach like 15 megabytes in size compared

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,470
to just like a Latin alphabet alphabet

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:29,810
font face which could be like 400 or 500

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,339
kilobytes and that can be a huge

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,220
deal-breaker especially if you're trying

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:36,279
to load these on mobile so these

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,199
limitations require clever workarounds

00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:42,199
one very common workaround is to display

00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:45,709
text and images this is a this is a

00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:47,750
Korean ecommerce site Gmarket in all the

00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:51,110
text on this website in the navigation

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,779
our images and our huge benefits to this

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,149
it moves faster you can ensure the

00:09:53,779 --> 00:10:00,440
quality the text rendering it's going to

00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:03,019
look the same across browsers one method

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,600
to natively render fonts is called sub

00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,850
setting this can speed it up so sub sets

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,500
are just like slices of a font file down

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:14,540
to just the characters you need to load

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:16,190
to show the characters on the page there

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,740
are some really cool solutions out there

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,319
a group of Korean designers and

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,569
developers added Korean fonts to the

00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:26,180
google fonts project it uses machine

00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:28,730
learning driven sub setting to group

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,130
commonly seen characters together to

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,529
reduce load times and when it's served

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,870
over the google fonts API if benefits

00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:38,060
from cross-site caching so a user would

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:41,529
only need to load the font once in order

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,529
to see it across many web sites

00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:51,800
okay so there's there's other languages

00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:54,019
like Arabic and Hebrew they're read from

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,949
right to left and these require flipped

00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:59,329
layouts that are called bi-directional

00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:01,459
so anything that naturally goes on the

00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:04,339
left in English like on the television

00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:08,569
music art website when it's translated

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:10,579
into Hebrew would be totally mirror and

00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:14,839
everything has to be mirrored down to

00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:16,189
the navigation there are some CSS

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,009
frameworks that can be used to achieve

00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:21,799
this like right-to-left CSS this will

00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:24,199
automatically flip any directional CSS

00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,149
property so like border left or margin

00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:28,999
right would be automatically flipped and

00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:33,279
but you can also specify like manual

00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:35,629
processors to do this the next is that

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,399
text text also takes up a different

00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,899
matter of space when you translate it

00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,839
and I think that this could contribute

00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,670
to some interpretations of like

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,579
non-english language web sites is maybe

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,749
cluttered or busy I see that on the web

00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,699
but really I think it's a difference in

00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:52,850
writing system and a lack of familiarity

00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:54,649
and so the word views is actually three

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:58,069
times longer in Italian than it is in

00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:00,920
English and just in my own informal test

00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:05,379
this Thai translation of programming is

00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,819
very fun and cool is 1.7 times the space

00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:09,949
so if you're good to localize your

00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:12,230
project it has to go further than

00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:14,269
translating strings you can't translate

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,889
your translate your English site to

00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:18,559
Arabic without building a bi-directional

00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:20,779
layout and you have to account for the

00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,559
expansion and contraction of text when

00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:26,660
you translate it as well

00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,679
so we're building interfaces to support

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,049
different languages

00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:33,439
and but we know there are over 7,000 of

00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:35,720
them and the application programming we

00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:38,839
do like writing web apps in languages

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,720
like JavaScript all use abstractions in

00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:44,480
English terminology so all the reserved

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,309
words in JavaScript are English and this

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,980
is even the case for languages like Ruby

00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:50,990
which was invented in Japan and it was

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,850
five years between Ruby's invention and

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,269
the first English language book that was

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,269
published

00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,650
but if we look at the top spoken

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,810
languages in the world we can see how

00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,970
much of a disconnect there is right like

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,370
English is no more commonly spoken than

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:12,940
Hindi or really Arabic and much lesser

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:15,280
than Chinese click so what's happened is

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,610
that English has become a lingua franca

00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,010
or a common or trade language for

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:24,610
computing it's kind of similar to Latin

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,800
in the Roman Empire who conquered their

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,500
way around a spread Latin everywhere or

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,080
Italian and music theory and adopting

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,150
common languages both spoken languages

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,310
and programming languages does have a

00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:39,250
lot of benefits it makes it easier to

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,830
share code and communicate I don't have

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,300
to translate your piece of code into my

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,330
language in order to run it or

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,730
understand it and it makes it easier for

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,260
our work to be cumulative as developers

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,450
around the world and we can grow the

00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,480
entire pie in software rather than

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:59,830
developing technology in parallel

00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,820
specific to each language group so given

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,010
the prevalence of English and

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,920
programming and also in international

00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:07,510
trade and diplomacy it goes the English

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,310
is the most studied language in the

00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:14,290
world even though it's not the most

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:16,270
spoken language but also I think we can

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,660
also admit that code is not really

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,690
English

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:23,230
I don't know what a graph means but I do

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:25,300
know what it does I have been writing a

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,970
rough since I was like 12 and I don't

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,890
still don't know what it is so these

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,600
terms might be derived from English but

00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,730
you can code without learning to speak

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,030
it although you do have to become

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,800
familiar with the Latin alphabet I think

00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:42,970
I would describe code as a new dialect

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:46,030
of English in many ways some programming

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:49,060
tools skip English based code altogether

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:51,850
though this is scratch with which is a

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:55,420
block based programming tool developed

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,700
at MIT it's used by kids in schools and

00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,830
museums around the world about half of

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,350
the scratch users are out of the US and

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,330
Europe and the block abstraction makes

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,540
it really easy to translate each of

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,340
these logical blocks into and

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,130
foreign language and research done by

00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,110
MIT has shown that kids do learn how to

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:16,830
code faster when they use their native

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:19,410
language and also just because reserved

00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:22,140
words in in the programming language

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,420
languages we use are in English doesn't

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,460
mean they can't be replaced and so this

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,010
is a project called your lang which is a

00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,800
node like language in Yoruba which is a

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,000
language spoken in Nigeria and projects

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,070
like these I think could help

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,170
non-english speakers get into

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,810
programming in the beginning but I would

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:42,420
also love to see a future where were

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,870
able to inner translate languages like

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:47,040
these like I don't see why we couldn't

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,050
translate these reserved words back in

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,790
English or into any other language and

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:56,250
run it developers also want to read

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:59,100
documents documentation and debug issues

00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,080
in their native language so this is

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,480
especially important for developers who

00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,030
don't speak English translations

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,770
channels for discussing programming and

00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,950
computing in your native language

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,780
benefits everybody and it's great for

00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,790
non-english speaking developers it's

00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,480
actually critical and they are already

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:20,700
doing it but also by adding these kinds

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,830
of spaces and translations to

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,720
open-source projects can draw more

00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:27,300
developers into the project and make it

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,400
more inclusive and people find

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,830
translations so valuable that they will

00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,990
do it themselves Docs china is an

00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,510
aggregator of chinese translations of

00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,100
open-source projects which many of us

00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,100
were familiar with a lot of these in

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,470
this list I think this is really cool I

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,200
think that people are doing this for

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,280
every major language but there are some

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
problems with these unofficial

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,030
translations right there less

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,060
discoverable they're not attached to the

00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,950
main project website and there's more

00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:00,030
opportunity for them to grow stale as

00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:03,540
the base library changes and there are

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:06,690
ways to improve this right so the react

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:09,240
project has led a project to add

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:11,640
translations to their core documentation

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,280
I think doing that is a really good way

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,070
to recognize that you have an

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,160
international community and now Allison

00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:22,340
built a bot to open pull requests

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,510
in each translation whenever changes are

00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,090
made to the English Doc's

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,860
I know that this was inspired by the UJS

00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,140
team I think it's a really great

00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:34,040
strategy for keeping translations up to

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:37,250
date but also keeping it together in the

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,350
in the main project UJS also has a

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,080
discord server it includes native

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,940
language channels this gives folks an

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,040
entry point to find help and connect

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,660
with other devs from their area I also

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,000
know that there's a really strong view

00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,410
jeaious Japan user group and they have

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,320
their own slack channel organized

00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,900
translations of sort of ancillary vue.js

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,990
libraries and blog posts and community

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,150
events so incorporating those I think

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,460
can go a long way to making sure

00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:09,710
everybody is heard and included in your

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:12,020
project so cultural attitudes play a big

00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:14,120
role in how technology is used these are

00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,610
things these are the beliefs people have

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,040
their lifestyles their taboos what's

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:22,310
okay what's not okay and all the other

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,190
values that each culture holds and it's

00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,540
really hard to quantify anthropologists

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,000
and researchers have been trying to do

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,950
it for a long time there's a framework

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,120
called Hofstede's cultural dimensions

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:37,370
which is used in some marketing research

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,590
in e-commerce research it's not perfect

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,010
I really don't like the nurture versus

00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:44,840
power gendered dimension but I think it

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,760
can help think about how different

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,590
societies approach life overall

00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,390
so some societies might be more

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,280
comfortable with uncertain situations

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,080
some might be more focused on

00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,330
maintaining tradition others are more

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,760
future oriented some care about

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,730
collective success others on individual

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,490
success and it gives us a framework to

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,860
compare different nations cultures in a

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:10,010
more objective way or seemingly

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,510
objective way so for example Egypt Japan

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,390
and Russia all have really high

00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,550
uncertainty avoidance in this study

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,260
compared to the u.s. whereas the u.s. is

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,920
really highly indulgent in the

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,510
individualist um and I think that these

00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,460
kinds of differences show up in

00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,130
subconscious ways and the way that

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,380
technology and websites are built this

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,550
is a website for purchasing tickets for

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,430
the Ghibli Museum New York Tokyo

00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:38,160
it's a notoriously busy museum it's hard

00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:40,560
to look up it books out months in

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,500
advance and on tourist site it's really

00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,320
common to see all the information laid

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,990
out with step-by-step instructions with

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,880
screenshots on how to use the software

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,620
and all the information is spelled out

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,530
really clearly so even if you don't get

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,320
in you know why and let's compare it to

00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,630
the bird museum in LA and once you dig

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,920
into the site you realize if you don't

00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,050
buy a ticket you're gonna have to stand

00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,930
in line and you start to see all of this

00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:08,430
uncertain language like the chance of

00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:11,910
getting into this exhibit or the

00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,500
probability of seeing this this one so

00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,960
you don't actually know first if you can

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,400
get into the museum when you go and you

00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,230
don't know if you'll be able to see all

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,540
the exhibits and I don't know if this

00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:25,140
would fly in a country with high

00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:35,370
avoidance of uncertain situations and

00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:37,320
you get comments like faces it really

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:41,760
grows on you it takes a second you're

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:44,040
like okay I have an example personally

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,430
at my company ribbon I work on tools

00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:49,170
that help people purchase homes so the

00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,650
team designed and built this really

00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:54,930
elaborate sales funnel tracking tool it

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,690
was well spaced I think pretty well

00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:59,820
designed but the the users our team kept

00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,740
going back to Google sheets they kept

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,270
asking for like additional information

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,030
and we would say just click the name of

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,590
the buyer and go to the detail page so

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,960
but then they kept going back and like

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:13,740
doing all this data entry and eventually

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,050
we gave up we replaced it with this it's

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,780
an embedded spreadsheet from our bi tool

00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,070
called periscope and it turns out what

00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,350
they actually needed was something

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:25,050
really compact with no scrolling and

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,850
highly flexible so they can add any

00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:30,420
columns that they wanted without asking

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:32,030
us and so by throwing out what we

00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,200
thought was a really nice product and

00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:37,410
replacing it with their presumably worse

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,830
and uglier one actually better methods

00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,830
with the team

00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:45,080
another example on the cultural

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,660
dimension scale China is a very low

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,150
uncertainty avoidance country and really

00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,130
high on future orientation which means

00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:54,800
they're more willing to deal with

00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:57,230
ambiguity and very adaptable to changing

00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,420
technology for comparison the United

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,130
States scores very low on future

00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,970
orientation it's more stuck in

00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:07,010
preserving tradition and so we see that

00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,930
payments everywhere in China from Street

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:11,690
markets to taxis to restaurants are now

00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,970
being made through QR codes and payments

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,400
in an app called WeChat which is totally

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:19,010
ubiquitous for social networking and

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:23,120
payments it's an app that has a billion

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:25,310
users which is crazy this came about

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,950
years before we started to see this pop

00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:30,620
up in the US with companies like

00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:32,920
snapchat and venmo and we're really

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,320
starting to see China rapidly outpace

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,820
technological innovation in the u.s.

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,550
when this changes how you actually

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,230
launch startups and so Chinese startups

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,900
will start to make these light web apps

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,910
before they make desktop apps these are

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,520
meant to be accessed via QR codes and

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,080
load-in we chats browser so this is me

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,820
looking at it and recording it from my

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,110
desktop site and that's why there's a

00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,040
black bar on the right you're just not

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,980
supposed to look at it from your

00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,290
computer

00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,900
another final silly example of this just

00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:04,190
to bring it back home this is the Sunday

00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,860
comics

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,990
I love reading comics I think you get a

00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,210
good mix it's all really pretty and

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,070
brightly colored and compact and this is

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,890
what happens when you translate it to

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:19,400
the web without fully thinking through

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,500
how people might like to read comics and

00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,720
I think that it's missing a little bit

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:28,070
of the heart of how people want to read

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:30,170
comics so the third factor is that the

00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,450
Internet is not totally free all

00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,820
Internet infrastructure is ultimately

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:37,820
provided through private companies and

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,380
so it's subject to national laws one

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,810
example in recent history is China

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,670
blocking Google api's for us and

00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,800
developers to find mirrors and

00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,730
alternatives the latest status now is

00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,270
that they're being served through

00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:53,330
Beijing servers in Europe there's laws

00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:56,240
called gdpr which forces European sites

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:59,180
to ask for users consent to use cookies

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,850
and in South Korea there are strict

00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,100
regulations on online payments so for

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:07,640
years users have needed to use Internet

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,950
Explorer download ActiveX executable

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,080
files and manage local certificates to

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,030
authenticate desktop payments and this

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,470
is definitely changing

00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:19,280
but it has also pushed a lot of online

00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:20,870
payments to mobile and some kind of

00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,360
sometimes countries fight and levy

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,370
sanctions against each other just

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,650
recently an Iranian developer named

00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,660
Shaheen wrote this blog post about the

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,810
effects of the recent sanctions by the

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,520
US the sanctions brought down sites in

00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,190
these countries they restricted access

00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,560
to services like gitlab docker Android

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,620
dev it requires developers to use

00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:45,290
proxies and VPNs to bypass the sanctions

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:48,220
which is questionably illegal for these

00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,420
developers and dangerous for them to do

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:53,690
github has had to comply with the

00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,730
sanctions they restricted developers

00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,940
access to private repositories and

00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,170
gist's it was done so abruptly but these

00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,880
sanctions are painful for everybody

00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:04,220
nobody wants to break the law right and

00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,860
including github who would get in

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,500
trouble for not complying with them so

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,180
it's a really sticky situation a bunch

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,390
of devs banded together to make this

00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:16,400
github do not ban us repo and github did

00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,560
soften their restrictions and make it

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,310
easier to recover from but this is going

00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,350
to continue to be a problem and the the

00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,210
final category is Internet

00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:29,210
infrastructure it's very different

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,430
across the world so if we look at

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,190
desktop versus mobile across the world

00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:37,880
we can see that overall Africa and Asia

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:41,540
are much more heavy on mobile Internet

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,130
traffic in India 70% of visits visits

00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,650
were mobile to sites using the

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:48,050
StatCounter analytics tool and the u.s.

00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,400
it's more 50/50 so you can imagine that

00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,320
if you were launching a product in a

00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,120
place like India you would start with a

00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,710
mobile experience rather than a desktop

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,300
one and broadband access which is

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,730
defined as like high-speed stable

00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,890
Internet is also not equally distributed

00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,810
there's a really big gulf in broadband

00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,900
access between the developed and the

00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,150
developing

00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,280
developing worlds and people in rural

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:14,810
rural areas in every country also

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:17,520
frequently experienced low connectivity

00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:19,050
so there are projects from giants like

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,870
Google and Facebook trying to bring

00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,310
connectivity to these places - like

00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,680
varying degrees of success

00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,840
but also these countries are rapidly

00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,790
trying and doing a lot of work to build

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,930
in an infrastructure themselves that's

00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:35,900
the primary way people are coming online

00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:38,610
so places without stable internet

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,470
experience slower speeds and

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,390
intermittent connections that drop in

00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,790
and out this can make using apps and

00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:46,110
websites really frustrating so

00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,480
developers can improve the user

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:50,460
experience in these places by offering

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,980
offline support using techniques like

00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:56,160
local storage and service workers to

00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:59,100
cache to cache data locally and build

00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:02,520
progressive web apps to turn our web

00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:05,400
apps into seemingly native mobile apps

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,050
there's actually a talk here at the

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,110
conference on day two about this I'm

00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:12,230
really excited to go to that one this is

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,670
a screenshot of the Africa so Kony

00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:17,370
progressive web app it's a Kenyan online

00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:19,830
marketplace and so all you have to do is

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:22,410
hit share and add to homescreen and it

00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:24,810
becomes able to cache content locally

00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,930
and use service workers to keep that

00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:31,320
functional and while the connection is

00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,850
either stable or drops in and out these

00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,950
kinds of apps also take up less space

00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,740
the native apps which could be important

00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,260
for users that may have may be using

00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,480
budget phones and it's really well

00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,670
documented that companies that launch

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,200
these progressive web apps see huge

00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:51,720
gains and usage and conversion so that's

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,500
a really whirlwind tour of just a small

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,060
selection of the types of challenges and

00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,250
solutions that developers around the

00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,870
world are using really each of these

00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,730
categories could probably be their own

00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,830
dissertation I find it really

00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,780
fascinating but I also think that

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:09,810
there's ways we can apply this to our

00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:12,210
everyday work the first is that I don't

00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,760
think user empathy is just for product

00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:17,370
managers or designers we can use it to

00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,980
make the right technical decisions for

00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,990
the platforms we build for our products

00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,500
and for our open-source software we can

00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:27,660
use it also to localize to our own users

00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,669
and making sure we understand what our

00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,950
users needs really are like in the

00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:34,530
example with replacing our tool with a

00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,030
spreadsheet and if you know that your

00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:39,049
company will be expanding into new

00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:41,610
markets or already has users in

00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:43,830
international and other markets you can

00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,780
architect your application in a way to

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,299
reach those people in the way that

00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:50,280
they're most comfortable and I believe

00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:52,620
that the people who do this will win the

00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,600
will win the hearts of users and benefit

00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:58,380
the most from the growth of the Internet

00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:01,080
connected population we can also support

00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,120
our friends around the world we can

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,250
think about and include developers who

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,809
might not have the same access a lot of

00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,480
tech companies are based in San

00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:11,940
Francisco we can make translations a

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,010
priority we can work on if we if you

00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,049
work on developer services or open

00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:18,000
source projects I think you should look

00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:20,669
into some of the successful patterns we

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,040
talked about like building translations

00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:24,510
into your project and you can start

00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,370
small by linking to unofficial

00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,610
translations and starting to find

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:31,140
partners in the international community

00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:33,570
and finally I think sanctions and

00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,090
censorship are especially hard to fix as

00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,190
individuals but we can try to give we

00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,830
can give platforms to our friends who

00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,600
are affected by them and we can make

00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:45,510
noise and we can push companies with

00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:49,080
power like Microsoft who owns github to

00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:51,150
stand up against them and finally when

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,980
you come across a website or an app that

00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:56,190
isn't what you're used to whether it's

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,380
local or foreign try to think about the

00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:00,270
cultural context in which it was made

00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,309
this is a concept called cultural

00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:04,470
relativity it's a really core

00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:07,530
anthropological concept that helps you

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,870
stay objective and helps you avoid using

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:13,530
loaded terms to describe UI as like

00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:15,630
cluttered or text axes old when it may

00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:17,760
be a lack of context and understanding

00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:20,160
and we can use this to be more inclusive

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,720
and empathetic with each other and I

00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,490
think to build the right thing for

00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:28,200
people so I think we can embrace culture

00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,330
in our technical practice and remember

00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,880
that technology is really deeply

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,600
intertwined with culture and use it to

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,340
your advantage

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,890
so if you deeply understand who you're

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,720
building software for you and your

00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,480
software and the world will be better

00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,910
for it thank you so much

00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,150
[Applause]

00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,800
[Music]

00:30:44,150 --> 00:31:00,559
[Applause]

00:30:44,800 --> 00:31:00,559
