A Postmortem on the Ingen Incident

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,200
Hayley Denbraver KATIE: Hello.

00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,200
Come on in, sit down.

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,200
This is the last talk.

00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,200
Whoo!

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,200
All right.

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
So, our final presenter of the evening.

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
I think we're all really gonna love her presentation.

00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
It's Hayley Denbraver.

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
And she has been working as a consultant for Ingen and she's going to talk to us about

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,200
what she's learned.

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,200
now, Hayley's fun facts, actually, are kind of cool.

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Yesterday she did the node bots workshop and now says that she's completely and utterly

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,200
obsessed with building robots and wants to go home a build and a robot.

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Yeah.

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
She's got a competing thing, she's a knitter, I was in the other room, I'm bummed I missed

00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
it.

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
Has gotten her thinking about knitting.

00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
She can't decide what she wants to do, build a robot or just knit.

00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
And I think she should just build a robot that knits.

00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Yeah.

00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
All right.

00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,200
So, everyone, please give it up for our final speaker of JSConf US 2019, Hayley Denbraver.

00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
[ Applause ] HAYLEY: All right.

00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Can you guys hear me?

00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
Yeah.

00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
Great.

00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
So, evening.

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
We have a lot to get through.

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
And I need a sense of whether we have a quorum.

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,200
It does seem that the room is pretty full, so I'm gonna say we do.

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
So, welcome to this meeting for the board of the Ingen corporation held here at JSConf

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
US.

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
I have spoken to a few of you, but for others who I haven't met yet, my name is Hayley Denbraver

00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,570
and I've been hired to analyze the failures that occurred during the incident at IslaNublar.

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,579
There is maybe uncertainty about the project moving forward.

00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,250
And that's why I'm here.

00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,770
I was hired to review the recent incident and to catalog the points of failure and to

00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,620
suggest some next steps for the project.

00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:07,770
So, I'm going to talk to you today there's gonna be four parts, all right?

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,259
And first we're going to review the events of the weekend so we can all be working from

00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:15,070
the same set of facts.

00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,890
Second, I'm going to dive into the flaws within our design workflow.

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,380
Now, this isn't going to be about failures within the code itself, but it's more about

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,630
our process and our practice of software engineering.

00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,209
Third, we're going to discuss engineering ethics.

00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:43,799
And look into how ethical breaches compromised this project.

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,960
And finally, I'm going to cover the idea of chaos engineering.

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,929
And I'm going to suggest some steps that we could take to build a more resilient Jurassic

00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:58,700
Park.

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,999
I really want to be on the same page with everyone with respect to the events of the

00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:03,999
weekend.

00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,929
So, we're gonna do a quick review now.

00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:08,380
So, hands up.

00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,110
Can you tell me if you've read the written account of the failure at Jurassic Park?

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,110
All right.

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,040
I see a few hands.

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,580
That's good.

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,180
What about those who viewed the video footage?

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,180
Okay.

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,180
More.

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,180
That's good.

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,250
[ Laughter ] All right.

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,390
So, that helps.

00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,599
As those who are familiar with both can attest, there are a number of discrepancies between

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,009
the two accounts, all right?

00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:38,200
[ Laughter ] And from my research, it's clear to me that

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,580
the video footage provides the most accurate account so that's what we're gonna go with.

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:50,360
[ Laughter ] First, let痴 meet our consultants.

00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,270
Dr. Grant is a paleontologist.

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:58,850
And he works with his post doc, Dr. Sattler, a paleo botanist.

00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:05,890
Dr. Ian Malcolm has a Ph.D. in mathematics and he's an expert in something called chaos

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,500
theory.

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,310
He details this as the idea that systems are really complex.

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,780
And that they're likely to behave in unpredictable ways, even when small changes or flaws are

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,230
introduced.

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:27,720
Recent staff members include John Hammond, who is the creator of the park.

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,510
Dennis Nedry who was the lead software developer for Jurassic Park.

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,060
Dr. Woo, the head scientist.

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,499
Robert Muldoon who was our game warden.

00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:51,629
John Arnold who was our chief engineer and Donald Gennaro who was our chief counsel.

00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:53,349
All right.

00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:57,900
So, now that we know the team, let's discuss the events.

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,930
After a construction worker was killed in an accident, Grant, Sattler and Malcolm were

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,720
brought to the park to render their professional opinions.

00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,650
Malcolm was aware of the nature of the park and was against the project.

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,430
He was convinced that the park would never work because of chaos theory and we're gonna

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,680
discuss that more later.

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,930
Grant and Sattler were unaware of the true nature of the park.

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,160
They thought it was something more Akin to a museum.

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,020
But they were initially surprised and delighted by the dinosaurs.

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,120
While this visit was taking place, Dennis Nedry was on site to take care of software

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
bugs.

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,900
We have since learned that he was unhappy with the terms of his contract.

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,750
A while back he was approached by a competitor who wanted to open a similar park and wasn't

00:04:52,750 --> 00:05:00,360
above bribing Nedry to steal embryos to which he agreed.

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,060
There was a significant storm while some of our people were on a tour of the park.

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,910
A number of systems went down.

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,169
Some of the result of the storm.

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:16,970
And others because Nedry had purposely brought them down in order to execute his plan.

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,050
Most notably, the electric fences went down.

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,540
Nedry died while trying to get the embryos to his handler.

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:34,169
And was not able to look at the purposeful software vulnerabilities that he had included

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:43,080
to execute his plan, or the multitude of software bugs that were there anyway.

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,699
Grant discovered that some of the dinosaurs had been breeding.

00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,500
Even though this was supposed to be impossible.

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,259
Because we had made sure that all of the dinosaurs are female.

00:05:54,259 --> 00:06:02,599
Geneticist, Dr. Wu, used frog DNA to fill in the holes in the genetic code and apparently

00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:08,830
certain species of frogs can change sex when in a single sex environment in order to continue

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,490
the species.

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,610
Or as Malcolm puts it, life finds a way.

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,340
While Grant and others were evading raptors, Dr. Sattler with the help of Muldoon and Arnold

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,250
was able to manually reboot the power and Hammond's granddaughter was able to get the

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,680
computer up and running again because she knows UNIX.

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,190
[ Laughter ] This success this success came at a high

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:42,889
cost because both Muldoon and Arnold were lost in the effort.

00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:45,300
And they weren't the only ones.

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:53,500
During this incident, we lost Nedry, Muldoon, Arnold and Gennaro and we also lost the construction

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,330
worker previously.

00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,910
There were also many, many close calls.

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,389
God, we have a lot of hiring to do.

00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,069
Check the website, okay?

00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,909
[ Laughter ] The remaining team members with various injuries

00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:15,669
and traumas were able to escape once the storm had cleared and the T Rex and the velociraptors

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:22,520
were keeping each other busy and this brings the relevant facts to a close.

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Okay.

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,810
Now that we're on the same page, let's talk about software engineering at Jurassic Park.

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:36,139
John Hammond claims that he spared no expense in the creation of this park.

00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,870
But this really isn't the case.

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:45,780
The resort is luxurious, and yes, genetic engineering is pricey, but I determined through

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,620
my research that we dropped the ball when it comes to software.

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,949
We're going to look at the pitfalls.

00:07:52,949 --> 00:08:01,400
In this area, I am going to be nice to Nedry, but I have harsh words for him later.

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,590
From the evidence I've gathered, it's hard to believe this.

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:13,490
But it was clear that Nedry did not know that he was writing software for a dinosaur park.

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,319
Instead, I discovered that the requirements he had been given included vague instructions

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:26,300
like write software that will dispense food at prerecorded times.

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,770
Write software to monitor a series of electric fences.

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,770
Write software to visually scan the area and report back.

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,100
Nedry eventually figured out what the software was for.

00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,700
And he had his suspicions confirmed by our competitors.

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,260
But he should have been in from the first.

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,770
And if we didn't trust him to be in from the first, then we should have hired someone else

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,950
even if that would have cost more.

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,020
Hammond was trying to be competitive by keeping his plans under wraps.

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,670
But he was setting himself up for failure by not giving his software development team

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,690
critical information.

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,580
In addition to not telling Nedry what the software's for, an unrealistic timeline was

00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
enforced.

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,880
There was scope creep, insufficient budgeting.

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,960
For instance, Nedry tried to get more money to fix problems, but was threatened with retaliation.

00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,100
And when the scope creep in the budget is blown, how much testing do you think really

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:36,470
happens and what critical features do you think are deemed "Good enough"?

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:42,560
Now, don't get me wrong, all code has bugs and problems.

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,280
Everyone no one's perfect and everyone has their fair share of flaws.

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,410
And a project can always be improved.

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:58,030
But not perfect code is a far cry from poorly designed, poorly documented, untested code

00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,530
running in a production environment that includes velociraptors.

00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,730
All right.

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:12,170
So, it's clear that we didn't approach how the design of Jurassic Park in a way to best

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,330
ensure the success and safety of the project.

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:21,850
But I also want to discuss the breaches in ethical practice that occurred because they're

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,790
undoubtedly a cause of the problem as well.

00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,120
So, who here has heard of the Hippocratic oath?

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,240
Lots of people.

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Okay.

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
Good.

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
It's a pledge doctors give.

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,460
And it says to first, do no harm.

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:46,850
So, who here has heard of doctors, lawyers, or engineers and when I say engineers here,

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,930
I mean like a structural engineer, a mechanical engineer, someone who is licensed who here

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:59,500
has heard of someone like that either losing their license or being fined or prosecuted

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,790
for unethical behavior.

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,930
That happens too.

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:10,210
The reason that happens is doctors and lawyers and engineers are accountable for their professional

00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:15,480
behavior in order to protect the people that they serve.

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,510
Certain aspects of the design and conception of Jurassic Park, and even specifically to

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,830
the software, it cost a lot of harmed to the public.

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,000
And it should be viewed as a failing and unethical practice.

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,500
Whether this means we'll be held into account or not remains to be seen.

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,210
Nedry is clearly guilty of unethical behavior.

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,820
He introduced flaws into his system to exploit for his own personal gain.

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,560
He accepted bribes to steal another's property.

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,000
He purposely wrote code so that it would be difficult for someone else to debug it and

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,140
reboot it and expose his malfeasance.

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:09,180
What he did was illegal, immoral, unethical, and directly led to the deaths of himself

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,660
and others.

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,740
And I think it would be easy to focus on Nedry.

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,500
And his short comings because he's a contractor.

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,690
And he's not part of our main org chart, right?

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,510
And he's also dead.

00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,820
[ Laughter ] But I can't let Ingen and its representatives

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,980
off the hook either.

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,410
If we think of breaches in engineering ethics to only include things like sabotage and bribery,

00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,080
we miss the larger picture.

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:49,260
Malcolm, our infuriating and unapologetic consultant was right.

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:56,470
We thought about whether we could create this park, and we never considered whether we should.

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,110
Malcolm was of the opinion that the park could never be safe.

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:07,070
And while we could debate the merit of that position, it's clear that the potential for

00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:13,770
harm was much higher than originally portrayed by some of our higher ups.

00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:20,220
In the interest of financial gain, corners were cut which resulted in decreased safety

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,730
and that's unacceptable.

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,470
Ethical breaches have consequences.

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,800
And in our case, it resulted in a handful of deaths.

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,010
Some other injuries and traumas.

00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,350
And financial loss to a number of parties.

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,630
And it could have been a lot worse.

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:48,890
I mentioned at the start that I have an interest in engineering ethics.

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,830
And this is true.

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,310
And I could tell you that it comes from me being just a really excellent person.

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,330
But that's not the case.

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:04,400
If I put my business hat on, I still care about this stuff.

00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:13,050
And the reason is that I'm interested in engineering ethics because I am interested in resilient

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,420
software systems.

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,070
Ethical breaches have the capacity to compromise a system.

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:26,330
And that's precisely what happened in this case with respect to Nedry and with respect

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,400
to Ingen.

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,580
Ethical breaches are a source of chaos.

00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:36,490
They are unexpected and their results are unpredictable.

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,790
Training in and the application of engineering ethics should never be considered what our

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,420
industry sometimes calls soft skills.

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,990
But rather they should be viewed as something that has the capacity to make or break your

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,540
system.

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,130
My final point of discussion is about chaos engineering.

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:05,870
As we've seen, Ingen system experienced a high degree of chaos in the form of unethical

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,350
behavior, fraudulent system design and simple bad luck.

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,990
The storm compounded problems, for instance.

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,990
If the board besides to move forward with rebuilding and reinvesting in the park, I

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,690
believe that chaos engineering should be deployed as part of the system.

00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,550
But what is chaos engineering?

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:33,130
Well, chaos engineering is the practice of breaking your system on purpose.

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,910
Observing how the failure propagates through the system and documenting how the team was

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:43,330
able to respond to the problem and then refactoring to fix that.

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:50,420
This is what happened on Isla Nublar, but minus the on purpose part.

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,740
How do we approach this?

00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:01,440
First recommendation, break things on purpose, but don't start with production.

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,790
Break a Dev instance.

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,240
See what happens and how your team responds.

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,600
Release a hypothetical velociraptor before you release a real one.

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:20,000
And that doesn't mean that you can't move to prod eventually, but let's start with Dev.

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,410
Second recommendation is to start small and iterate.

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:30,840
Break something small, make a prediction of what will happen, see what actually does,

00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:36,690
resolve the incident and then refactor to prevent the propagation of the failure that

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,540
was observed.

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,840
Then break something else and repeat.

00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,870
Train your staff on incident response so they're not scrambling to figure out how to turn on

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:53,300
the generator or, say, how to reboot the electric fence.

00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,370
A final point to provide perspective.

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,370
Another term for chaos engineering is failure injection.

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,250
It might be weird to think of something that includes the word "Failure" as a positive

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,250
thing.

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,500
So, if that trips you up, I would say that you should focus on the word" Injection" and

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,089
think of chaos engineering as a vaccine.

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:27,850
Whether it's dead or virus,software bug is injected into a healthy system.

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:34,740
It addresses the issue and retains the ability to address the problem when it's encountered

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,039
another time.

00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:41,400
It becomes stronger by being exposed.

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:49,320
Upon reviews the events, it became very important to me to talk both about engineer ethics and

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
about chaos.

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,610
I really think that these ideas reinforce each other, especially for systems that are

00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,610
critical.

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,679
It could be argued that we have an ethical responsibility to build resilient systems,

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,549
especially when the human cost of failure is high.

00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:11,610
Additionally, the ethical practice of software engineering, well, it removes an element of

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,940
chaos from the system.

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,650
Things may still go wrong.

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,570
But from mistake and not malice.

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:27,309
It's my opinion that any further progress on Jurassic Park should go forward with these

00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:32,600
two ideas as its base or it shouldn't go forward at all.

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,790
So, how do we use these ideas to build a better park?

00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:42,210
I want to close my talk with the following recommendations.

00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:51,889
Recommendation one: Appropriately budget resources to software design and testing.

00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:56,299
Number two: Increase transparency between stakeholders.

00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:58,540
No surprises.

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,950
Three: Hire professionals you can trust.

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,179
Listen to them and make sure they have the necessary resources.

00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,700
And hire enough people.

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,330
Don't discount your staff.

00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:15,980
Jurassic Park had initially been designed to not require a lot of people.

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,760
But better software or automated software doesn't negate your need for well trained,

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,909
capable staff.

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:33,679
Number four: To build a better park, use the principles of chaos engineering to refine

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,120
your design well before there are actual velociraptors running around.

00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,350
And finally, number five.

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,289
Maybe just don't.

00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:46,549
Yeah, maybe just don't.

00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:50,630
As Malcolm puts it, this park might have been doomed from the start.

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,150
The stakes are too high and nature is just too complex.

00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,840
Ask yourself whether you should, not just whether you can.

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,900
All right.

00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,760
So, it's time to call the question.

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,440
Who here on the board votes to restart and reinvest in Jurassic Park?

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,330
I want to see a show of hands.

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,399
Yeah?

00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,470
Okay.

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,620
And how many want to kill the project?

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,749
Show of hands?

00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:22,749
Okay.

00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:24,440
The lights are kind of strong.

00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,559
So, I may be wrong here.

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,480
But I feel like the majority want to reinvest.

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,840
So so, the project is restarted.

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,600
And may God have mercy.

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,860
[ Laughter ] [ Applause ]

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,110
There's more.

00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:54,009
Now, if you'll allow me a minute, I would really like to address you as myself and not

00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:55,009
in character.

00:20:55,009 --> 00:21:00,409
So, thank you so much to the JSConf US team for having me and my talk for this conference.

00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:02,500
It was a real pleasure.

00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,700
My real job, I don't actually work for Ingen, is as a developer advocate at Snyk.

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,270
And I get feedback from Devs and learn about the challenges that they face and to help

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,270
them out.

00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,850
So, if you ever want to talk open source and security, please don't hesitate to drop me

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,850
a line.

00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,639
You can see my email onthis screen and my Twitter handle is there too.

00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:28,190
And I would love to hear from you.

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:33,909
I'll also be posting these slides at that Twitter handle as soon as I can so you can

00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,809
check that out if you're interested.

00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:39,879
And I'll probably drop a link in the Slack as well.

00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:46,559
And if you're interested in learning more about security, you can join a vendor neutral

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,460
security education focused group that I help run called the secure developer.

00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,450
We do virtual events and we have a Slack group.

00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,419
And there's also a podcast that I think is really good.

00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:01,039
So, check that out if you're interested.

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,340
And I wanted to do one more thing.

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,500
And because I was so excited to give this talk and because I'm a local and I didn't

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:18,460
have to drag a bunch of stuff through the airport, we're gonna do some trivia.

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,690
And it includes some prizes for those that get the answers right.

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,520
So, in 1993 I was in elementary school.

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,259
And we were ignored if we spoke without raising our hands and being called on.

00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:35,559
So, that's how I'm gonna operate here.

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,700
And you have been warned.

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,200
Additionally, this is 1993, so, you wouldn't be able to Google stuff and you definitely

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,519
wouldn't have a phone that connects to the Internet.

00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,179
Play fair, all right?

00:22:50,179 --> 00:23:00,240
So, our first question is: What had Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler discovered at their dig site

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,470
at the opening of the movie?

00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,370
Any hands?

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,269
Front table.

00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:07,269
Nope.

00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,330
That's not it.

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,159
Red hat.

00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:18,389
AUDIENCE: [ Away from microphone ] HAYLEY: That is close enough.

00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:22,360
It was a velociraptor fossil of a baby velociraptor.

00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:28,679
Come get your prize.

00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,029
It was an infant velociraptor fossil.

00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:33,620
Yeah, you're welcome.

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,350
All right.

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:42,980
So, a retro fitted can of shaving cream is used by Nedry oh, see, I don't pay attention

00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,779
when people don't raise their hands and are called on.

00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:46,940
All right.

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,669
So, what brand is it?

00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:49,990
Hands, please?

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,980
Um let's see.

00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,690
A guy in the gray sweater.

00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,769
In the middle.

00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,769
Barbasol.

00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,639
That's right.

00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,740
Come claim your prize.

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,330
Yay!

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,509
All right.

00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:07,610
This one I really like.

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,320
And I want to see hands, not yelling.

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,639
So, which of the following is a dinosaur?

00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:19,690
Um let's see.

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,220
Let's go with the girl I think she's wearing red.

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,769
Did you raise your hand tentatively?

00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:27,769
Yeah.

00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:31,860
Which one is a dinosaur?

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,039
Which one do you mean?

00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:40,700
So, the the one that's flying?

00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,309
Or which one?

00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:46,309
The what?

00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:48,720
AUDIENCE: [ Away from microphone ] HAYLEY: The flying one.

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
No.

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,409
That is not a dinosaur.

00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:52,970
Down front, here.

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,179
The penguin is a dinosaur.

00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:56,179
No, really.

00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:58,980
I read this in a book.

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:06,730
So the pterodactyl was a really good guess and co existed with the dinosaurs, but it

00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,200
was really a flying lizard.

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:17,429
Whereas the general scientific consensus right now is that birds are not only related to

00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:20,350
dinosaurs, but they're a branch of dinosaurs.

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:25,309
And so, people will sometimes call them avian dinosaurs and they're still here today.

00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:41,610
And finally, the fictional island of Isla Nublar is located off the coast of what country?

Thanks again to all the organizers and especially for how inclusive and thoughtful they were

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,100

00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,490
I had no idea.

00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,490
