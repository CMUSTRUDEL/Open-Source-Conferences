Title: Staying confident without feeling like an imposter - David Whittaker - JSConf US 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-12
Playlist: JSConf US 2019
Description: 
	I often worry that my colleagues are smarter than me and one day they'll discover how incompetent I really am. I try to learn everything I can and keep up with the latest technology, but is it enough? They always seem to know more. Why do I always fear my success is dependent on my ranking against others?

In this talk, we'll explore techniques I've found to build confidence as a developer. We'll discuss how to honestly inventory our skills, reframe goals, and take an authentic look at our own journey. Our increased confidence will let us escape the alluring imposter syndrome sinkhole and liberate us to maximize our contribution.

All right, thanks everyone.

00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,399
So as Katie said I'm David Whittaker and I spent about half my career teaching math,

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,500
which is something that made me think about confidence quite a bit and the other half

00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,380
writing software and right now I work at Qualcomm and I'm a program manager and developer and

00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,380
work on Node, Xpress, JS, that kind of stuff.

00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,269
So let's talk about what we're going to cover today.

00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:13,019
So I want to cover three main points.

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,970
First, you are not an imposter.

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,810
Second, feelings are not facts.

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,830
And third, I want to get over and break out of that self-doubt infinite loop.

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,030
So let's talk about some ways to do that.

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,370
Over four years ago, I was thinking about these thoughts, wondering what's happening

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:46,370
in my field, and where I fit in, and why I felt this way and so I made this really crude

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:52,160
diagram and it's not even aligned properly, but I just did it to help me understand my

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,129
own thoughts and it got a lot of traction and when Wil Wheaton retweeted it, I thought

00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,300
I'd made it in the world.

00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,090
I'm done.

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:10,200
So I kind of want to unpack this a little bit more, especially in the tech world, because

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,270
as we learn what's out there and the frameworks that are available and the new technology,

00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,890
we know that the things that we don't know starts to get larger and larger.

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,500
And what I hope you'll leave with is it's the intersections of the things that you do

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,140
know and don't know, your inner perspective that brings you value.

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,310
Researchers tell us that about 70% of folks feel this way and I'd venture to guess that

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:47,450
in the tech world it's probably a lot more, because we're surrounded by smart people and

00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,560
we are constantly bombarded with new thoughts and new ideas.

00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,030
So let's look a little bit differently.

00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,750
I like to think of confidence as on a spectrum and any given day we'll move back and forth

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,780
on this spectrum, depending on where we are in our lives and in our career.

00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,960
So on the left here we have the, you know, very low confidence, my work's never good

00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,500
enough.

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,030
Everyone knows more than I do.

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,420
I don't belong.

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,120
And on the right, we have the really high, maybe overly confident person, who's always

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,890
perfect and thinks they're smarter than everyone, and they should be the one in charge.

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,560
Now I want to talk about what reality is.

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:39,219
So the real competence, so if we have a mismatch here between the way -- the way you feel about

00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:45,909
the world, your confidence in your work, and your actual competence, then there's a danger

00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:51,040
here of what we're calling Imposter Syndrome.

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,019
Of course there could be a mismatch in the other connection, which is the Dunning Kruger

00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,469
effect, where you're really highly confident but not really highly competent.

00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:07,040
So today we're going to talk about this particular mismatch, where you have a low confidence

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,109
going into something, but really you are very competent, which I venture to guess most of

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,930
you are.

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,560
So some signs that we see here, you know, downplaying accomplishments, you're feeling

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,090
that everything you're doing that is successful is luck, you're not sure if you're good enough

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:32,540
to work here, everyone seems really smarter than me, this could all lead to some negative

00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,730
impacts.

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:39,889
Your work suffers, you may even suffer physical things, like ulcers, back pain, migraines,

00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:50,269
anxiety, relationship issues, all because of this fear and anxiety.

00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:57,340
In 2011 Dr. Valerie Young, talked about five confidence types which I like to call personas

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,430
that kind of embody the different ways that Imposter Syndrome can manifest itself.

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,139
The first way we see here is this perfectionist.

00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,360
Someone who sets extremely high expectations for themselves impossible to reach, and every

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,290
time they make a small mistake, they question their own competence.

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,330
The expert, someone who feels like they have to know everything complete all the details

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,291
before they'll even start a project, apply for a job or do anything, they're afraid to

00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:34,940
ask questions, even, because asking questions might reveal a bit of their own incompetence.

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,910
The natural genius when they grow up, things came easy, so when things don't come easy,

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:47,830
feel like they are a failure, the soloist must do everything on their own and if I have

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:56,140
to ask for help, I'm not confident and finally the super human who feels like I really have

00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,940
to compensate for my incompetence by working really hard around the clock.

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,400
So which one of these do you most relate to?

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,640
This is me.

00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,810
At least at some point and I kind of move back and forth between these things.

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,620
So I want to talk a little bit about bias.

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:25,930
And bias is a lot like a colored lens that changes the inputs that we get from the real

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,230
world, and stores them in our brain in a different way than we actually received them.

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,250
But we don't know this happens.

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:39,490
And you see that red dot, the congruent belief, is something that is already consistent with

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,660
our current belief system, our current feelings.

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,660
That is fast-tracked right to the right, right into the brain, yes, I knew that was correct,

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,910
goes right over there.

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,300
The other ones take a little bit more time and when we get a congruent belief that makes

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,900
our belief system even bigger, even stronger.

00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,490
This is called confirmation bias.

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,890
We'll even look for things that are consistent with our current beliefs.

00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:11,940
And the confirmation bias will also take contradictory beliefs and just reject them completely.

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,460
We won't even bring them in as a proper input.

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:24,260
So I like this cartoon, it says, I love your work: Oh, they're family, they're supposed

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,820
to say that, oh, they're friends they have to say that, they're strangers, they have

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,820
to say that.

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:36,050
And when I saw this tweet, I like to read the comments and one person said, oh, you

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:45,560
missed a frame and so they created this frame.

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,710
This is confirmation bias, both sides of it, and really like their response.

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:58,310
So to compensate for this, what I want you to do is create a positive feedback board.

00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,961
So any time you get some positive feedback, I know it may not register correctly, write

00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:05,250
it down.

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,970
Put it on your wall, and just save it there for later.

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,420
You shouldn't expect other people to write these notes for you, but write them for yourself.

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,930
Just write your note, you did a great job on that project.

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,932
It doesn't how you feel about it on that point, just write it on your wall.

00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:28,330
The next time you need a boost of confidence, look at your positive feedback board.

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,150
Next I want to talk about self-doubt.

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,590
Now, if you've ever seen the awkward Yeti, you'll note that all of their cartoons have

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,650
a brain and a heart.

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:44,970
So the brain is saying to the heart the feelings: Maybe it would be easier if we put this down.

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:51,490
So what I want to kind of talk about is that this self-doubt becomes this coping mechanism

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,550
that helps us deal with the fact that we may not be able to live up to this high standard

00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,420
that we've set for ourselves.

00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:06,750
And let's go through what happens with someone that has maybe a lower confidence.

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,060
First they're going to have some uneasy feeling.

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,240
They'll start to question themselves.

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,110
You know, I don't know what I'm doing here.

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,110
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,110
Do I belong?

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,230
I'm really not as smart as everyone else.

00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,610
And that leads to this negative internal talk.

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,400
I'm not -- I'm an imposter, I'm probably going to fail at this.

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,810
I'm not good enough, I shouldn't even start, because I can't even do it right.

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:40,709
And even if the event leads to success, the success is discounted as luck.

00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:47,569
And if there's failure, well, then the loop starts over again.

00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:53,040
But let's look at someone with higher confidence, yes, they have self-doubt, yes they have uneasy

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,680
feelings and yes, they question themselves.

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,700
But here's how the difference happens: How they respond to this self-questioning.

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,050
This self-questioning is the key.

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,240
It means wait, I need to pay attention here.

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,430
It means something is wrong.

00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:14,560
What can I do about it and what I do is I see this as an opportunity to learn.

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,819
I have a growth mind set.

00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:21,329
I view this as a challenge, something that I can take on, I'm going to start researching,

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:24,000
gather evidence, ask questions.

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,110
I'm going to look at maybe there's a bias here and I'm going to try to break that bias,

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,199
I'm going to try to create some goals thinking maybe there's something I can do better here

00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:38,230
and try to do it better next time.

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,199
They're OK with failure.

00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:44,680
If you think about 0 us in the software world we always talk about fail fast.

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,980
They know if they fail fast, they'll learn from that opportunity and iterate and do it

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,759
better next time.

00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,250
And if they do have success, they take it on, they accept it, they own it, they know

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:03,490
that this is something I did and they allow themselves to increase their own self-esteem

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,240
and their confidence will grow.

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,329
So very similar concepts.

00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:15,800
A couple weeks ago, I was talking to a sky diver and there's no way I could ever do this.

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,649
If I ever saw land like that, there's no way, way too scared.

00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,889
Falling is -- afraid of heights, afraid of falling, there's no way I could do this.

00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:30,660
And what he said in response to that really stuck with me.

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:37,730
It's not that I no longer have fear, I just know how to manage it better.

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,529
That's the same with highly confident folks.

00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:46,040
They still have fear, they just know how to manage it better.

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:53,610
So what I've done to help us move from maybe a lower confidence to a higher confidence,

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,870
is to create a growth mind set worksheet.

00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,839
This is just some of the questions that you'll see on the worksheet.

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,470
This will help you journal and write about your thoughts and feelings.

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,420
Questions about what do you think is going to go well?

00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,430
What do you think will go well?

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,529
How have you prepared yourself for this?

00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,720
And there's a before something happens and an after something happens part of this journal.

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,819
You know, we used to say when we were a kid, I can draw, I can draw, give me a piece of

00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:29,199
paper and then as we start learning about masterpieces and the complexity of art and

00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,620
brushes and things like that, we start to say, well, I can't draw.

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,000
I can't draw.

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,180
But it's not that we can't draw.

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,800
You can draw if you want to.

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,950
It's just you need to practice, right?

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,149
So the right answer is, I can't draw well right now.

00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,720
But I could if I wanted to.

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,410
And hopefully as you work through these things, you'll be more confident to deal with whatever

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,439
comes your way.

00:11:54,439 --> 00:12:00,550
Tim Doherty this morning said concrete failure is better than just some unknown sense of

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,189
failure and I think that's what this worksheet does.

00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,579
His talk was TDD.

00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:12,629
That I know what the tests are, they're failing, I know what I need to fix.

00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:13,980
Same here.

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,610
We have this unknown sense of failure, I don't know why, but I need to feel comfortable here.

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:26,519
This helps you understand your thoughts and really understand why you feel this way.

00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,670
If you're an imposter.

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:35,089
No you're not, if you're an individual contributor, tell your imposter story.

00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,740
This doesn't have to be on the channel here, but we do have a Slack channel during the

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,470
conference, tell somebody you're familiar with, tell them you're working through this

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,300
worksheet and you need their help.

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:54,550
Make sure you understand where your bias is, where your confirmation bias may be.

00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,619
And of course, having a growth mind set is important, understanding that you can fail,

00:12:58,619 --> 00:12:59,619
that's OK.

00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:01,910
You can iterate.

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,910
And ask questions.

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,240
You know, not everyone is good at communicating knowledge.

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,820
And so it's important that you ask questions, asking questions is an important way to learn.

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,319
I mean think about little kids.

00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:17,209
That's all they do is ask questions.

00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:24,480
Understanding that you have to embrace this feeling of not knowing, and see it as an opportunity

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,810
to grow.

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,120
As we mentioned, keeping that positive feedback board, and own your successes.

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,660
These are yours.

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,089
I think it's important to also compliment other people.

00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,629
When you see people that do know something more than you do, tell them I really admire

00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:43,300
how much you know about that.

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,459
Can I learn from you?

00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:48,370
And I think it's important for you to mentor others.

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,290
I've been a big brother in the Big Brother/Big Sister system, and I think that's extremely

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,040
valuable.

00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,079
And then finally, as I kind of mentioned back when we did the tweet, define your unique

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,899
perspective, what is it about you, about your background, the things you know, your unique

00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:15,570
combination of things that gives you value.

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,749
And if there are any leaders in this room I want to just mention a couple more points.

00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:27,529
Tell your imposter story, especially to your directs, bounce credit back, don't take it

00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:34,559
from your direct reports, make sure that you tell them that you appreciate their work.

00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:40,119
And from time to time tell them exactly what it is that you appreciate that they bring

00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:41,119
to the team.

00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:47,100
Their expertise, ability to follow through, their motivation, or organization skills,

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,980
whatever it is, make sure you tell them because they're probably going to write it down on

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,350
a post-it note and put it on their board.

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,420
So let's see what we covered, you are not an imposter.

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:05,639
Feelings are not facts, and break out of this self-doubt loop.

00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,930
And I have some resources here for you if you're interested in getting the slides later.

00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,930
Thank you.

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:10,931
