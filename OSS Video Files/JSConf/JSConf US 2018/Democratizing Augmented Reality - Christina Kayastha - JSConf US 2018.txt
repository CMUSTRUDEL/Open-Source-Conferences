00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,669
hi guys

00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,110
I hope you've had a great conference I'm

00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:31,419
really excited to be speaking to you

00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:35,500
today my clicker is not clicking so I'm

00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:38,170
gonna use this okay so hello world I'm

00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,910
Christian by day I'm a software engineer

00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,800
I work at Vistaprint in the Greater

00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:45,790
Boston area I have a bunch of my

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,970
colleagues here by night I am a total

00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,680
nerd I love hanging out at meetups going

00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,110
to hackathons and checking out the

00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,180
latest and greatest in technology here

00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,730
is an obligatory picture of me wearing a

00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,710
dorky they are glasses that I'm sure in

00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:03,010
five years people will laugh at if not

00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,869
now but the thing is this picture was

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,970
taken at a hackathon and a lot of my

00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:08,470
experiences with augmented reality and

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,750
virtual reality actually come from

00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,060
hackathons I still remember the very

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,030
first hackathon that I went to that was

00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,670
a VR hack and during that time was the

00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,110
first time I tried the vive headset

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,700
before the hackathon I didn't even know

00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,960
what a vive headset was I didn't know

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,450
what a cardboard was I didn't know what

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,460
the difference between the two were

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,440
going to this and experiencing virtual

00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,750
reality for the first time was

00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,670
awe-inspiring it's something that you

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,150
really have to experience in order to

00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,010
understand since then I've gone to a ton

00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,140
of other hackathons with a bunch of my

00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,450
friends the one at the top is the

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,729
discover AR hackathon and there we

00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,920
invented a way in order to do gesture

00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:51,189
based authentication for virtual reality

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,799
spaces hollow sense was another

00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:57,100
hackathon with using the hololens and

00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:59,860
for that we did things like a sonar for

00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,409
the blind and subtitles for people so

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,450
the versatility of virtual reality is

00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:08,229
boundless you can do anything that you

00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:10,060
put your mind to and it's really really

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,670
exciting living in the present the

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,120
technology that we have today is what we

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,819
have been dreaming for about four years

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,300
does anyone remember this scene from

00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:25,069
Star Wars which doesn't have sound

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,150
anyway the idea is that

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,590
this scene came up it was the very first

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,519
representation of augmented reality in

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,890
the cinema this is one Princess Leia

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,379
asks for help from obi-wan Kenobi

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,780
and so this is interesting right because

00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:43,939
this is decades ago and we are still not

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,909
quite there with the technology but we

00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:49,069
have made a lot of progress so I have a

00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:51,409
short quiz for you guys can you guess

00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:53,629
this is called a stereoscopic photo

00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:58,549
can you guess when the stereoscopic

00:02:53,629 --> 00:03:00,500
photo was first made 1920 1940 or 1960

00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:06,439
okay raise your hand if you think it's

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:10,370
1920 1940 1960 well you guys are all

00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:13,129
right on okay how about this one so this

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,489
device was made in 1950 can you guess

00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:21,260
what it was called the sense box virtual

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:26,209
sphere or sensorama sense box virtual

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,810
sphere Center Rama nice so if you think

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,370
about it

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,290
we've been thinking about virtual

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,329
reality and what it means to be inside

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,519
of a different world for a long time

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:36,919
the sensorama was supposed to be not

00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,319
just vision like the the stereoscopic

00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:42,079
photograph but it also incorporated

00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,419
other senses things like sound also

00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:46,430
feeling so for example have you ever

00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:48,500
gone to those 4d movies where they like

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,299
show something scary on the screen and

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,790
spritz water on you to make it feel as

00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:54,709
if it's attacking so stuff like that the

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,930
idea of virtual reality and augmented

00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,590
reality is that it augments all the

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,729
first senses not just vision or sound

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,169
okay what about this device it's

00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:05,449
starting to look a little bit more like

00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:08,169
a cardboard is it the vision box

00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:11,349
telesphere mask or reality glasses

00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:14,769
vision box tell us through your mask

00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:18,109
reality glasses listens telesphere masks

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,849
so as the years progressed these devices

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:21,709
became smaller and smaller and we

00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:25,430
started attaching it to our periphery

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:27,500
but to our vision okay one more this is

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,699
called the VPL data suit can you guys

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:38,840
guess when I was invented 1980 1990 or

00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:45,440
2000 1980 1990 2000 cool it was 1980

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:48,200
in the 1980s so the vpl data suit the

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,930
whole idea was that this was rigged with

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,669
motors and vibrators so that as you

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,680
walked around in this virtual world you

00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:56,480
could feel different objects there now

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,669
it looks really doofy and it feels kind

00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,470
of silly to do something like that but

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:04,130
the thing is stuff like this exists

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,020
today in fact one of my teammates from

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:09,080
one of my colleagues from university

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,120
started a company recently called hard

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,280
light VR and they do this full-on

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,750
bodysuit that you put on and as you walk

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,970
around in the virtual world it'll

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,190
vibrate across your back so that you can

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,220
feel as if you're hitting against a wall

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,320
and stuff like that so these dreams are

00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,720
really becoming realities and if you

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,700
think about it there's so many different

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,440
devices on the market today this is the

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,290
vibe has anyone here tried the vibe

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,960
before okay a bunch of you guys the vibe

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,150
is a virtual reality device but it also

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,889
has a camera on the front so you can do

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,570
augmented reality so you can't see your

00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,919
surroundings it comes with two

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,020
controllers and the way that this one

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,630
works is that your tether tethered to a

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,250
debt like a desktop computer so although

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,470
you can move around and maybe like a

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,650
three meter square box you can't really

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:56,690
move past that this one's called the

00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,700
oculus rift it's very similar

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,760
it has controllers and it's also ten

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,890
tethered to a desktop then we get into

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,690
devices that allow you to move around

00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,000
freely because all of the processing is

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,729
on board the device so this one is the

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,010
Google daydream and with this what they

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:15,139
did was all of the processing for it is

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,990
on Europe you're on your phone similar

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:20,360
to the Google cardboard and lastly

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,190
there's things like the hololens this

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,200
one again has all of the processing on

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,910
the device in fact it runs Windows a

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,910
Windows 10 machine running on the device

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,440
so that you can walk around the hololens

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,539
is different from these other devices

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,580
because it's augmented reality and what

00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,560
that means is instead of just being able

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,970
to see the screen in front of you you

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,430
can see the surroundings and see

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,440
holograms overlaid on top of it so

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,050
that's pretty cool and have you guys

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,120
seen this in the news anyone so this is

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,340
a new augmented reality device called

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,140
the magic leaf and whether or not we'll

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,289
be walking around with devices like

00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,389
these strapped to our heads

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:58,919
I'd like you to imagine a future of

00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:01,469
augmented reality so in this video this

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,080
is a video called hyper reality it's a

00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:06,089
simulation of what a shopping experience

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,789
might be if you have augmented reality

00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:10,169
everywhere and so here there's a little

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:12,180
pet that's kind of like a shopping

00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:13,589
helper that tells you what you forget

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,050
but as you look around you see that

00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:19,139
there are ads shown on different parts

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,759
of the of the store you can see that it

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,710
recognized that those are coconuts or

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,199
pineapples and based on that it's able

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:28,379
to say hey you forgot this item in your

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,449
grocery cart or it's able to add

00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,689
additional information about any item

00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:36,119
you pick up now what would a world like

00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:38,009
this look like if it crashed so here's

00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:40,229
an example of the system rebooting and

00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:42,809
here you can see that once the system is

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,809
off this is kind of the imagination that

00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:49,020
they had is you have a bunch of markers

00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:52,319
in order to detect where to place this

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,389
augmentation on top of in order to do AG

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,399
mented reality like this we need markers

00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,769
in the real world that are able to tell

00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:04,110
us where the where the device goes on

00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:07,199
top of so it's funny that we use this as

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,479
imagination but this is two years ago

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,610
Alibaba already offers a VR shopping

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,830
experience you can put on a cardboard

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,689
headset go into the store and pick out

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,370
products that you want to buy you can

00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:19,529
look at it and you can check out right

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,449
from the virtual store so this isn't

00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:25,139
really the future it's already the

00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:27,419
present there are other devices there

00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,389
are other applications of virtual and

00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:32,969
augmented reality to discover VR applied

00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:35,010
it for an educational purpose and what

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,529
they did was if you wanted to for

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,300
example teach kids about sharks you

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,180
can't take them underwater but you can

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,720
give them a headset to take a look at a

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:48,509
different wildlife this idea of using

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,250
virtual reality for education is really

00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:53,069
interesting because it gives you a new

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:55,769
way of processing information one of the

00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:58,560
hackathons that I judged last year the

00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,139
MIT reality virtually hackathon one of

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,000
the teams had a really interesting idea

00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:05,610
say you have a ton of MRI scans that are

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,709
flat 2d images what if we paddled

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,079
up and stack them right next to each

00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:12,269
other so that you can get a 3d vision of

00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:14,640
the brain it's a whole new way of

00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:16,500
processing data that used to be static

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,630
because now you can look inside the

00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,640
human body or look inside the brain and

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,450
analyze things in a way that you never

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,540
could before

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,279
and then there's more fun applications

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,000
anyone here still play Pokemon go

00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:34,320
Pokemon oh I have two hands on maybe

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,810
three Pokemon go maybe a year ago was

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,570
like all the rage and why was it so

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,790
popular although it was a very simple

00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,130
idea there wasn't any interaction

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,029
between the Pokemon and the Saran and

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,790
its background

00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:49,800
it made it contextual it made it feel as

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,470
if the Pokemon was actually there and

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,029
this is really easy to do right you

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,130
could do this in a web browser super

00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,380
simply just use a video feed and then

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,899
overlay a div on top of it augmented

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:05,160
reality augmented reality does not have

00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:07,050
to be complicated another example of a

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,260
useful product that you might think of

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,149
is Wayfarer Wayfarer came out with this

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,220
augmented reality application that would

00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:16,350
let you visualize furniture before you

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,199
bought it because they're an online

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,329
shopping retailer they want you to be

00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:23,579
able to feel confident in the furniture

00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,529
that you buy and how it would look in

00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:28,050
your space before you make the purchase

00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:30,690
now this was originally written using

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,430
the Google's tango can tango enabled

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,649
devices but I believe that they've now

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,329
moved on to air core so there's a lot of

00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,800
different kinds of devices that allow

00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:41,970
you to do really interesting things

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:45,269
these days virtual and augmented reality

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,190
are about to revolutionize how we live

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,290
and experience the world around us if

00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,750
you think about it these examples that I

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,699
showed you might seem kind of silly but

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,920
so did the first few days first few

00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:57,540
years of the Internet it kind of feels

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,870
like the space that we're in right now

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:04,410
with virtual and augmented reality is

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:06,029
this is like 1990s we're just figuring

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,290
out what it should look like what it

00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:10,380
should feel like and it's a really

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,600
exciting time to be in and because of

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,850
this I think it's really important to

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,709
talk about who has access to these

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,470
devices and how we can make it more

00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:21,730
available to everyone around the

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:24,500
world democratizing AR means that one

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:27,800
everyone has access to an AR enabled

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:31,820
device and to anyone can build augmented

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,370
reality experiences now if you look at

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,530
so if you look at um all of those

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,390
devices that I showed you before none of

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,490
those were web-based right we had the

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,890
vibe we had the hololens we had the

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,810
oculus but the thing is if you look at

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,030
how many of these devices sold and

00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,710
compared to the Google cardboard for

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,100
instance you'll see that the Google

00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,650
cardboard vastly outsold all of the

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,290
other devices combined what is this

00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,150
telling us people that are trying out

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,550
virtual and augmented reality for the

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,890
very first time are doing so on low-end

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:06,260
devices things like the Google cardboard

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,030
or on their mobile phones and if you

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,820
think about it that makes sense our

00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:13,310
mobile phones have become so powerful

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:16,460
over the last few years it's it possible

00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:19,490
to do augmented reality applications

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,130
with them so if you think about it

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,110
everyone already has access to an air

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:27,470
device it's in their back pockets or

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,510
phones and the second one is anyone can

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,640
build an AR experience if we make it

00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:34,160
easy to put together an augmented

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,350
reality experience just as it is to

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,710
build a website then anyone can start

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:42,830
building these things by themselves so

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,540
as web developers I believe that we can

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,370
shape the future of virtual and

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,500
augmented reality by building

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,750
applications for the mobile web there

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,420
are already a lot of api's that enable

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,370
us to do this and so today I'm going to

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,240
talk to you guys about one way that we

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:02,150
can we can get there so first let's talk

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:06,410
about the present state of web and web

00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:08,120
the yarn air so first when you think

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,250
about web vr there are a lot of

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,800
different libraries out there the most

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,930
basic of which is WebGL WebGL is if you

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,670
want to write like pure vector math in

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,580
order to develop your virtual reality

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:22,460
applications 3GS is a JavaScript library

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,590
that was built on top of WebGL and what

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,540
it does is it exposes higher-level API

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,730
so you can do things like create cameras

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:32,010
or place objects without really having

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,590
to worry about like all of the vertices

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,510
vertex math there are two more libraries

00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,400
that I'm really excited about right now

00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,380
one is a frame which you might have

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,410
heard about before and the other is

00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:46,260
react 360 a frame allows you to create

00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,390
virtual reality applications using a

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,000
component based architecture it like

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:54,390
HTML components so in order to for

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,330
example create a box you just have HTML

00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,460
tags and a box it's very simple

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,500
you should definitely check it out the

00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,810
AK 360 is another interesting one

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,910
especially at JS conf I feel like a lot

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,620
of us are really into react and the

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,680
reason is because it helps us manage

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,540
complex application state so if you have

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,430
a virtual reality application that has

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,410
many different components that need to

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,360
talk to each other and need to be able

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,000
to say hey like this button was quick so

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,480
turn this view on react 360 is a really

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,370
interesting choice reactor 60 offers

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,650
something that has a model that's

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,500
slightly different from a frame so it

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:34,020
has this notion of panels and models a

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,120
panel is basically something in 3d space

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,030
that's flat so think of something like a

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,650
paper or a post around the wall a model

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:43,950
is something that's three-dimensional

00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:47,520
think of like a model of a sofa we'll

00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:50,370
come back to this later now let's talk

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,410
about web AR so web AR is still kind of

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,300
in its infancy there are three kind of

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:59,040
big libraries that people tend to use

00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:05,460
when working with web AR ojs is one of

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:08,010
them jsr Rico and lastly a rjs the thing

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:12,630
is all of these libraries so are eco and

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:15,090
ojs are built on top of the article so

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,860
Ericka is basically a library that was

00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:20,520
written in C that allows you to detect

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,800
certain types of markers and figure out

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,810
what the poses of those markers so that

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,210
you can put items on top of it I'll

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,460
explain that in a second a rjs was

00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,260
poured it uses a our tool kit on the

00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:35,130
underside so those are like the two

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:37,170
competing frameworks right now a ijs is

00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,120
pretty awesome like I think of all of

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,280
the libraries that I've used so far RJ

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,340
seems to be the one that's farthest

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:47,080
along you can use a rjs with

00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,510
frame so for example if you want to

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,800
create augmented reality in your a frame

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:55,450
application there's this really easy

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,550
component that you can use in order to

00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,740
add augmented reality to your a frame

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,770
application and less than ten lines of

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:05,080
HTML so if this is something that works

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,340
for you then definitely check it out now

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,930
looking at the slide you're thinking

00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,570
okay Christina you're just telling me to

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,820
go home and check out a rjs but the

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,530
thing is I've used this before and I ran

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,290
into some problems especially because

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:18,880
the markers aren't very customizable

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,290
these are the markers that AR all of

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,530
those libraries that I talked to you

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:27,250
guys about before I use so they use the

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:29,980
article markers or the hero markers AR

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,600
Jas uses the hero marker and you can

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,370
customize what goes in the middle of it

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,320
but you can't customize the borders so

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,940
you still have these really thick black

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,980
borders if you want to use these markers

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,570
and while it's fine for some

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,310
applications if you want to put it on

00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,950
like a poster or if you want to put it

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,780
on something that is designed it can be

00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:50,560
a little bit frustrating to have to deal

00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:52,690
with these limitations so that's kind of

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,400
where we're at right now with Web VR and

00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,910
AR there's a lot going on and it's

00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,000
constantly evolving next I want to talk

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:06,850
to you about QR a rjs and how you can

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,290
use it so what is curare rjs when I was

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,450
working on a project a while ago at a

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,160
hackathon I noticed that these markers

00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,650
look just like you are codes and yet

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,800
they're not so the idea was could we use

00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:20,650
QR codes instead now QR codes don't have

00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,810
to look ugly snapchat uses basically a

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,000
QR code in order to share your share

00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,950
contact information the one right below

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,620
that is from Twitter so Twitter also

00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:32,230
uses QR codes and you can customize QR

00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,270
codes to your heart's extent pretty much

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,810
you can change the color you can change

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:40,240
the corner eyelets and the dots that go

00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,760
inside of it this means that if you

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,490
wanted to add a QR code to your design

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,820
and make it look use make it make it

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:51,520
design to fit with the rest of your

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,140
whatever whatever you yeah to make it

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,050
fit with the rest of it you can

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,480
definitely do it the other thing is

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,520
because QR codes are actually a code

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,130
is standardized across multiple

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,559
different platforms many phones already

00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,720
have QR code scanners for example

00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:09,549
iPhones have a QR code scanner in the

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,500
Chrome browser so you can just point to

00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:15,610
a QR code and scan it and go to the

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:18,700
website directly so this is kind of how

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,320
standards are proliferate right I wanted

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,340
to come up with a new way of combining

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:29,620
QR codes with the existing AR AR

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:32,590
libraries so introducing QR a rjs cure a

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,290
rjs is a way for you to add augmented

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,990
reality to your applications that uses

00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,700
QR codes as markers there are two

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,400
different types of models that you can

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:45,970
add to your applications one is a 3d

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,490
model and second is a 2d plane and this

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,710
is partially inspired by react 360s

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,110
notion of planes and models and the idea

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,870
is if you want to create a 3d object

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,600
then you probably probably need a higher

00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:01,030
level of computation but if you're just

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,740
transforming a 2d plane then you can

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:09,610
probably get away with doing a little

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:11,830
less that's my demo it works so that's a

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,330
great transition so instead of talking

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,549
about it I figured it would be a good

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,799
idea to just show you what I mean so

00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:22,020
we'll see if this works because my

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:31,780
presentation is on a different slide ok

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:34,240
so here we are okay so earlier you might

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,429
have noticed that a bunch of these cards

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,610
are on your table you can go ahead and

00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:41,290
try scan the QR code disclaimer I

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,570
haven't tested this on all mobile

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,520
devices just my own and it was still a

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,929
little janky so definitely try it out

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,179
but you can also try it out on your

00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:54,460
laptop it might be smoother you can just

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:57,510
go to cure a r-j Escom so I'm going to

00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,110
go ahead and open up the first demo

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,110
which is this guy

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,620
okay so what this is doing right now is

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,350
its use the getusermedia in order to

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,360
pull the video video feed from the

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,580
browser and then once it had that it

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,590
added it to the screen using a canvas

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,990
you see some glitching it's not perfect

00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,890
yet but what this is doing is now it's

00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,090
overlaying my r2d2 on top of this

00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,950
remember that example that we looked at

00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,570
earlier where r2d2 is projecting a

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,850
hologram we're going to try it and go

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:34,780
ahead and recreate that using curare rjs

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:39,080
so the first step is we need to create a

00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:50,390
3d model in order to create a 3d model I

00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:52,880
used a software called blender so

00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,010
basically so what I did was a user in

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,350
order to create this model it's kind of

00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,810
cute if you look at it when it's stable

00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,790
I basically just took a sphere and a

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,410
cylinder join them together then I use

00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:05,810
something called the texture paint in

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,880
order to paint on top of it you can go

00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,040
ahead and download an actual model off

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,780
of a lot of different websites there are

00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,030
a lot of sites that offer free models

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,590
that you can use but in essence there's

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,900
two main pieces to the model

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,480
there's the object file and the material

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,700
file so the object file basically says

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,470
this is what the 3d object is and the

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,840
object fell is dictated by a set of

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:30,170
vertices so for example in the case of

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,760
r2 you had points alongside everywhere

00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:34,340
on the sphere you notice that it wasn't

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,260
perfectly round this is in order to

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,450
optimize for performance the fewer

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,730
vertices there are the less vector math

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,800
you have to do the second piece of the

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:45,470
puzzle is the material file and what the

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,750
material file says is given this image

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,210
or the given this image how do you map

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:55,730
it on top of the object let's take a

00:21:50,210 --> 00:22:00,200
look at those now so if I go ahead and

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:04,280
open up my console should be able to

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:09,410
show you this guy so this is my

00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:12,170
beautiful painting of r2d2 so if you

00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,550
look at all this code is on github by

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,429
the way I'll show you that in a second

00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:18,649
but this is the so this is the texture

00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:20,629
map that it's using and so the material

00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:24,980
file says given this image how do you

00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:26,360
wrap it around this model object okay so

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,779
what does the code look like for this

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,330
I'm using the cure AR 3d library and

00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:35,919
I've can you guys see this in the back

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:39,379
can you give me a thumbs up okay cool

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:42,619
so what I'm doing here is I'm using the

00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:45,080
the QR Air library first I need to use

00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:48,409
three J s the cute the library takes in

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,029
a three J s object so you can pass in

00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,440
whatever you want you can create

00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:52,850
multiple different objects and group

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,980
them together if that's what you want to

00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:57,470
transpose on this plane but it son

00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,840
opinionated about that so you need a

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,919
dependency on three the three object

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,700
loader and the three material loader

00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:10,159
lastly over here I'm importing the QR AR

00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:12,679
library itself so it's on unpackaged so

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,570
you don't have to use npm fee if you're

00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,740
kind of just in the browser but if you

00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:20,629
are an NPM you can just npm install that

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,970
once we have that this is all the code

00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:24,649
it takes in order to write this so first

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,860
we're getting three this is just a

00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:29,779
selector the important code is over here

00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,059
first we're creating a material loader

00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:34,519
and an object loader once we have that

00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:38,990
we're saying load all the materials from

00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:41,360
this asset path load the r2d2 MTL file

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:44,570
which is a material file and once these

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,480
are pre-loaded set it on the object then

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:50,690
load the r2d2 object file and once we

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,600
have that we will have a 3GS object

00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,309
which we can pass into QRA our 3d the

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,049
only line of code that you really need

00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:01,759
from the library is this one right here

00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:04,879
you just call QRA rjs qra our 3d passing

00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:07,309
the library three Jas and then you need

00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:09,200
to pass in the root element so this is

00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:11,269
where it'll go ahead and add this whole

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,100
overlay so it'll go ahead and request

00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:17,899
for user media then create a canvas and

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:21,470
add the video overlay this is telling it

00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:23,360
about how big your marker is in the

00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,970
physical world so in this case it's

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,220
about 10 centimeters so 100 millimeters

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,900
you need this because when you transpose

00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,940
a marker in the real world

00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,250
you need to know how much to rotate it

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,100
by in the virtual world so you need the

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,530
size of the actual physical marker next

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,540
you pass in the object and lastly you

00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,130
pass in a scale of the object in this

00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,410
case the object was kind of small when I

00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,870
exported it so I just bumped it up by 20

00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:54,530
and that's pretty much it once you have

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:56,930
this your AR will go in find the div

00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,750
that's passed in in this case to our AR

00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:03,680
3d and if we look at it in the elements

00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:06,980
panel you'll see that it added two

00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,410
things this canvas is the three j/s

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,170
canvas so this is the WebGL canvas that

00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,760
it renders the model on top of and the

00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,550
second thing that it added is this video

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,600
so that it streams the video from the

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:23,810
webcam feed and once you have all of

00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,670
this you can just put this in front of

00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:33,980
it and rotate it around and that's

00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:36,140
pretty much it so in a few lines of code

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,750
you're able to add a 3d model to your

00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,820
application it automatically detects the

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,800
QR code and it's able to transpose the

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,780
image on top of it you don't have to

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,300
worry about any of that vector math and

00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:49,340
all you really need to do is just create

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,000
the 3d model that you want to pass in

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:55,820
and configure it I want to show you

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
another demo so this one is using the

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:05,000
two D transpose method so if you go to a

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,870
QR AR 2d HTML this is just a flat image

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,670
and once it loads you'll see that is

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:13,760
transposing this image on top of this

00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:15,530
object let's take a look at what this

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,420
looks like so I mentioned earlier that

00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,220
there's the two different with two

00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,690
different types of models the 3d model

00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,970
of where you want to create a like a

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:25,490
whole 3d object and you want to put it

00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,590
in the scene and secondly the 2d plane

00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,600
so this is like for example if you

00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,490
wanted to replicate something like paper

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,830
or a menu item that you wanted to click

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,080
around in now one thing that kind of

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,180
frustrated me when I used react 360 is

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,280
that it doesn't actually support HTML a

00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,559
regular jeaious JSX

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:46,129
you have to write specific components

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:49,279
texts or VR buttons in order to create a

00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:51,649
panel so what I did here was using the

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,620
same principles as the three of the 3d

00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:59,509
model it's a little glitchy so bear with

00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:03,289
that but the code is really simple in

00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:05,440
order to set this up we just need one

00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:09,049
line of code that's it

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,210
QR a rjs here are a are 2d it takes in

00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:14,090
three things one is the root element

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:16,129
similar to the 3d version the second is

00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,289
the size of the marker again same as the

00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:21,080
previous version and the less is it

00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:23,809
takes an HTML element so you can pass in

00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,850
any HTML element in this into this in

00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:29,299
this case we're passing in this panel

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:31,399
and all the panel has is this image

00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:33,139
asset logo but this could have anything

00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,669
in the world it could have text it could

00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:37,999
have men you could have a whole react

00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:40,129
app or an iframe and what it does under

00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:43,100
the hood is it goes in and it uses the

00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:45,590
same the same math in order to figure

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,080
out what the transpose it is and then it

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,830
uses CSS transforms in order to overlay

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,539
the HTML element on top of that QR code

00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:56,090
what this means is that we don't need a

00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:59,029
like a WebGL canvas so we're saving a

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,799
lot of computational power there it also

00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:02,210
means that if you already have something

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,059
that you kind of want to throw together

00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:07,940
really quickly then it's easy to do if

00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:10,009
you've ever dealt with like trying to

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,139
add just a simple image and threw it in

00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:14,869
like the 3d world you know that it's

00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:16,730
like a huge pain in the butt this is way

00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:18,860
easier right you just need an HTML

00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,860
element and you can pass in whatever you

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:25,039
want to it and so with this one line of

00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,590
code you can create a flat panel in this

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:31,850
3d space that's pretty much all you need

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:33,919
and if you look at what it generates all

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:36,499
it has is this is the panel that we're

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,710
passing in hey I wonder if this works I

00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:45,320
could probably edit it I haven't tried

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:48,129
this let's see if that works so if I add

00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,129
high on there

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,240
you can see that you can barely see it

00:28:51,760 --> 00:29:02,320
but it's at the top of the je s so like

00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:04,360
anything that you want in there so you

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,880
can imagine what you could imagine some

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,350
of the possibilities here if you if you

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,360
were to use something like this then you

00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:12,550
could create things like an additional

00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,690
menu or for example say you I'm just

00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,309
making this up but say you have a

00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,320
business card and you want to have like

00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:18,820
a add me on LinkedIn button you could

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,270
totally do that it's just a website

00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:27,720
right um ok cool

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:27,720
so with that I'll go back to my slides

00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:40,510
ok so just to recap we looked at two

00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,970
different demos one was the QR a our 3d

00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,710
version in order to get this to work all

00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,170
you need to do is first import the

00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,179
library import the 3 J s dependencies

00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,880
and then you can use it in your code

00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:54,460
over here the only line of code from the

00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,920
library that you need to use is QR a rjs

00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:00,640
doc you are a are 3d you pass in the

00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:05,800
three library route elements the size of

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:08,980
the scale and lastly the object and the

00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:12,190
object and the scale of the object for a

00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:14,429
QR AR 2d what you can do is you just

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:19,090
need to again import the library and

00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:20,410
create an element called panel and or it

00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,900
doesn't have to be called panel just

00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:25,420
create an HTML element and then you pass

00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,580
in three things the route which is where

00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:30,400
the whole thing gets the video and

00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,770
everything gets added the second is the

00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,929
marker size and lastly it's the HTML

00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,440
panel that you want to transpose on top

00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:37,360
of it

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,050
the interesting thing here is you can

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,440
combine the two as well so let me go

00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:46,720
back to my demo so this is the one that

00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:54,250
you guys are probably seen earlier but

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:57,130
if you go to index.html you will see

00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:00,550
that I've recreated that r2d2 message

00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:04,030
over here you have this you have the

00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:06,640
bots and you have both the 3d and the 2d

00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,770
overlaid on on the same transpose this

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,570
is just a simple example but you could

00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:12,490
imagine you can do anything with this if

00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,470
I hit this will play a sound I think my

00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:22,030
computer is muted but you guys kind of

00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:23,670
heard it earlier so so yeah okay now let

00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:33,160
me go back to my slides one more time

00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:37,150
sorry about that okay so you can combine

00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:41,890
pure air 3d and 2d and if you want to

00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:45,490
use this as of an hour ago it's on NPM

00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:47,350
under QRA rjs so feel free to download

00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,950
it try it out let me know what you think

00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:52,720
it's also on unpackage and on github

00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,640
also stuff that I did today is also

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,230
going to be on github so you can use it

00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,780
as examples if you want to build your

00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:04,290
application so that's curiae rjs and how

00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,640
you can use it with a few lines of code

00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:09,310
lastly I want to talk to you about the

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,230
next steps with QRA rjs and what

00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:15,040
augmented what's in store for augmented

00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:18,010
reality in the web so let's talk about

00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,380
how curare rjs works it's kind of it

00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:22,690
boils down to these few steps so first

00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,640
we need to get the users media so this

00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,920
gets the video stream from the user in

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,540
order to analyze this right now and post

00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,820
putting it on a canvas because there's

00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,700
no way to get image data directly from a

00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:36,220
stream so once we have the image data

00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:38,620
all that is is a giant array of all of

00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,620
the pixels this gets passed into the

00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:44,770
marker locator in our case the marker is

00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,900
a QR code and what it does is given an

00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,930
image it returns the four corners of the

00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,730
QR code those four corners get passed

00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,860
into something called the pose estimator

00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:56,530
so it turns out this is actually a very

00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:59,620
challenging problem if you have an image

00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:01,960
of if you have any image and you have

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:04,030
four points on that image on a flat 2d

00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,190
image figuring out what the three D

00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:07,750
transpose was in order to create that

00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,880
it's actually a very

00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:12,040
some problem to solve and especially

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,210
when those four points are coplanar so

00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,880
they're all in the same plane

00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:18,070
you can't 100% be certain what the 3d

00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,920
rotation is so earlier you saw some

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,080
glitches that's because of that but

00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,010
there are some algorithms out there that

00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:29,020
can that can improve that a bit and

00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:30,640
lastly once you get the post so the pose

00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,610
is the rotation and the transform

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,650
transpose so for example like the how

00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:39,430
many degrees it's rotated in each angle

00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:42,520
and how far along in each XY and Z plane

00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:44,620
it is moved along those get passed into

00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,900
the 2d view render and the 3d view

00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:49,600
render and what those do is those then

00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,760
create the 2d view and then the 3d view

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,300
depending on whether you want a plane or

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,370
a model so before we talk about some

00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,950
improvements let's quickly recap on the

00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:01,800
event loop so the event loop if you can

00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,940
think of this as the event loop

00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,160
javascript is single threaded so it can

00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,110
only ever do one thing at a time what

00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,040
this means is if you're executing code

00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:14,110
it can't render you can the so it's

00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:18,790
called a loop so oh you can see my mess

00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:22,540
um so the process the process goes

00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,950
around in the circle and it has a few

00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,990
different things that needs to do in

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:28,419
order to re-render the sight style

00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:30,850
layout and paint just to oversimplify a

00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:32,610
bit so every time you render something

00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,840
on the page it goes through the cycle

00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:37,000
now what happens if you have to perform

00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,149
a task say looping through an array of

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,399
4,000 pixels what it does is when it's

00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:45,220
performing this task it can't go in and

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,870
render your render your scene so what

00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,669
this means is that your scene will seem

00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:50,830
kind of janky and that's kind of that's

00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:55,179
that's where I'm at with the library

00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:57,700
right now what you and the other thing

00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:00,070
is it can also only the browser can

00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,260
decide whether it performs the tasks or

00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,600
skips it and/or performs the render or

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,460
not so what you can do in order to

00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,770
alleviate some of this is use things

00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,660
like a web worker a web worker is a way

00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:13,060
to add a secondary thread to your

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,070
JavaScript right now all we've been

00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:18,640
using is the UI thread but you can spin

00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,200
up a web worker thread this is similar

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,770
to service workers if you've heard of

00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,680
that term

00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:25,300
for and what it does is it takes your

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,030
tasks and does the processing on that

00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,070
thread I tried to use this for the

00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:32,860
project and what I found out was that

00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,690
right now there's a bug where there's a

00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,240
huge secure the vulnerability with

00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,950
shared memory buffers and so in order to

00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,600
share memory from one thread to the

00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,760
other you have to serialize it down to

00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,650
like a string and then deserialize it

00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,930
and so when dealing with really large

00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:49,870
images this ended up being slower like

00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:51,550
the serializing and deserializing ended

00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,470
up being slower than just processing it

00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,930
on the main thread but I expect that to

00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:57,700
change in the future another thing that

00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:59,830
you can do to improve this performance

00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,540
is to use something like web assembly if

00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,250
you use something like web assembly then

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,350
what it does is it makes it faster to

00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,210
process tasks this is because all of

00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,590
your JavaScript is already compiled so

00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:11,620
it doesn't have to interpret it when

00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:13,330
it's running again I tried to look into

00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,250
web assembly and one of the libraries I

00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,750
looked at it was assembly script all of

00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,460
the code I have right now is written in

00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,870
typescript an assembly script is a

00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,700
library that allows you to take

00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:24,970
typescript and transpile it down to web

00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:27,910
assembly however using this I learned

00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:30,130
that assembly script isn't exactly

00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,690
typescript it's a subset of it and so I

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,760
would have to get rid of a lot of my

00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,120
classes or custom types in order to use

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,100
it but that might be another optimation

00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,260
optimization to do in the future so the

00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,970
two places that we can optimize are with

00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,330
the marker locator and the pose

00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:48,400
estimator for the marker locator I base

00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:50,140
it off of this library called jsq R

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,210
which is a pure JavaScript library that

00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,500
detects the QR code but you could

00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,150
imagine that if there was a more

00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,340
efficient library that was say written

00:36:55,150 --> 00:37:00,130
in rust or C we could use web assembly

00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:03,280
in order to you in order to use that a

00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:05,410
faster functionality the second one is

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,030
Poe's estimator so this is the thing

00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,040
that I explained earlier that given the

00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,540
four corners on a 2d image it's actually

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,030
quite complicated to get the 3d

00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:15,760
transpose of it and in order to get this

00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:18,610
to work I used I based it off of jsr

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,310
reco turned out that that library had a

00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:23,320
few bugs in it already so that's why

00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:26,920
some of the stuff that I was seeing was

00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:29,320
not exactly right but one optimization

00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,450
in his future was would be to maybe like

00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,250
move off the pose estimator code off to

00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,420
a web worker because that way it frees

00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:37,869
up space for your render

00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:40,480
cycle and if you guys are interested

00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:42,099
this is all on github I currently has

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,430
two contributors but if you know

00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:47,319
anything about WebGL or vector math feel

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,829
free to contribute to it or just check

00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:51,720
it out

00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:54,369
so I really believe that the future of

00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,460
augmented reality for the web is what we

00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:59,049
make of it I think that going along

00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,000
there's a lot of different libraries

00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:03,190
that are have popped up in the past and

00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,329
that will continue to pop up in order to

00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:10,299
do AR in the browser so with that being

00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,930
said I want to leave you with this

00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:13,900
question

00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:16,990
why do you love JavaScript my favorite

00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:19,030
thing about JavaScript is that I love it

00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:21,430
because of its reach and its versatility

00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,170
writing applications in JavaScript is

00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,480
easy because you don't need to set up a

00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:27,369
whole development environment anyone can

00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,680
do it it's very easy to write JavaScript

00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:33,430
in the script tag in an HTML page on the

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,559
browser I'm really excited about this

00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:38,200
prospect because it means that we can

00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,150
allow anyone that's a really beginner to

00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,280
programming to build things like

00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,869
augmented reality and this is just

00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,599
scratching the surface there's so many

00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:48,040
new technologies that are coming to

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,079
JavaScript and to the web land

00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,520
especially with things like web

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,500
assemblies so for example like

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,970
tensorflow j/s is now a thing so you can

00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,720
run machine learning in the browser and

00:38:54,970 --> 00:39:00,579
I think it'll keep growing the mobile

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,740
web is powerful enough to run for

00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:04,510
virtual and augmented reality today and

00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,059
everyone already has the mobile device

00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:11,490
so I invite you to build the future of

00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:11,490
augmented reality together thank you

00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,540
