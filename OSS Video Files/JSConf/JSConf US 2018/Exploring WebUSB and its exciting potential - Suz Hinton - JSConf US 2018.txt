[Music]

00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:31,899
thank you so much that was a really

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,180
sweet intro thanks for coming to my talk

00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:36,100
I know that this is towards the end of

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,129
the day I've heard many naps have been

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,410
taken this afternoon so for those who

00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:44,380
came back from their naps to join thank

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:47,260
you so much I'm very excited to take you

00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:55,690
through an introduction hopefully as

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:57,370
gently as I can to web USB so I did

00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,560
actually have an alternative title for

00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,170
this and if you want to know the meaning

00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,000
behind it I will explain to you after

00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,110
this at the after party but what it

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,689
really wanted to color was how do you

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,570
send a singer and in this the browser

00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:13,869
because that definitely has a little bit

00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,400
of relevancy web USB but before I just

00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:18,460
wanted to introduce myself super quickly

00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,970
if you don't know of me my name is Suze

00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,790
Hinton

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,500
I am new cat or no up cat on the

00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,760
internet you can say it either way it's

00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:30,159
definitely okay to say it either way I

00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,750
work on open source IOT libraries in my

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,760
spare time a lot of them are in

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,280
JavaScript which is why I'm here today

00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,320
if you came to the node bots workshop

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,850
yesterday thank you I was really happy

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,850
to see you there it was really fun

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,090
you saw me really badly explaining

00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,040
certain components in the morning so

00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,250
that was a lot of fun but during the day

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,170
I do have to Anna celery in order to pay

00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,780
my rent so I am in developer relations

00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,780
at Microsoft and I actually do focus on

00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,090
I would say that too but it's more

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,500
security based and IOT in the cloud and

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,670
a lot of enterprise stuff as well so if

00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,110
you're really interested to talk to me

00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,479
about that later - he couldn also come

00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,610
up to me I wanted to also think that

00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:12,489
organizers you may have noticed that I'm

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:15,730
was not originally on the schedule so I

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:17,920
was asked to give this talk a week ago

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,540
so it just bear with me because some of

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,900
the demos are a little rough to you so

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,880
I'll explain that later on as well so

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,320
it's today's aim is to help you see the

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,090
browser and the web in a different way

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,800
I've definitely seen a lot of talks at

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,030
this conference so far that are along

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,910
those lines which i think is really

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,490
really cool and I want you to not be

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,260
scared of hardware and microcontrollers

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,020
because if I can hustle this in like

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,580
less than a week then you can definitely

00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,390
do it it might take a little bit longer

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,520
if you're a beginner but the world of

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,320
hardware is getting ever and ever closer

00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,470
to browsers and that's why I'm really

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,640
excited to tell you about that today so

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,340
the topics were actually going to cover

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,260
just a history of like web and devices

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,540
and how we've been like attempting to

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,650
clumsily smash them together in the past

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,270
what web USB is how to use web USB and

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,310
then like maybe some kind of futures

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,380
stuff that I'm hoping to see and how you

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,040
can kind of help provide a future for it

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:17,320
as well so first of all history of web

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,840
USB and when I beam by that is like

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,390
somehow being able to put browses and

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,280
like devices like arduino x' and drones

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,740
and boats and things like that together

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,730
in the past so we do actually have to go

00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,670
as far back as 2007 to 2009 that was

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,160
when I first started getting into

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,290
hardware and trying to sort of make

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,300
really cool machines but also like talk

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,070
to it with my browser and so the way

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,960
that you did it back then was use flash

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,170
communication server does anyone use

00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,350
that yeah a couple of us were certain to

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,120
be in the minority and you use this

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,709
really cool app called serve proxy and

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,140
what it would do is it would take the

00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,540
serial port data coming in from like

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:02,010
something like an Arduino and it would

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,660
then like proxy that on to like

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,010
basically like a socket so that you

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,170
could actually listen to the data coming

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,130
in in your browser or in flash which is

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,890
really really interesting

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,050
so you would have your Arduino and your

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,610
browser but that was so far apart

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,739
because you had to have all these steps

00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:21,040
in between right so you had so proxy

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:22,150
which would go from serial to TCP so

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,280
that you could then use flash

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,290
communication server and make a flash

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,990
app to listen to that so I think the

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,630
first example I ever did was I had like

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,700
a a trim pot like a little knob that you

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,800
could turn plugged into the Arduino and

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,770
when you turned it there was like a

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,650
circle colored in with a color in flat

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,150
and as you as you turn the knob it would

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,650
either change the cycle through all the

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,870
colors or it would change the shape of

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:51,009
the circle and I thought I was a wizard

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:53,289
basically if the code did not look much

00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,940
like what a wizard would write there was

00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:57,639
a really weird configuration file that

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,270
you used in so proxy where you had to

00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,580
put lots of nerdy things like the baud

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,080
rate and all your stop bits and parity

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,509
and things like that but the flash

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,550
communication stuff in action script is

00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:11,199
pretty readable you know you can kind of

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,520
see what's happening and so it was

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,009
actually pretty friendly once you

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,190
actually got that data coming through

00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:22,389
but we all know what happened with flash

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:24,550
it fell out of vogue for like very you

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:27,310
know understandable reasons and I agree

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,050
with a lot of those reasons and so sadly

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,690
I sort of had to put that method down

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,190
and it was really uncool for a while for

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,759
me to say that I used to be a flash

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:40,419
developer for my day job so we fast

00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,610
forward to 2013 to 2017 and we got this

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:46,000
really cool thing in the Chrome browser

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,889
called chrome serial and just wanted to

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,139
just quickly like before everyone gets

00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,819
excited just to give a little bit of a

00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:55,150
rest and peace there so explain what

00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:56,469
happens later okay so let's start with

00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,060
that scenario again you know we've got a

00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:59,830
load we know and we desperately want our

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,349
browser to like start controlling it and

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,520
showing data and stuff like that so what

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,159
we would do is we would use Chrome

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,340
serial which was an API that allowed us

00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:11,110
to access the the actual like serial

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,180
communication that was built into our

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,800
dueño boards or any other hardware that

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,159
had like a serial port that we could

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,440
connect to and then the only way that we

00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:22,960
could actually use that API was it was

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,870
sort of sandboxed into you I either had

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,210
to have a chrome app and it had to sort

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,830
of run in there so for a while there

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,900
were like really cool things coming out

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,699
where you had a website but you also had

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,979
to kind of install the companion app and

00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,330
it was a little bit clunky but I was

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,250
able to sort of demonstrate some of my

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,469
hardware libraries working within that

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,860
and some people went on to kind of use

00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:46,389
my libraries to make really cool stuff

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,729
and one example that I really really

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,139
loved was the chip computer which some

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:52,539
of you might have seen on Kickstarter a

00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:56,139
few years ago it was a $9

00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:58,180
Linux computer and when you actually got

00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,520
it in the mail you know it takes a while

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:04,120
as we know with Kickstarter's I used to

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,080
work there so I definitely I think I've

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,199
backed one hundred and thirtysomething

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,460
things who knows there they had this

00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,949
really cool chrome app that when you

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,469
plug in your chip you know you could

00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:15,699
just go and install this app and run it

00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,199
in your browser and then you could

00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:19,569
update the firmware in there and I was

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,550
like wow this hardware interface here

00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,349
looks SuperDuper friendly it just

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,759
doesn't look scary like those weird

00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,520
malware looking apps that you normally

00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,439
have to download you know you know it's

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,210
so like update just like this one simple

00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,589
thing and so you know if you're a hobby

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,449
collector of however you have all of

00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:36,789
these ridiculous applications just

00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:38,409
littered in your all over your hard

00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,779
drive and you use them once and you just

00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:42,310
never you forget about them so I think

00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:44,409
at one point I had like six different

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:48,249
versions of the Arduino IDE running four

00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:49,839
different machines that only required a

00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:52,479
certain version so it's a nightmare

00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,939
but speaking of Arduino and I know that

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,129
there's Arduino people here I caught up

00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:58,930
with them earlier it's really cool do we

00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:01,689
know actually went and created this app

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,120
that it's basically a living chrome app

00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,979
that runs on Chrome OS devices which

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,069
means that you can program Arduino

00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:11,259
boards now in the browser with a full

00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,779
IDE and then you can compile and upload

00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,339
that onto the board and that's using

00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:18,099
Chrome serial and I thought that was so

00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:20,919
so very cool and their Arduino create

00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:22,360
platform is just like genius I just

00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,969
actually think it's a better experience

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,349
than the normal audrina ID which has

00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:29,409
been around for a while which was sort

00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:31,389
of like based on the processing ID and

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:33,550
cool fact like they actually used my

00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,079
software or at least they they have been

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,940
in the past you notice to flash the

00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:38,889
Arduino so that was really awesome to

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,899
kind of see my stuff like browser fired

00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:43,240
up a web packed or whatever and and put

00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,370
into a chrome app but you can kind of

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,380
sense that that's a limitation like only

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,389
being able to run that on a Chrome App

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,569
just doesn't mean that you know it's

00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:55,089
available to everybody so you know it

00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:56,680
wasn't an official website either again

00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,660
as I said it only worked in Chrome apps

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,790
which is a pretty narrow ecosystem these

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,800
days because they've sunset chrome apps

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,590
for just browsers and it only works when

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,150
Chrome OS and so that happened in

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,250
20:17 and there were a lot of really

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:12,550
really really really sad no buts people

00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:15,010
that yeah so and so yes so that brings

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,430
us to today and what we've been kind of

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:21,370
doing up until web USB which is browsers

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,800
and web sockets so who went to the the

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,080
was it the smartphone Symphony earlier

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,360
yeah it was pretty cool wasn't it yeah

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,450
so we do the same thing with hardware

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,760
where we use WebSockets and we have like

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,340
a node server running you know on our

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,770
laptop and then we have our browser and

00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,830
our back-end kind of node server is

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,300
speaking by a serial to the Arduino it

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,910
could be johnny-five or something like

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,620
that and then it's sending just like

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,270
messages through to the browser and the

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,190
browser can also send messages back so

00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,990
it's just like your own kind of invented

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,880
protocol for figuring out how to like

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,730
you know how that two-way communication

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,160
and that works okay because I feel like

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,350
there's less distance between the

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,020
Arduino and the browser in this case and

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,960
we are writing JavaScript the whole way

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,700
too which is helpful but again you can

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,920
still see that there's just a few steps

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,900
in order to get going

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,760
you can alternatively package all of

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,780
this up into something like an electron

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,340
app or an N wjs app this is a piece of

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,610
software I made for a Kickstarter

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:29,080
project a while ago the the project is

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:31,930
called the public radio it is a radio in

00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,150
a mason jar and it is a monogamous radio

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,210
where you can only listen to one radio

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,210
station

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,089
and so you can imagine people like I

00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:43,220
changed my mind you know I'm I'm ready

00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,139
to break up with NPR and I want to

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,639
listen to something else so you know

00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:48,079
they had to offer some software in order

00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,579
to like change the radio station right

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,779
and if you moved countries then you

00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:52,639
would have to update the band or the

00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:54,230
frequency or like you know radio is very

00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,660
complicated if you've ever checked out

00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,579
the Wikipedia page and so I created this

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,259
kind of proof of concept electron app

00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:02,089
for them but it was like a hundred

00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,769
megabytes so download just to change

00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:06,170
this radio station and I'm like I'm just

00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:07,939
contributing to the detritus of one off

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,589
apps that are like living on people's

00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:12,139
hard drives and it just didn't feel

00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:13,759
right but this was I was like I can feel

00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,439
it I can smell it was so close to being

00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,750
able to use web technologies you know

00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:21,319
with node in it and JavaScript and it

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:24,620
feels good and even you can technically

00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:27,860
use Arduino to create on you know a

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,779
computer other than a chrome book but it

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:34,759
does still have to run like a background

00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:37,009
app that runs in your tray that kind of

00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:39,139
is able to listen on a socket to be able

00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:41,120
to kind of flash your Arduino so it's

00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:44,149
again a better experience than the

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,040
Arduino ID but it's still having this

00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,779
like coupling in between right and

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,490
that's as you can tell from the theme of

00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:52,220
this that's what's been frustrating a

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,930
lot of us this whole time so now we kind

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,519
of see some of the problems that we've

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,589
had in the past which you might not have

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,149
actually been part of if you haven't

00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:01,819
done hobby before hopefully that helps

00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:03,050
you understand why web USB now is such a

00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:06,139
big deal

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:09,110
and just to let you know I will remind

00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:11,360
you of this later Web USB is a an

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,130
implementation of a different type of

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,290
communication than serial it's just that

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,230
you know Sarah was kind of like what we

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,339
had before this so come and see me if

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,949
you want to sort of know about the

00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,660
differences of them later on so I'm

00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,220
gonna be pulling from the web USB spec a

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,209
lot because I think that this spec is

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:32,000
extremely unique in that it has human

00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:33,290
readable paragraphs and information in

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,990
it and I think it's really well written

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,370
and one of the main authors Riley I had

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,689
the pleasure of like he knows speaking

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,550
back and forth with on the internet

00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:42,829
recently and that's something that he

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,809
deeply cares about and so I definitely

00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:46,370
this is one of the only times I'm going

00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:48,230
to encourage you to check out a spec

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,279
because I think it's really great so I'm

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,850
going to just like pull the main

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,040
messaging

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,709
from it so you can understand so the web

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,130
USB API provides a way to safely expose

00:12:54,709 --> 00:13:00,860
USB to vice services to the web it's

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,720
pretty straightforward what's cool is

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,430
that it provides an API familiar to

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,279
developers who have used existing native

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,110
USB libraries and exposes the device

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,389
interfaces defined by existing

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,920
specifications so what I like about this

00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:14,180
is rather than just reinventing the

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,949
wheel and saying well we're going to use

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,959
USB but we're gonna have our own thing

00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:19,790
and we're gonna like invent this thing

00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:22,130
for the JavaScript community they just

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,630
basically said we're a Melissa you know

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,800
device manufacturers we're aiming this

00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,620
at people who already know what this

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,209
stuff is if we just use the same specs

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,730
then it's probably got a better chance

00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:33,290
of success and it's going to be you know

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,410
it's it's cross-platform knowledge I

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,120
think that's really really cool it is a

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,740
little harder to learn as a result but

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,259
it just means that that knowledge can

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,759
actually be portable to other platforms

00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:45,259
such as just writing like you know on

00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,709
the bare operating system which is kind

00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:48,560
of cool

00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:49,699
so again web USB is different to serial

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,250
they're just different ways of

00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:54,410
interfacing with devices web USB is more

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,199
like the lower-level stuff that most

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,750
professionally manufactured devices know

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,199
how to speak that being said it's not

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,970
you know super mega complex to learn so

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,310
why is web USB better than all of this

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,579
stuff that I offered you know as

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,019
solutions to you just before so the

00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:13,970
first thing that I really like about it

00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:18,050
is that there is a permission based

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:20,779
model here and so if somebody plugs in a

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,550
device and they go to a website in order

00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:26,209
to connect directly to the button the

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:27,949
device via Web USB they actually have to

00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:31,040
give that permission so it's very

00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:34,040
similar to a webcam or your microphone

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,750
or your location I really like that and

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,430
you can actually kind of provide filters

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,990
so that you're only sort of showing your

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,180
device and they don't have to pick from

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,009
a list of weird random stuff that

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,800
they've plugged into their computer so I

00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:48,079
think that's really accessible there I

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,290
think one of the best features is that

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,089
as soon as you plug in a web USB device

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,630
you have the option to provide a

00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:58,519
descriptive on your device that is

00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:02,059
advertised when it's plugged in and its

00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,170
URL and so if your Chrome browser is

00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:06,500
up-to-date and suppose

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,750
by OSB and you plug in a web USB you

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,070
know like compatible device it's going

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,350
to immediately pop up this notification

00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:15,139
and it's going to say hey like I

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:19,130
detected this machine you should go to X

00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:21,139
URL in order to connect so out of the

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,910
box someone has pulled this piece of

00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:24,410
hardware out and they plug it in and

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,240
they immediately know where to go you

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,430
know to to start interacting with it and

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,690
I think that that's one of the single

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,399
most powerful features of this and I

00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:36,170
love that it's just like a descriptor

00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:37,880
that you set on the device but you're

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,550
probably thinking you know where

00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,620
JavaScript developers and every

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,320
everything starts looking like a no

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:48,500
without JavaScript um oh and you know

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,060
why are we doing this in the browser why

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,620
we turn the turn the browser into an

00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,540
operating system it's something that I

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,860
hear a lot so I I just want to talk

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,600
about some of the advantages there might

00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,699
be and why I've being so pushy about

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,779
trying to make make this happen over the

00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:05,389
last few years so in my opinion hardware

00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:07,940
interfaces so writing software to you

00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:09,890
know to integrate with your devices it

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,660
should be faster make it should be

00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,670
cross-platform and it should be easy to

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,070
make a cross-platform it should look

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,660
good and it should be accessible you

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:21,079
know screen readers should be able to

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,640
see it this should be like in easy ways

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,320
in order to make that accessible in

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,940
every single platform without having to

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,380
like learn every system for doing that

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:32,060
as well right and browsers are really

00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,180
commonly installed application on many

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,880
computers this doesn't necessarily

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:41,449
require like the person to be online

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,890
either you know if you wanted to try and

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:46,250
run something on localhost that will

00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:48,890
actually work as well and browser-based

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,170
interface has just happened to be those

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,209
four things that I conveniently put in

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,610
the list before you can rapidly

00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:57,410
prototype web interfaces that you can

00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,350
hop patch them really easily and deploy

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,449
updates CSS is incredibly powerful to

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:04,280
make something look friendly and to help

00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:06,380
you know organize information and things

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,390
like that and you have a consistent

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,000
accessibility tree if you make it

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,069
accessible you know in general in a

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,900
browser by respecting the wicked

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,890
guidelines and making sure that you're

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,880
making use of Aria features my needed

00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,680
then it's going to be accessible to like

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,020
all of the different browser choices if

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,820
we're able to have web usb come to every

00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,470
browser in the future and I think that's

00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,470
actually really really powerful and

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,760
straight from the web USB spec with this

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,230
API hardware manufacturers will have the

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,290
ability to build cross-platform

00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,510
JavaScript SDKs for their devices so you

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,940
know who likes the idea of the fact that

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,950
if really cool stuff comes out on

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,410
Kickstarter or like just you know is

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,180
made by big manufacturers wouldn't it be

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,440
cool if like we were considered a

00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,020
first-class citizen and we immediately

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,780
got JavaScript SDKs to play with and all

00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,850
we needed to know what's HTML and how to

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,440
do control transfers is that like you

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,750
know sending things they could give us

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,370
like a development kit that actually has

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,960
all of that stuff laid out and all the

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:12,330
for us to start using it I think that's

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,160
awesome so how do we use this I can hear

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:19,610
my friend Nathan in the back hi Nathan

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:21,630
he's so cute so you're using Web USB

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,370
it's a little bit involved because we

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,450
have that sort of user permission model

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,160
so I just wanted to step you through

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,170
this really quickly before we look at a

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,570
little bit of code so you've got your

00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,610
user you've got your browser and they've

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,170
plugged their device into it and you

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,330
know the user could be you or it could

00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,340
be like you know someone who's bought

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,960
your product and you want them to start

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,160
you know joining the two together you

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,800
want them to use their browser to

00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,510
interact with the device the first thing

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,740
we need is a user event so they need to

00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,690
do something like click or just

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,880
something intentional in order to start

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,400
the process with pairing to the device

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,320
once they've done that the browser will

00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,300
then look for devices and we can give it

00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,980
an optional filter such as the product

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,840
or the vendor ID so that we can actually

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,750
just fish out exactly what they're

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,510
looking for to help them out

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,250
it then returns any devices that are

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:12,420
plugged in that it finds that matches

00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:14,790
those requirements the browser then says

00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,460
hey I found this device I'm pretty sure

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,930
this is what you want do you give

00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,990
permission for this website to start

00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:23,850
interacting with it the user then

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,190
confirms the permission or they can deny

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:29,070
it or they can just like not do anything

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,530
close the tab which is a sometimes

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,880
coming with other permissions

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,670
but if they do confirm that permission

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,550
then we can immediately start opening

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:41,100
the device connection we can select a

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:43,560
configuration which you'll see in the

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,300
code very soon we claim an interface

00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,800
which again is just like a term that we

00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,870
use when we're using the web ESB

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,700
protocol so we claiming interface in

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,760
order to be able to start like using the

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,320
endpoints of that interface for your in

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,950
and out-out in order to talk to the

00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,090
device and we finally start the

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,070
transference which is really really cool

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,720
but you know when you actually see a

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,430
demo of this which I'm hoping my demo

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,170
works it's a long story

00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,360
but you'll see like that this actually

00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,070
looks very fast it's it's more work for

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,850
the developer than anything but for the

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:16,760
user it feels pretty seamless so this is

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,020
part of the code for for getting started

00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,850
you have your filters so you can see

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,710
here that I have a specific vendor ID

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,570
that I want to look for so this vendor

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,210
ID might belong to a company such as

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:31,470
Arduino or Adafruit or maybe it's your

00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:36,570
own company we then I'm using fancy

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:39,420
async/await and because it's so so I'm

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,370
I'm basically just accessing the USB API

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,290
from the navigator object like how cool

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,030
is that it's directly in the browser and

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,490
so I'm requesting the device by passing

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:50,430
in those options it will eventually come

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,720
back and if it found you know some

00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,740
matches then I'm gonna be able to look

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,330
at the device product name the

00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,740
manufacturer name and things like that

00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:02,010
so that's pretty cool so some of the

00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:05,490
same code is at the top we request the

00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:07,830
device we open the device once it is

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,720
confirmed to be opened we use our data

00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,790
sheets for our devices which again is a

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,680
really cool thing to learn about to

00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:16,200
select the right configuration we want

00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,520
and to claim the right interface so the

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,870
interface is to do with like the

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,080
endpoints where we want to communicate

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:24,330
in and out so devices can have several

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,590
different interfaces so again you can

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,600
check your datasheet to find out which

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,630
one you need after that you can just

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,520
start sending data so I am doing device

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,150
transfer out I'm choosing the first

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,470
sorry the second endpoint on my

00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,680
interface and I'm just sending the byte

00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,870
like 0 sorry 1 a so I'm just sending

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,170
like 1 byte of information and that one

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,820
a might be an opcode it might

00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,490
something like make a noise in my device

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,140
you know it could be start uploading

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,210
firmware or something like that it's

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,680
really up to the device manufacturer so

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,840
it's really hard for me to give you

00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,980
super specific hello world examples

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,170
because it really does depend on the

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,970
device but then we can wait for a

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,820
response which is pretty cool by doing a

00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,920
transfer in instead of a transfer out we

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,800
can supply the endpoint which is the

00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,500
first argument and we can also ask for

00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,690
how many bytes we want so I'm asking for

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,550
five bytes in this case and then we can

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,690
console.log out their response so again

00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,370
if you're not familiar with the USB

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,560
interfaces this might be a bit like I

00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,540
there's a lot of terminology here that I

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,520
don't know about but what I do like is

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,160
that it is built on existing standards

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,420
so you don't have to wait for people to

00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,740
start writing blog posts about this

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,800
stuff you can go and read up on the

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,720
existing USB spec and start using kind

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,160
of more native libraries such as Libya

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,550
speak if you really wanted to to get

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,260
started and again I love data sheets

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,570
just want to take a moment to respect

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,980
how awesome they are and so they will

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,510
give you this information that you're

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,310
looking for and often it's in handy

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,140
table format so you can see here it's

00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:53,050
giving you how many configurations there

00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,610
are and things like that so if you see

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,890
that there's only one configuration then

00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:59,350
you can just like pick the zero one

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,610
right so it will actually sometimes give

00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,170
you that information and if you don't

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:06,550
know a lot you can just guess and

00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:11,020
eventually it will work so yeah so I

00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:12,940
didn't do a lot of hardware demos

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,430
anymore I tend to talk more on a variety

00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:19,330
of topics but I'm sort of known for my

00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:22,000
hardware talks so I'm gonna do some

00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:26,470
demos uh-huh so we'll see how they go

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,300
these are especially fragile demos for a

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,670
couple of reasons so my first disclaimer

00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,010
to you is that Web USB you know it's

00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,690
changing it's new it's fancy it really

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,640
works in Chrome

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,160
and everything that I've made is on

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,430
weird get branches on my local computer

00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,200
that I've deployed somewhere and some of

00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,920
it was written on airplanes so it's not

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,110
fantastic the other thing is this is

00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,270
literally where I was when I got a call

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:53,920
from Deus cough saying someone dropped

00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:56,380
out do you want to give a talk

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,360
and I was like uh I don't really have

00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,280
any of my stuff on me like I don't have

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,030
any of the stuff that I could you know

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:07,060
show how Web USB works or anything so I

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:08,650
did call in my friend Rick I was like

00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,630
hey do you have all this stuff you're

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,490
coming to jail scones do you have a chip

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:15,280
that you don't care if I brick like and

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,230
he was really great so thank you Rick

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,940
for saving me today and I just wanted to

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,940
give him a quick can because thank you

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,750
so what I really wanted to do was I

00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:30,850
wanted to show you the futures of Web

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:34,150
USB right I want it to be like here's a

00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:35,950
chip you know it's a bit micro chip that

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,110
you know you can like you flick off an

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,720
hour dimino and sup programming and the

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,950
little the sort of like long red device

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,840
you see at the top is actually a

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:46,360
programmer and that programmer does

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,680
speak Web USB so theoretically you know

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,020
I was going to show you this thing that

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,300
uploads code to the chip and everything

00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,790
but unfortunately this is all I brought

00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,650
with me on my vacation and I feel like

00:24:54,790 --> 00:25:00,250
that's still a decent amount to bring on

00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:02,290
a vacation so I had a lot of stuff

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,550
there's been a lot of macgyvering over

00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,140
the last few days so if you've seen me

00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,580
intently like putting jump wise

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,770
everywhere and tweeting about needing

00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,780
jumping jump was that was me trying to

00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,460
get that really cool demo that I just

00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,670
showed you here to work and I just

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,100
couldn't get it going I did half hack an

00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,300
Arduino to get it to pretend to be this

00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,650
programmer and I was like really proud

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,480
of that but yeah I just didn't quite get

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:25,120
there so I do apologize but I do have a

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,860
video of that demo but I do have a

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,300
different demo that you'll probably kind

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,730
of resonate with better anyway

00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,350
so I'm going to show you that um really

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,390
quickly and then if we have time I can

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,520
show you the other video so you can see

00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:43,990
that I have a camera focused on me that

00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:46,000
is deliberate I don't like so I have

00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,410
this device here so on the bottom is

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,210
like you can think of this as the

00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,100
Arduino board this one is from Adafruit

00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,620
it's the feather 32 u 4

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,660
it's a fantastic little device and you

00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,460
can plug all these different sort of

00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,170
like wings onto it will you just stack

00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,940
them on top brick walls room was

00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,410
fantastic and he brought me this triple

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,240
ax which just means that I can have them

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,770
side by side but they're still connected

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,320
to each other like this stacked this is

00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:09,940
magical I didn't even know income by the

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,790
so this is a little screen here so my

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,350
aim is to use the browser to like send

00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,510
something to the screen and then that's

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,500
going to be our happy demo for today so

00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,940
I just wanted to show you this before

00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,170
you plug it in and then I'm actually

00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,400
going to go to my browser because

00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,910
hopefully you'll see that that

00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,470
notification comes up I can't find me

00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,120
there we go alright so I'm gonna plug

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,620
this into my computer and then I'll hold

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:38,559
this up later just to see if it actually

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:42,630
works let's see oh alright so that's

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:45,790
pretty small don't clap no no no no no

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:48,429
that's not the Corvette but anyway you

00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:51,460
see here it says feather 32-year for as

00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:52,960
i said go to web USB dot fragile doubt

00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,390
systems which is a domain name and that

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,920
I actually own it's meant for my demos

00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:01,210
that are really bad like this okay okay

00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:04,179
so my friend made this cool thing called

00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:07,470
Oh lead Jas designer and then I like

00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:10,690
fancied it up with a rainbow but I

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,760
although it would look like cool but I

00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:14,110
also like hacked it to work with web US

00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,850
base this previously didn't work with

00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,679
web USB you could just design stuff

00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,900
download it and then upload it to an

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,090
Arduino later so I'm gonna write

00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:27,970
something real quick I'm gonna try so

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:29,140
hard not to go over time hi Jay yeah

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,370
this is really cool you should go play

00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:34,260
with this just in general you know it's

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:38,830
like a pit ah'd but it's um for

00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,059
monochrome screens so hi Jas kampf looks

00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:43,540
terrible but I'm Russian

00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:45,190
alright um so technically that means

00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,920
that if we click connect

00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:51,390
and cross our fingers oh there we go so

00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,830
we have the LCD to you for right there

00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:55,809
we're going to try and connect to it I

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,220
don't see what happens oh I saw

00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:01,690
something it might actually work

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:05,830
okay so this is really hard to actually

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:09,220
do without kind of like losing the focus

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:10,900
of the the browser so let's see what we

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,880
can do huh

00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:16,840
I don't have DV running right now I sort

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:20,050
of shot a bunch of stuff beyond alright

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:25,840
so I'm gonna click send image

00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:27,670
and then that was not what I was

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,679
expecting to actually go wrong you know

00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:34,120
what I mean like okay so I did a weird

00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:35,679
thing where I go to cable stock I'm just

00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,300
gonna have to like redo this I'm so

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,740
sorry geez just just building the

00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:43,480
suspense you're welcome

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:45,790
okay so I have to like re refresh this

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,590
so okay so this is where I'm the second

00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,030
thing doesn't work so normally when you

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:52,440
want to kill Johnny Five this is what

00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:55,030
this is using you send just a control C

00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,540
how do you do that in the browser it's

00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:08,220
not it doesn't work at oh I lost my

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:08,220
screen I don't any minute now

00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:13,330
yeah okay

00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:16,090
I'm waiting for my confidence monitor

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:19,240
okay all right sorry oh my god I'm gonna

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:20,559
have to draw this again let's just

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,340
connect to it first huh

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,700
yep looks good to me hi this is gonna be

00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,700
worse

00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,500
crap I'm running out of time I'm so glad

00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:36,280
I didn't bring the other damn right now

00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:39,400
Jay s clump it's fine

00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:41,470
okay so we're gonna hold this up and

00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:49,200
then not screw up the AV the same Oh

00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:49,200
I've tangled it again okay we ready

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,890
that works surprisingly well and I feel

00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:08,510
like you clap louder than them so that

00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:11,419
that's good okay all right cool

00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:13,220
all right so that worked so that was

00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:15,169
literally seamless because there was

00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,120
just none of this fancy stuff like

00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:19,250
gluing it all together it was just like

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,510
look there was this impacts and I want

00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,070
to thank Louis for that because he wrote

00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,270
the kind of hack that got Johnny Five

00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,620
working with you web us because that's

00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,360
actually not even supposed to be a thing

00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,730
but he did really good at that so Thank

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,260
You Louis this is my other demo which

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,260
was oh yes like you Louis yes

00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:38,480
cos he's here today and he was doing the

00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,890
note copters yesterday who's awesome so

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,450
this is actually like what happens when

00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,130
you try and program that bad chip so

00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,750
this was the demo that actually worked

00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:47,210
that I shot in my hotel room so you can

00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,370
see there it read the program it got the

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,380
chip signature and each little hash you

00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:53,090
see that he's like one page of memory

00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,280
being written so I was able to even get

00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,660
like the oh okay I wrote that page I

00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,630
finished that page I finished this one

00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,740
so like you can like make an ID natively

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,360
in the browser now and you can like

00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,010
program microchips and stuff like I

00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,299
mentioned just going to your own going I

00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,620
don't know how to use this and like

00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:08,360
there's like drag drop scratch

00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,460
interfaces to like program these and

00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:14,090
like I just I just wanted to tell you

00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:16,760
how excited it was so yeah cool so demo

00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:18,710
number one was made with Web USB serial

00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,820
which was written by Lewis so yeah thank

00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,960
you so much for that because it's

00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:26,330
definitely a really cool hack

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,679
johnny-five was what I was using in

00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:30,080
order to like write to the screen

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,730
I wrote the module to that actually the

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,290
kind of like jaws pitches and and can

00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,380
send texts and stuff to the screen I

00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:38,210
also wrote PNG to LCD which allows me to

00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,500
also like upload bitmaps which I didn't

00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,840
have time to show you but you could like

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,890
upload pictures of cats and stuff and it

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,010
will convert it Rachel my friends did

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:50,809
oled Jeff's designer which is Blom and I

00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,370
used to with hack which was the weirdest

00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,960
thing ever to do for hardware I think I

00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,640
texted America and I was like I'm using

00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,590
webpack for hardware I don't like this

00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,510
world at all

00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:01,490
I thought I'd got away with it for a

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:04,010
while demo number two is made with a

00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,600
viago SDK 500 version 2 which is just

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,360
the protocol that the programmer speaks

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,250
that's part of my JavaScript hardware

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,039
repertoire I'm using a viago

00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:15,020
ISP Mach 2 which is the programmer so

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,270
those two together and what allows me to

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:19,070
speak it and I'm using webpack and I

00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:21,200
wrote that really bad code on a plane to

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,630
Australia a few months ago so I'm just

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,610
glad that it worked in the demo so

00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:33,860
futures before I run out of time current

00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:35,539
support let's talk about that sad so it

00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,840
really wants to quit but what's cool is

00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:40,370
that it works on Chrome for Android so I

00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,500
have this really cool device that's too

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,880
small to show up here but you can like

00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,309
if you can get one of those weird like

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,529
you know female USB to like male micro

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,539
USB you can like plug stuff into your

00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:53,059
phone and just start controlling lights

00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:55,070
and stuff so that's actually really cool

00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:58,429
right so I'm hoping that this is more

00:32:55,070 --> 00:33:00,169
green soon I work on myself so I'm

00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:01,940
working on it I'm like winking at the

00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:04,250
edge people and I'm giving them all of

00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:06,500
these Web USB devices but I'm not sure

00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,240
how much impact I'm having so please

00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,890
tell browser vendors that you want this

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,190
stuff please help me because I can't do

00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:14,360
this so why support this I feel like I

00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,549
did a pretty good job of kind of showing

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,770
that but again just a draw from the web

00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:20,750
USB spec this will be good for the web

00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,429
because instead of waiting for a new

00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,350
kind of device to be popular enough for

00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:27,020
browsers to provide a specific API which

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:28,669
is kind of what's happening now new and

00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,679
innovative hardware can be built from

00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:32,419
the web from day one that's pretty sweet

00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,059
you know you don't have to like wait for

00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:36,950
these things so like anything can be

00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:39,020
interfaced as long as it's just like a

00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,990
regular USB which is a lot of devices

00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:44,090
out there already so if you wanted to

00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,100
learn more definitely again highly

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:50,020
recommend that you check out the web USB

00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:52,760
spec it is hosted at the WCG github

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:56,059
repository and you organization you'll

00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,789
find that at web USB my Arduino the

00:33:56,059 --> 00:34:01,250
Arduino example will get you started so

00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:02,809
I sort of was doing similar things in

00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,730
that demo but I was using joining five

00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:07,340
on top of that so please check that out

00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,869
because it has step-by-step instructions

00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:11,690
on sort of how to implement your very

00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:13,099
first cool thing including like a web

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,450
page where you can just immediately run

00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:17,270
it and as long as you've uploaded the

00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:19,849
code to your Arduino it's good and my

00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,889
demo is at that address there but again

00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:24,320
it's like super shady code but yeah but

00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:25,340
hopefully you'll enjoy reading it so

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:36,059
thank you

00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:36,059
