[APPLAUSE] >> OK.

00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,410
I am going to put figment up here since I am too short for the podium anyway.

00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,500
Hi, everyone.

00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,430
I am here today to talk you on a journey into imagination.

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,870
I think my slides just cut out, though.

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,309
Can you confirm that?

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,960
There we go.

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,800
I am going to tell you a little about me.

00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:02,220
I am Rachel White and I am the developer experience lead at American Express which means it is

00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:09,450
my job to help improve the developer experience of learning and interacting with our APIs

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,780
internally.

00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:17,940
Helping to fix pipelines and make things easier for our developers, whether you are an internal

00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,770
employee, the one building those, or if you are an external partner, wanting to implement

00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,560
our stuff.

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:35,049
I am also on the community committee for node.js.

00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:44,840
Things like evangelism, internationalization, inclusive and there Node website.

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,979
I care a lot about the creative thought processes especially whether it comes to programming.

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,979
-- when.

00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:56,670
This is going to be a weird talk which is nothing new for me.

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,200
This one is a little more cute than weird.

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,030
As a little bit of background, I am so excited to use the sparkle transition.

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,950
I have never gotten to do that and felt like this was the perfect excuse to finally get

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,010
to do it.

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,170
This is me.

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,470
I don't know how old I am.

00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,620
Probably like under seven.

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,940
I don't understand children.

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,220
I have been to Disney over 50 times.

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,820
I grew up near Disney World and I have been going since before I could talk.

00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:34,180
I have old home videos of me as a baby and my aunt is holding me and she is like Rachel

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,680
look at mickey and my foot is in my mouth so...

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,170
The thing I really like about it is the immersive experience you have in the park and kind of

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,230
escape from reality it provided.

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:53,430
It was really thrilling and exciting to me and that probably correlates with my love

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,430
for tiki bars.

00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:01,170
I just like not being in the regular world.

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,220
Whenever I couldn't go to the park for a few years and I would visit again there would

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,650
always be something new to see.

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:16,520
I started thinking about the experiences that I had as child that helped shape me to who

00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,129
I am professionally and realize Disney is a big part of it.

00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:26,620
Yes, I love Disney world but I am going to tell you about the park I love even more.

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,560
And that is Epcot.

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,420
I fell in love with Epcot the first moment I can remember experiencing it which was in

00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,070
the late '80s.

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,960
Epcot stands for the experimental prototype community of tomorrow.

00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,769
There is two major parts of the park.

00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:52,220
The first one is the World Showcase and the next one is Future world.

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,340
Epcot is dedicated to the celebration of human achievement, mainly technological innovation

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,930
and international culture.

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,780
It is also often referred to as the world's fair.

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,319
The world's showcase has 11 sections representing different countries.

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,980
Most people know about the world showcase because it is one of the places that everybody

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,769
over 21 goes to get drunk in the Disney parks.

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:24,370
Future World is a variety of pavilions that explore innovative aspects and applications

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,500
including technology and science.

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,460
While I could go on forever about all of the things I love about the park in general we

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,470
are going to focus on one major part and that is the imagination pavilion which is my figment

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,270
is here and why I decided to match him.

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,539
The imagination pavilion has to deal with imagination.

00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:54,290
It was colorful and fun inside and encouraged kids to be creative and adults.

00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:01,890
Associated with the imagination pavilion is the dream finder, the non-dragon, and figment

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,330
who is the dragon.

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,940
The best part about the imagination pavilion was a section inside called image works.

00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,760
It lasted from 1982-1988.

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,530
Where was born at the end of 1985 so I am surprised that I can still remember some of

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,180
this.

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,060
There were things that you could interact with.

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,400
Like these step tones where guests could create music by stepping on the different light and

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,510
making different tones.

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,890
There was also this coloring book thing where you had paint brushes and you could paint

00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,970
the colors and it all filled it in with light.

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,910
There were giant touch pen tables.

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,080
You know, like those things you put your face into and all the little metal pins.

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,690
It sounds gross when you think about all the people touching it but it was really cool.

00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:02,570
It was really fun and encouraged you to, like, do things with technology but creatively.

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,659
Inside the imagination pavilion was a dark ride which is what the rides in Disney that

00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,250
are in the dark are called.

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,630
Who would have thought?

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,650
It was called journey into imagination and the inspiration for this talk is where I got

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,820
the name from.

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:23,360
This one lasted from 1983-1999 and in the ride the dream finder introduces himself and

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,570
says he uses the dream mobile to collect dreams and ideas to create all sorts of new things.

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,520
So then he creates a figment of his imagination and I wanted to show you some footage from

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,909
that ride I found from 1996 so you can experience the same thing I got to as a child because

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:45,640
this ride has had two other iterations after it and they are bad.

00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,320
They are really bad.

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,680
So enjoy this video.

00:06:49,680 --> 00:07:33,750
It is two minutes and 30 seconds.

00:07:33,750 --> 00:08:38,680
Here we go.

00:08:38,680 --> 00:09:23,900
[Playing video] >> So one thing this video also shows is that

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,400
people have been taking bad videos since before cellphones could except was really big and

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,580
on our shoulder.

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:36,460
THAFRT part -- after that part of the ride, you go through and explore a bunch of creative

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:42,520
applications and they talk about science and how scientists and astronauts and using your

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,840
creativity you can be whatever you want and how creativeness can apply to anything.

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
It doesn't just have to be the arts.

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,890
I was like that is awesome.

00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,950
The experiences I had as a kid with the imagination pavilion.

00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,460
There is me with their dream finder and figment.

00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,520
I am sure it isn't the same one.

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,890
They look a little different.

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:13,280
That led me to do a lot of research on the things I loved about the park.

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,770
So the blend of the education and the creative learning.

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,470
I wanted to know more about how they did it.

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:28,700
I started reading more about the imagineers and I found this quote from Disney.

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:46,170
We are always exploring and experimenting and call it Imagineering.

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:55,010
Imagineers are responsible for building Disney theme parks, resorts and cruise ships.

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:02,460
They do the rides but they also do the interior of the restaurants to the menu design.

00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,510
It is everything.

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,800
Everyone is an imagineer.

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:15,620
There is over 140 job titles including architectures, engineers, show writers, graphic designers.

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:22,320
All these multi-disciplinary people are using the same principles for when they create.

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,630
I read a few books and realized how perfect this is for what we do every day.

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,590
I know not everyone likes Disney and that is fine.

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,870
What I think is the most important thing is how successful and adaptable their model for

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,240
creating is and that is something to learn from.

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,510
Why apply this to software?

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:59,590
You are probably like OK, this is for a theme park and how can I possibly utilize this?

00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:16,740
From the time you in line they keep you captivated.

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,630
Wouldn't you want someone reading your documentation or going through your demos to feel engaged?

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,740
You don't want to lose their attention in the middle of the important things you are

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,529
telling them.

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:37,170
So basically all of the imagineers go by mickey's 10 commandments and they were created by Marty

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:49,800
similar and they were from his early learning in his 56-year career at Disney.

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,420
I think they are extremely helpful for our own processes.

00:12:53,420 --> 00:13:06,730
We talk a lot about strategic thinking or thinking more technical.

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:12,840
For each 10 commandments I will talk about Disney's reason behind it and how I feel week

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,050
utilize that with our own users and code.

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:26,370
Number one know your audience, wear your guest shoes, three is organize the flow of ideas,

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:35,100
four create a visual magnet, five communicate with visual literacy, six; avoid overload.

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Seven; tell one story at a time.

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,580
Eight; avoid contradictions and maintain identity.

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,630
Nine; for every ounce of treatment provide a ton of treat and the easy one to adapt to

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,290
programming is keep it up and maintain it.

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,610
Let's jump in.

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,570
For the first one, know your audience.

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:03,190
How you communicate and what you communicate is totally who you identify as your target

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,670
audience.

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,089
Disney started planning by going to other amusement parks with his daughter and sitting

00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:13,520
on a bench and observing what worked and what didn't.

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:20,280
He didn't start his vision for the parks without knowing who he was making it for.

00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,880
For us as engineers it is also important to know our audience.

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,990
More well-established projects, track metrics and behavior of users but that is people who

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,900
are using a product already.

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,230
What can we do to plan before we even write a piece of code?

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,010
If we have an idea for the end result, why don't we take a look at similar projects or

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,510
projects you aspire to be like?

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,180
How do the users interact?

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,130
What could you do better?

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:52,300
This could be something like what languages do they support or are we going to use npm

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,010
or Yarn?

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,150
Someone who does this fantastically, not someone, a project that does this fantastically is

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,110
NodeBot.

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:09,650
The way they cater for every skill level makes the process fun and engaging.

00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:14,240
If you don't know what you are doing, it is OK because they have documentation available

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,510
so you can find the pieces you need and piece it together to get what you need to get done.

00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,701
They are aware people using Nodebots are venturing into the hardware for the first time and make

00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:26,750
it easy to do that.

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:36,131
If you are more advance, they have a room where you can chat and harass them to get

00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:40,420
them to help you out -- not that I have ever done that.

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,220
Number two is wear your guest shoes.

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,230
Walt insisted every designer had to go to the park every week and stand in lines to

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,870
understand how the guests were experiencing it.

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,100
When writing your documentation, give it to somebody else to try.

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,100
See if it is written plainly enough and accessible to all levels.

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,850
Appeal to more than just the senior programmer.

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,560
The more open you are to all levels of skills enables more adoption for your project.

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,470
More people talk about it and encourage more to use it.

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:23,260
Earlier on in my career, I dealt with undocumented code basis and documents that were too hard

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:29,350
for me to use because there wasn't a level of thought and care put into it for the user.

00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:35,780
I have told myself I make sure anything I have my hand in making won't treat people

00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,589
the same since then.

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,170
So here is an example of that.

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,380
This is Webpack.

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,010
A poor example of this, in my opinion, is what Webpack has on their landing page.

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:53,030
It is a super important bundler a ton of people use but I can't tell you the amount of times

00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,300
I have heard programmers say I don't get it or it is too hard.

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,460
It is that simple as really not a great thing to say.

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,610
I gave a quick version of this talk at Brooklyn JS as in I spoke as quickly as I could to

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,419
fit it in 10 minutes and I went over.

00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:17,569
At the end of it, Jen came up to me and said Rachel stop being negative and reach out to

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,399
Sean Larkin and suggest to change it because that would be a better case study than coming

00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:25,699
up here saying Webpack is bad.

00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:30,740
I messaged him and he was pumped and totally chill about it.

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,080
He agreed with me.

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,790
They opened up a poll request and are workshopping a better title for that section.

00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,940
Don't be afraid to reach out to maintainers with suggestions for better language in the

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,340
project or suggestions for any kind of improvements.

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,670
You are helping them.

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,640
The next one is organize the flow of people and ideas.

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,179
So, the important part of this is good stories and experiences have logic and sequence that

00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,900
pay off for the time and effort that the users put in.

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,720
Put this care into your documentation.

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,990
Don't just give code samples and call it a day.

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,390
Craft an experience for the users.

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,380
Give them a backstory on what you are trying to achieve with the creation.

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:17,540
Give them all the instructions and tools you need before getting to the code.

00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,470
Include a section with a link to commonly encountered errors or issues that people have.

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,720
Each step along the way will step them up for success.

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,670
A company that does this fantastically is Twilio.

00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:33,100
When you sign up for their services, during the sign-up process they ask you what language

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:39,110
is your primary language and when you are done with the sign-up, the things you are

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,140
looking up are already there in the language you are looking for so you don't have to go

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,470
digging for it and that is great.

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,220
The next one is create a visual magnet.

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,150
Disney has visual magnets throughout the park and they draw you in from a distance to a

00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,790
specific part.

00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,790
The rocket ship in tomorrow land and space and earth in Epcot serve as a visual line

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,960
but a point of reference for park goers so you can coordinate meet up plans and everybody

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,290
knows what you are talking about.

00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:13,510
In programming one way you can do this is by being unique with your demos.

00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:18,970
Create something exciting for people to build while learning how to use your code.

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:25,810
It will definitely stick out more than giving them a generic hello world or a to-do list.

00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,910
Somebody that does this fantastically is Wes Boss.

00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:36,330
The React for beginners course you build a fun sea food inventory page.

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:42,220
It is fun, helps explain props and states and it is one of my favorite resources to

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,340
use whenever I need to go back and refresh React stuff which is all the time because

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,780
I have a terrible memory.

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:55,630
I can associate the things I learned with each step of the tutorial which is memorable

00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,940
and important.

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,000
The next one is communicate with visual literacy.

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,610
Imagineer use a ton of non-verbal ways to communicate.

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:13,230
Make sure you take advantage of the non-verbal tools you have at your command.

00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,460
How is your documentation?

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,190
Is it all sample code?

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,850
What could you do in order to improve the user's experience?

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,809
So many people coming into programming are coming from non-traditional computer science

00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:30,510
backgrounds or are changing their jobs later in life coming in as visual learners.

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:37,049
They need diagrams, drawings and cartoons to grasp concepts that might be new to them

00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:38,940
so use them.

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,460
And somebody who does this great is Lynn Clark.

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:50,660
Her code cartoons are helpful and explain a lot of concepts visually and it helps it

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:58,200
make sense versus reading an article about Redux which who wants to do that?

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,990
The next is avoid overload.

00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:09,190
When imagineers take on a new project the second task is to reduce everything to what

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,320
is important.

00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,520
You want a lot of information in your documentation but you need structure it well.

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,640
Don't have one long page going to all the information surrounding the API.

00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,770
Break it up into different parts.

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:30,150
One section to get started, another for API reference and another for code snip want -- snippets.

00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,630
Stripe does this well.

00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,670
You know where you need to go exactly where you need to go.

00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:45,100
They don't overload you with too much information at the get-go.

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,380
The next one is tell one story at a time.

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,559
Good stories are clear, logical and consistent.

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,640
Disney invented the story board in the 1930s which I didn't know about before I started

00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,220
the research.

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,200
The whole point is to create a story line that holds together from end to end.

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,830
It is to create a story they can review with anyone even if they are not involved in the

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,760
process and they will be able to understand it.

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,230
Story board your documentation as well.

00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,150
Think of where you want the user to start out and at the end what knowledge you want

00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,280
them to come out that they didn't have at the beginning.

00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,850
If it is just an API reference that is one thing.

00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,350
For something more technically written come up with a scenario and tell it that way.

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:35,780
Case studies and user stories are also a fantastic thing to use for this.

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,420
Was that a double slide?

00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,380
Sorry about that.

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,380
Wait.

00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,380
Storyboard.

00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,890
That was double.

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,309
OK.

00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:48,120
Sorry about that.

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,530
The next one is tell one story at a time which I should have taken for this talk because

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,630
I just got confused.

00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,990
Wait, no, I see what is happening.

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,110
That went double.

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,110
OK.

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,110
Here we go.

00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,110
Keynote.

00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,940
Listen, I worked on a Window machine for the last year and a half and I am getting used

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,640
to this again.

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,940
OK.

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
Here we go.

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,150
Somebody that does this really well is D3.

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:20,010
While not being the, like, cleanest of the presentation of examples they have a whole

00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:29,170
section of real-world implementations of D3 being used which is helpful.

00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,630
A lot of libraries don't take advantage of this.

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:37,070
It really is the easiest way to show someone implementations they can take and build off

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,940
to get started.

00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,790
A working example of code is better than snippets they can just piece together sometimes.

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,280
The next one is avoid contradictions.

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,420
The design details of Disney is friendly.

00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,830
Nothing is screaming out for attention.

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,160
The graphics are equal in representation.

00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,490
You know where you are.

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,650
The details make for a pleasant experience.

00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:10,510
So, leave out the details of wants and things that didn't work out in your documentation.

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,830
Keep only the positive messages.

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,490
Sometimes people explain hardships they explain while making something or something they didn't

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,890
get to.

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,070
Leave it out.

00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:28,280
Don't include negativity unless it is something you learned from and there is a lesson.

00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:44,330
No TO -- no to dos in read me.

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,490
Disney educates but they don't tell you they are doing so.

00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:54,169
They let you discover and learn while being surrounded by fun and excitement.

00:24:54,169 --> 00:25:01,130
I gave a talk last year at JSConf EU about learning how to program in sites before stack

00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,880
overflow and hacker news where they gamified knowledge sharing and how much more fun it

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
was then.

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,850
Try to go back to the feeling you had when you were first learning to code and try to

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:17,179
add that magic and fun into your project.

00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,600
Somebody who does this perfectly is sailor HG.

00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:29,900
Amy makes these super informative scenes about computer science through creative projects.

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,090
They are really engaging and keep you interested.

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:40,430
And the last, but probably the most important, commandment is keep it up, maintain it.

00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:45,920
Disney is spotless and since it is kept so clean the guests inherently keep it clean.

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,240
Not wanting to contribute trash to an otherwise nice-looking area.

00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:57,000
You are wanting to find the nearest trash can without thinking about it.

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,510
The rides are well maintained and that takes a ton of effort.

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:05,440
If everything wasn't functioning the way it intended it would not be the same Disney experience.

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,480
The same principles go for code.

00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:14,690
Maintain it, pay attention to the users, don't ignore poll requests.

00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:21,510
I know that is hard for a big project but try to keep it as the basis for everyone involved

00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:26,310
to check-in and see if there is people in there wanting to help.

00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,250
So, yeah, check these things.

00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,720
I am not saying what project this is for.

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,059
It is big.

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:40,320
Anyway... so basically what I am trying to say is a creative thinking process is beneficial

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,580
to technical material.

00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,270
It allows us to reach more people than it would if we stick to dry documentation with

00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,440
a lot of technical jargon.

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:57,500
Putting care into tracking users will make all potential projects better in the long

00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,770
run.

00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:08,390
This book, one little spark, is the inspiration for my talk.

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:12,880
It is really interesting if you want to check it out.

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,000
If you like what I had to say today or want to yell at me, I don't know, you can find

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,880
me a couple places I am ohhoe on Twitter and I have been streaming content on Twitter every

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,140
Monday and Friday at 4:00 p.m. pacific.

00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:38,220
I started with freecodecamp starting at the way at HTML and I will make my way all the

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:45,270
way to info stack and I am just streaming to try and show other developers that vulnerability

00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,270
is OK.

00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,700
I had a test go wrong trying to write a horizontal rule tag.

00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:58,330
I was like there is no way something is wrong and I had to search freecodecamp test broken

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:02,820
and I was right and I was like I knew the was right.

00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,570
I am also going to be creating fun videos on YouTube of programming and hardware for

00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,570
non-programmers.

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:17,210
I am calling both of these what the help because it is cute.

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:25,270
I am on Drip which is kick starters Patreon platform.

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,790
This was journey into imagination.

00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,080
I am Rachel White.

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
Thank you.

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,440
