[Music]

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,780
[Applause]

00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:25,270
[Music]

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,000
so a few years ago I was at the

00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,529
barbershop it was my first time in there

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,579
my first the only time there so their

00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,250
group of students over there waiting

00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:36,190
their turn and so I'm intensely focused

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,420
at the mirror it's gonna like this is

00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,149
trying to figure out like is he cutting

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,039
my hair right yes he is but in the midst

00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:43,570
of those buzzing I heard a group of

00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,000
students talking about college

00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,340
admissions Dartmouth Williams and all

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,890
these are the colleges and I'm thinking

00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,260
to myself whoa I went to this school I

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,300
could so help suggestions things to

00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,739
consider all this kind of advice I

00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,140
wanted to give and since now I'm just

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,910
like super excited like yes yes yes but

00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,390
then it dissipates because I'm thinking

00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,909
wait I don't know them they don't know

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,939
me yeah they got they still figured out

00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:12,270
on themselves so the haircuts done and

00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:15,820
as I'm walking out the barbershop I

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,650
freeze because all these memories come

00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,659
rushing in like when I was at a coffee

00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,729
shop and I saw someone with an effective

00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:24,010
JavaScript book or when I was at the

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,110
library and I saw someone with this ap

00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,970
computer science book in each one of

00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,280
those times I wanted to go up in them

00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,900
and say hey JavaScript that's awesome

00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,790
please what can I do can I do to help

00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,170
AP Computer Science data structures

00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,960
algorithms let's talk I'd love to talk

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,119
about those but I did it because I was

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,180
shy I was apprehensive a little bit

00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:45,430
embarrassed but I thought okay this has

00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,860
to stop somewhere so I turned back

00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,380
around introduce myself to the group of

00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,520
students and said hey I'm get it please

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,049
feel free to reach out for anything I

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,439
can do to help with the college

00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:58,930
application process etc a few weeks

00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,369
later one of them did reach out and that

00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,350
turned into this beautiful beautiful

00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:04,360
friendship he's now at the skov his

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:07,119
dreams pursuing pre-med on the path

00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,280
towards becoming a neurosurgeon so by

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,629
the way I didn't go back to the barber

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,250
shop and I figured hey I could actually

00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:14,860
probably just cut my hair myself and

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,189
then this happened and then I'm like

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,569
okay let me start going back again so my

00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:22,300
name is Geddes it rhymes with lettuce

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,440
one thang EJ is calm thank you all you

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,950
guys for just being here today I'm super

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,700
excited

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,340
it's

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,020
it's an honor to pleasure thank you I'm

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,150
a developer I assumes working with react

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,620
node and Java to build the better

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,410
recruiting experience for both job

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,240
seekers and employers it's overall just

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,710
surrounded by great people doing good

00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,460
work helping clients like Microsoft

00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:45,700
Amazon 7-eleven South that the Airlines

00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:48,070
Boys and Girls Club overall a blast but

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,030
really at the barbershop why did I have

00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:55,420
to do that did I have to not really but

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,310
I wanted to and it was because deep in

00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,800
my heart I know that I wouldn't be here

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,150
today without my mentors I wouldn't have

00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,190
majored in computer science had I not

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,080
been from my mentors nor would I even be

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,810
the developer that I am today had it not

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,239
been for my mentors their encouragement

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,580
their resources their guidance they were

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,040
highly highly highly invaluable and

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,690
important to my life but more so what

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,450
they really taught me was just that a

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,300
candle loses nothing by lighting another

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,270
candle you know I believe that for our

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,980
community to be more inclusive more

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,500
collaborative and even more innovative

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,150
we need more mentorship and now there is

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,980
good progress being made already with

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,200
formal programs like when you're a new

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,120
hire or you're an intern and you meet

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,620
with someone on a regular basis I think

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,920
those are great and it's really good

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,750
progress that said I'm not here to talk

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,190
about that kind of mentorship I'm here

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,330
to talk about a mentorship that is more

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:51,610
organic it's more fluid but that said

00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,530
there are some obstacles with mentorship

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,930
obstacles that I myself experienced

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,100
greatly so by raise of hands raise your

00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,510
hands if you think if you consider

00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,280
yourself a mentor or if you're like me I

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,480
do like the little halfsie hand or do

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,200
like a quick when I'm quick bring it

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,810
back down and the thing is at first I

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,540
didn't consider myself a mentor for many

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:14,160
reasons one I'm like I don't have the

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:16,540
time to I'm not part of a formal program

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,930
nor do I even really consider myself a

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,519
quote/unquote expert and frankly I was

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,950
it was quite intimidating I'm like those

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,320
are some big shoes to fill I mean one

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:29,229
what if I'm giving the wrong advice or

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,490
maybe I'm giving too much advice or if

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:32,830
you really want to get to the crux of it

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,140
it was more of like I'm actually pretty

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,500
good why do I even need to or have to

00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,500
help

00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,669
but mentorship is important and it's a

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,740
few reasons one of them helps them you

00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,729
know imagine the fulfillment knowing

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,330
that you helped someone with their

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:51,469
career even if it's a teeny tiny bit or

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,259
what if you helped provide one of those

00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:56,449
aha moments with the tool or framework

00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,740
or a concept I still remember when

00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:00,050
someone explained the whole redoubts

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,300
flux architecture to me like oh okay I

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,560
see that's how that works I mean I will

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,180
never forget that day because for the

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,939
longest I was like I don't know what I'm

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:11,449
doing here but then it clicked

00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,930
at the same time mentorship helps us as

00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,210
well

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,009
it's by paying it forward we benefit in

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,490
different ways you know it's been times

00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:21,770
I remember so I was explaining the

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,060
JavaScript develop to someone and he

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,770
kept asking these questions it was this

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,500
back and forth then before I know it I

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,849
realized wow I don't know they said ah I

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,979
do not know this you've been looped at

00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:32,449
all which forced me to go out and go

00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:34,400
find some videos on how that literally

00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:37,249
works there's been other times we're

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,080
just hearing people's life experiences

00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:42,169
their perspectives on life has only made

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:46,069
my own worldview that much more dynamic

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:47,900
and richer but more so I mean you get to

00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:49,250
make new friends a new ally and the

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,379
supporter we're just helping one another

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,560
we reach your own goals and your dreams

00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:56,449
all that good stuff but more so I'm a

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,060
big believer that are certain feelings

00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,740
and there are certain experiences that

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,509
money you really can't buy you could buy

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,949
a lot of really good things but it can't

00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:06,669
buy certain experiences and feelings

00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:09,110
that really only mentorship can provide

00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:11,389
and more so it just helps the community

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,149
I'm a big believer that what we put in

00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:16,550
we get out it's about raising these

00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:19,219
waters so that we're all uplifted

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,460
together more collaborative more

00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:24,080
innovative more inclusive and it's more

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,279
so it's like this ripple effect it's

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,409
this ripple effect where you affect

00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,120
someone and they affect another and they

00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:31,729
affect another it's like a boomerang or

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,069
it's just like until before you know

00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,870
just like it just comes back with that

00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:39,740
helping return from nowhere or you won't

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:42,050
even have expected it growing up there's

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,210
a lot of things I wanted to do but one

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,889
of my goals is always to really make an

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,589
impact on this world how can I make the

00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:50,180
world a better place and well I still

00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:51,300
haven't come up with that solution that

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,120
would affect

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,690
millions tens of millions hundreds of

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,159
millions this quote the fact that maybe

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,190
to the world I may just be one person

00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:03,780
but to one person I may be the world it

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,849
makes me realize that even if it's just

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,770
one person I'm affecting today I mean

00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:10,289
that's to me that's that's key and

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,840
that's important and you know throughout

00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:15,240
the course of my life I will forget many

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,110
many many things and I've already

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,940
forgotten many already

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,259
I've forgotten many names Africa and all

00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,860
the places of all out of you people work

00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:24,719
at but the things I will always remember

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:28,289
are those who help me those stick with

00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:30,509
me so this is a mentorship I'm trying to

00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:33,240
talk about people need your help and you

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:35,430
can help them you want to help them and

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,930
more so it also benefits you as well and

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,669
the thing is it doesn't have to be

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,740
stressful it doesn't have to be

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:43,500
complicated it doesn't even have to be

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,530
so involved it's more about a mentorship

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,969
it's organic it's fluid to me it's

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,360
really more about sharing what you can

00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:56,669
when you can

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,319
and how you can mentorship is like

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:00,060
walking through a garden with the

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,380
watering jug and so you're walking

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,389
through a guarding and sure you can

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:07,080
choose one plant and come every morning

00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:08,819
to water it or you can pick and choose

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,099
walking through this garden here's some

00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,229
for you here's some for you oh here's a

00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,759
lot for you and you just pick and choose

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:17,430
you can go the whole morning you can

00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,080
spend the entire day in fact you could

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,139
go to a different garden altogether next

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,300
time and the thing is if you think it's

00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:27,300
a good thing just do it you don't have

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,490
to rationalize justify a reason about it

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,620
just go ahead and do it as long as

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,209
they're genuine sincere and honest

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,310
intentions to try to better someone's

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:40,079
life I'm a big believer that just dive

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:41,969
in so going back on this idea what would

00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:43,529
you actually share as a mentor you know

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,410
how can I do this if I'm not a

00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,730
quote/unquote expert and that's the

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,930
thing you don't need to be and the

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,320
things you even share don't even have to

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:54,660
be related to tech you know what if you

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,779
could condense what took you five years

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,670
to figure out and package that and share

00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,980
with someone else so that they also

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,290
don't have to spend five years as well

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,690
you know it could be about knowledge and

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,490
experiences you know one of my favorite

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,980
things I've done this entire year was

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,040
just speaking at organizations like Rosa

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,400
code sharing my experiences in how in my

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,190
journey the tech I used to ask myself do

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,930
I belong am I good enough am i

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:26,430
passionate enough I really like this

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:29,190
field and hearing their responses you

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,200
know those eyes lit up high school

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,940
junior and senior girl just talked

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,800
telling me stories of how they also felt

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,420
the same way and how they were relieved

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,040
that they weren't the only ones feeling

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,490
this way I mean to me I was like nah

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,170
just give me the one fuzzies and the

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,200
thing is perhaps you know the thing

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:49,050
about a framework or to service three

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,060
dogs all different kinds of things maybe

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,590
you can share that or maybe you can talk

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,510
about the obstacles you faced on your

00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,340
journey to here and tell them about hey

00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,140
watch out for that tree why don't you

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,380
make a left on that turn you don't want

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,850
to go that way go this way instead the

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,670
type of advice you give could also be

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,220
both general or specific I myself I

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,720
personally enjoy talking about though I

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,760
personally do mentoring those who are

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,590
both entering or switching to the tech

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,140
industry and also about applying

00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,400
psychology to our daily day but on the

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,710
other hand I have a friend who just oh

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,630
man he just you could talk for hours and

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,310
hours and hours on end about

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,020
surveillance architecture and Lando's

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,240
and all of that so if you want that kind

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,890
of you just go to him I have another

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,690
friend on the other hand who just who

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,130
really makes yourself available to new

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,960
joiners when they're learning the code

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,540
base so there's different ways we can do

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,460
it perhaps you were a developer and now

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,590
you're a manager you can give that kind

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:44,850
of advice your experiences or your now

00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:46,350
you're a dev from to a team lead more so

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,180
I mean I even saw someone tweeting about

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:52,410
performance reviews and advice that

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,990
consider when that time comes you know

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,320
I'm a big believer and for a long time I

00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,670
used to underestimate the power of

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,250
encouragement and active listening and

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,480
frankly just being there for someone you

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,900
know several months ago I was helping

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,190
someone apply to some jobs and she was

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,140
very apprehensive because she thought

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,990
her background in music would be looked

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,970
down upon and I was talking to her and

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,830
we brainstorm ways and how to remedy

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,150
that

00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,950
they threw a cover letter and all of

00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,660
that and but more stuff was reminding

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,850
her that her skill spoke for themselves

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,300
and that she was in fact a really really

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,520
good developer but more so what I was

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,510
really doing was just listening

00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,640
providing encouragement and helping

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,560
build their confidence today

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,210
I mean she's happily employed at this

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,650
company's Innovation Lab doing great

00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:42,140
things or you can share connections and

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,370
questions you know there was another

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,050
time where I was reached out about

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,540
advice between deciding two job offers

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:51,590
do I take this one or did I take this

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,540
one and he's like okay you know these

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,220
are the pros and cons for Company A but

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,600
at the same time Company B has these

00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,400
kind of things I don't know I don't know

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,560
get it what do you think as I'm thinking

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,290
like wait actually I think I know

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,450
someone that company a so said okay give

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,250
me give me like ten minutes call the

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,660
friendly hey do you actually have

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,630
someone who's thinking about joining

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,250
that company used to work there can you

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,270
you know give your your feedback your

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,450
advice on what you thought about the

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,260
company and so connected them both and

00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,380
the rest is history

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,790
other times connections are just

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,960
resources themselves

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,150
there's been times where I've been

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,130
shared a certain book assert an article

00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,510
a certain video that had quite the

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,640
impact I'm I like that frankly when I

00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:33,110
google something there's so many like

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,550
how do I even pick and choose but when

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,550
someone can say actually ignore these

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:42,230
start with this one first that's big big

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:45,290
big big help now going back to when you

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:48,710
can you know we have families we have

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:51,050
friends responsibilities we have so many

00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,920
other hobbies and interests as well how

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,660
do you actually fit mentorship into this

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,060
and that's the thing mentorship doesn't

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,040
have to be time-consuming it's an

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,710
ongoing process where frankly you're

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:08,750
just aware of one you can help and then

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:10,220
you do it for example a while back I

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,690
have a lot of interest I like business I

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,290
like psychology I like tech I like

00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:17,630
people and I emailed in alumnus for

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:20,030
advice career advice and now he's a busy

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,400
guy he's a co-founder of this a startup

00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,990
out in Boston and I'm like I don't know

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,220
if he's ever gonna reply but let me try

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,120
and he did and this email had follow-up

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,700
questions his

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,240
some shins insights things to consider

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:38,420
it was this long and the thing is we

00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,830
never had a phone call never met in

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:45,380
person but that email had an impact and

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:48,100
it's because time isn't equal you know I

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:52,220
estimate that it took him about one hour

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:55,760
to write that email but on my end that

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,960
email easily easily save me about a few

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,970
weeks worth the time in terms of things

00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,040
to consider what to research so on and

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:05,390
so forth and it's the same with

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,510
mentorship other times I think about you

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:10,970
know sometimes I have a busy week

00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,710
sometimes I do not and so the weeks

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,060
where I have less time I leverage more

00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:18,260
asynchronous forms of you can

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:20,930
communication email slack message boards

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,150
all of those other times when I have

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,010
more time then I go into Ashley yeah

00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,589
please let's grab a phone call it's meet

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:31,550
in person or let's have a video chat

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:33,050
just staying flexible and adaptable but

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,120
really what I want to emphasize is

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,640
mentorship in whatever way you can

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,370
that's best for you that you feel most

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,920
comfortable with you know I am not

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:46,240
advocating nor saying that you should go

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,890
out and go find the mentee and say okay

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,360
for the next eight weeks every Wednesday

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,350
at 6 p.m. we're gonna meet and we're

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,730
gonna talk you're going to talk about

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,830
life and your career goals I'm not

00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,980
saying to do that you can if you want to

00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:01,580
but you don't have to it's more about

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,580
taking it one conversation at a time you

00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,529
know maybe you like to write blog posts

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,720
maybe you like to stream maybe videos

00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:12,200
maybe you like to speak at events those

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,940
are all good and the thing is it doesn't

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,190
really have to be about your job either

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,260
you know I have a friend who just E is

00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,490
an avid guitarist any anyone who wants

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,690
to learn guitar he's like please send

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,600
them my way I just want to you know

00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,040
teach amount of strum and all of that

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,000
he's a great he's a great engineer but

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,200
he doesn't like talking about that he

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,320
likes talk about the guitar and music

00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:35,270
and the thing is really you open

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,520
yourself up for future conversations you

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,520
answer just one one single question you

00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,780
leave the door open so that they can

00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,900
follow up or maybe they don't and

00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:48,180
right and regarding actual mentorship

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,950
you can happen anywhere anywhere and

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,680
everywhere it could be in your

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:55,680
organization it can be in your local

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,420
communities it can be even online you

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,980
know you remember one of my favorite

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,830
things I was going through Cora and

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,930
stackoverflow and someone asked if I

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,090
don't understand bubble sore if I don't

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,670
understand some sort of sorting or

00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,830
common algorithm am i cut out to be an

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,050
engineer and just searing the

00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:15,660
overwhelming support of people saying no

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,700
no no please no that's you can don't

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,160
don't no don't stop keep at it

00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,900
just work it it'll come but then I think

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,580
about what about the flip side what if

00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,930
people said oh yes please you got to

00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,480
stop you just get out of the industry

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,670
that would have been heartbreaking but

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,610
seeing that support online was both uh

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,650
it was it was fantastic

00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,840
at the same time I there is there's a

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,030
person in my company now whenever

00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,040
there's a new joiner he actively goes

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,590
out of his way to say hey let's grab a

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,420
coffee let me take you out to lunch let

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,670
me actually meet let me connect you with

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,940
someone else so it can just happen

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:53,930
anywhere and everywhere so the thing is

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:58,470
where do you actually find mentees

00:16:53,930 --> 00:17:00,440
there's two ways I go to them and so one

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,610
of the best ten dollars I've ever spent

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,380
around these business cards they were

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,390
simple nothing flashy essentially they

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,750
just had my name and my email address

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,700
and so then I go to meetups or events

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,500
you know I talk and then afterwards like

00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:18,600
hey by the way here's my card please

00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,730
feel free to reach out so us it was

00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,410
inspired because you know a friend was

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,890
telling me sometimes it's not that we

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,210
don't want to reach out it's not that we

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,730
don't want to put in the work it's

00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:31,530
sometimes we're shy or were embarrassed

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,110
or were uncomfortable or we don't know

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,700
who to reach out to and so I mobility

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,740
I'm a believer that we can actually take

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:41,040
that first step and take that initiative

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,510
so whether it's contacting your own alma

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,220
mater Zoar schools whether it's your

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,650
middle schools high schools colleges

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,090
coding boot camps they would love to

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,590
have people come in and talk to the

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,690
students like this is me this is where I

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,830
came from these are my stories these are

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,240
my experiences these are the really

00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,220
really cool things that I get to build

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,809
now at

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,600
same time there's organizations like

00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:01,919
tech job store code 2040 girls who code

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,750
all just different kinds of

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,809
organizations who are desperately

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,880
desperately in need of people with your

00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:10,470
talent with your experiences who could

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,330
just share stories and they don't have

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,159
to be these formal commitments it could

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:18,440
just be one time and that's more than

00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:21,120
enough for people to see and believe or

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,730
instead you can take this approach of

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,289
like a lighthouse and you're out there

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,150
and you're kind of just like hey I'm

00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:30,510
over here please if you want to reach

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:34,080
out email me and so whether so for

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:37,440
example I have it on my my LinkedIn

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,760
summary my Twitter bio it's just a

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,250
little note that says and on my personal

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,940
site hey if there's anything I can do to

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,080
help you please reach out so at the same

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,789
time I know some of you are fairly

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,730
fairly fairly famous in the whole

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,809
Twitter community so for those with

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,090
large followings there are ways to

00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:56,880
mitigate that with email aliases and

00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:59,190
filters as well but more so again I was

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,289
told that sometimes people don't know

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:04,080
who to reach out to and again they don't

00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:06,480
want to come off as rude or intrusive or

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,340
as a little too forward just helping

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,380
them know like hey I am actually a

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,370
fellow Ally I'm a fellow supporter

00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:16,830
please reach out to me more so what this

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:20,909
really is it's it's a it's a communal

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:23,760
effort it's it's about how can we as a

00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:25,409
community redefine and rethink what

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,059
mentorship is again I think the former

00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:28,830
programs are really great but it's more

00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:31,740
about how can we make it more organic

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,720
and more fluid and so after this talk

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,820
I'll be sharing this repo in this online

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,659
document that has tools it has

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,850
techniques

00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:41,549
it has strategies and these really

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,380
contain actionable steps and all of that

00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:44,820
so that you can get started and adding

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,549
more of a framework and more like step

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,159
by step guide but really this this is

00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:51,960
that's just my thinking and that's a few

00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:54,450
others thinking this really should be a

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,500
mind share a collective of every one of

00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:00,450
what the community embodies so please

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,880
feel free to make a pull request or send

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,559
me a message and I'll add it myself it's

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,330
really just talking about hey actually

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,140
these are things to consider these are

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,580
some edge cases these are some outliers

00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,260
this should this could be a one-stop

00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,820
shop for those who think wow I really

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,040
can't mentor it but I really want to

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,510
deep down but but then I'm like no it's

00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,970
about minimizing that barrier to entry

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,980
so people can and go out and a ripple

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,110
effect

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,790
granted I do acknowledge that mentorship

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,800
is a two-way street it's not just the

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:30,560
whole onus and responsibility isn't just

00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,960
on us there is responsibility on the

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,060
mentee themselves granted that's

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,500
probably a whole blog post in the talk

00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,810
for another day but for right now this

00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,910
is more about the mentorship part and

00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:43,010
what I asked right now as a call to

00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,320
action of sorts to take this brief

00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,880
minute whether it's your phone whether

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,550
it's your laptop a piece of paper and

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,070
right now opening up your calendar your

00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,990
Notes app anything really and adding a

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,120
note whether it's 15 minutes whether

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:58,460
it's a half hour even five minutes to

00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,840
think about mentorship so right now I'm

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,160
gonna do it and I hope you guys join me

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,650
as well so I don't forget but whether

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,440
it's next week whether it's tomorrow and

00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,910
then not tomorrow next week I don't know

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,500
just so you remember what to do whether

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,510
to visit this repo or to reach out to

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,430
someone like hey anything I can do to

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:17,170
help it could be as simple as that so

00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,170
let me do it right now as well

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,790

everyone really for taking that time out

00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:30,899
and you know I'm a big believer that we

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,840
are like clay you know we're being

00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:36,419
molded being molded by our experiences

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,520
by our environment by other people

00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:41,520
you know let's say someone wants to

00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,529
become an airplane you know when it's

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,500
your turn help add one of those wings

00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:49,080
help add one of the fins a thruster a

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,360
turbine but don't make them a boat you

00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,340
know we have different destinations we

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,620
have different end goals help them

00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,539
accomplish theirs and it's really

00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,340
embedding into our I think we really do

00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:01,320
a good job of helping one another that I

00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,899
must say I think we are a fun bunch

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,210
helpful bunch that said I think we can

00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:08,850
always keep raising the bar for this

00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:10,260
community be known as so collaborative

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,940
