00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:34,270
hello everyone I'm fantastic and I am a

00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,160
grifter I want to welcome you to

00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,260
grifters Anonymous thank you for coming

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,579
to this meeting a surprising showing

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:46,150
actually so I'm happy to see that I know

00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:48,010
that there's a j/s meetup in town so

00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,230
this is not that we're gonna talk about

00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:54,400
stealing things from people who can

00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:58,510
afford to lose them so my grifter story

00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,730
starts in 2011 I was working at a small

00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:05,049
three-person company the three people

00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:07,720
were my dad Doug and myself I was doing

00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:11,770
accounting business management type

00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:14,170
stuff and I was right around the kind of

00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:19,049
crash of the American economy

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:22,659
and our business was going down and I

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,860
thought well you know for sure I'm gonna

00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:27,369
have a problem I'm gonna have to find a

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:30,520
new job but surely I won't go out get

00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:33,549
laid off before Doug right to my

00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,869
surprise and disappointment I did and if

00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:39,670
you've never been laid off by your

00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:45,280
father before Doug it's an emotionally

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:46,750
distressing experience so um it was

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,960
followed by another emotionally stressed

00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:52,090
Express another emotional experience was

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,460
I found out that I had spent all this

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,250
time working on my my dad's company and

00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:01,119
I was at this point unemployable

00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:03,400
effectively I had some good business

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,650
experience but not a lot of great

00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,200
business experience and this was at a

00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,420
time where people with master's degrees

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,400
and finances were getting kind of

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,760
swooped up for like a quarter on the

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,670
dollar in terms of salary so this was a

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,780
this was a bad time for me I had been on

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,459
unemployment for about six months and I

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,910
started to think seriously about what

00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,930
else

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:32,890
I might be able to do and so got a new

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:35,320
slide up so this was all the time that I

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:39,370
had heard that anyone can code as the

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,860
rat says here and I thought well maybe

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,950
maybe I could maybe it could I had a

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:48,010
very bad experience with code in middle

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:51,460
school I took one computer science class

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:54,310
where we learned like C++ and Java

00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,470
I say learned they learned stuff I

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,380
cheated the whole time

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,630
I just took I just bribed my fellow

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,910
students and I took their Tower of Hanoi

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,040
problems and then just kind of renamed

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,010
the variables and submitted them as my

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,400
own but it all came to a head when our

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,830
final project was this blackjack app and

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,050
I had an C I had created it in such way

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,260
where I didn't implement any logic in

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,450
terms of hitting or standing I just

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,220
looked at the users hand and decided

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,760
whether or not I was going to hit or

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,100
stand based on how close they were to 21

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,250
my teacher did not find this interesting

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,790
or amusing it at least and I said you

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,290
know I'm a pragmatist so I can I do so

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:42,070
good question real quick question for

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,360
you who has lied on a resume now I want

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,890
you to be super honest I want you to

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,350
kind of like think for a little bit like

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:51,220
no one hopefully no one who hired you is

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:55,720
here so who has lied at some point on a

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:58,080
resume okay that's not enough hands I

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,020
think some of you were lying right now

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,920
I'm gonna define lying a little bit I'm

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,130
putting something on your resume that

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:10,630
you have not actually like gotten paid

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:13,239
to to do so like if I put Oh camel on my

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,590
resume I I might be inclined to because

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,570
I'm played with it but like I haven't

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:21,190
gotten like paid to do it my resume is

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:23,260
full of that so I want to tell you

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,140
a little bit about a little story about

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,730
how I kind of like came into programming

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,419
this is gonna be a lot of stories very

00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:35,080
shy on the code so um I hope not to

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:36,700
disappoint you when so I was coming off

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,539
the six months of unemployment and I was

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,409
desperate

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:40,989
I had

00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:42,459
I had just been married so I'd been

00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:45,099
married for a little bit but I had a

00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:47,019
wife at a mortgage I had a brand-new kid

00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:50,830
and I was like freaking the hell out

00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:52,149
like what am I gonna do and so I thought

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,849
okay so I'm gonna try to figure out this

00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:56,289
code thing and I've been working from

00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:58,569
time to time to try to learn some new

00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:00,699
things and then I went for my first kind

00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:02,979
of like big pants job where I was gonna

00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:06,729
go get paid a salary to work as a

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:09,279
developer it was kind of entry-level so

00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,959
is HTML CSS and this proprietary

00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,089
language they were gonna teach me so

00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,360
this is perfect it's perfect for me and

00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:18,669
I went for it with a friend of mine who

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,629
happened to me I'm better qualified than

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:21,879
me

00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:24,550
had more experience than me better

00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,959
experience there were a couple rules so

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,969
I thought well maybe we'll both get it

00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:32,619
he'll definitely get it but I'll maybe

00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:33,999
I'll get it too he didn't get it and we

00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:36,669
started to kind of like process us

00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:39,669
through I was like what like why like

00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,019
why is it that I got this and you didn't

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,019
and so we started talking about this and

00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:47,139
it came down to came down to a t-shirt I

00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:48,219
said okay so so what did you wear to

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,509
this interview how do you how do you

00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:50,829
like prepare would you prepare because

00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:52,419
I'd been like going to meetups trying to

00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:55,929
figure out like how nerds talk and stuff

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:58,539
like that and and and he's like well you

00:05:55,929 --> 00:06:01,779
know like I I shaved my shaved my beard

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:03,990
I got a nice haircut and I wore a suit I

00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:06,339
was like oh no dude you did it all wrong

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,149
it was like I went into that meeting not

00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,249
knowing

00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:12,489
but like I just wore converse jeans and

00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:17,769
a t-shirt and like I I named that

00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:20,829
culture fit and this became like a cheat

00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:23,979
code for me I realized that so much of

00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:29,439
like being hireable in tech right now is

00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:32,379
like looking and fitting the part now

00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,209
this kind of like came came came to bite

00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:37,509
me but one of the things that I learned

00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:41,919
early on is that the kind of main export

00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:44,199
of a tech nerd is pedantry you just have

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,459
to give a about something that

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:51,279
nobody else cares about so like tabs

00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:52,090
versus spaces right like it doesn't

00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,480
matter

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,370
at all um but it's something that we

00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,560
care deeply about we want to like make

00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,900
sure that like our underdog opinion is

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,169
like validated even though both seem to

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,540
be the underdog opinion

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:10,060
now as I invested in my kind of sense of

00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:15,250
pedantry I kind of made I made one

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:17,230
little misstep I my wife it was her

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,910
birthday and it was like kind of like a

00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,610
week of and she's telling me like you

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,050
know I want to do is it's like have

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,120
Girl's Day and we're gonna like you can

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,000
move the TV you know put it on this like

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,690
you know vanity well watch Gilmore Girls

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,650
all day and there was like it's like

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,850
like I knew that I had kind of like

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,100
leveled up because there was this like

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,470
block right here and like this this

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,810
request very like a simple honest great

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:44,800
request I came in and I just deflected

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:48,550
it I saw it fall to the ground I said I

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,500
said you know the structural integrity

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,139
of that vanity seems really questionable

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,919
there's no way it's gonna hold our 60

00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:58,720
pound TV she like this rage started to

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,060
like just come up in here she's like get

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,960
out of my house like I did not marry one

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,729
of those Big Bang Theory nerds and so

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,620
what part of me was like oh man like I'm

00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:16,000
super sad I disappointed my wife well

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:17,890
then the other half is like yeah and so

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,960
then but I mean it gets worse because

00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,100
then I'm like like well actually like

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,050
that's kind of a misconception because

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,300
like Big Bang Theory nerds you're like a

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,850
bad depiction of science nerds and I'm

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:32,409
more like a HBO Silicon Valley a nerd so

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:36,940
does that change how you feel at all it

00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:38,770
did not so what I've learned from my

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,820
experience over the years is the more is

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:46,300
caught than taught and bad habits spread

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,520
pretty quickly and I learned this as I

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:52,540
was kind of making that transition into

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,160
being a more senior engineer and really

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,990
what that comes down to is like now

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,089
instead of like kind of just having like

00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,910
a bunch of opinions about and being able

00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:02,560
to do like base level tasks kind of like

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,180
think more globally about your

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,399
applications and the products that

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,620
you're working on

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,490
and it came to a head as I was watching

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:17,390
Netflix's chef's table episode of Dan

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:19,670
barber know this man is an amazing chef

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,560
absolutely incredible and he's really

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,660
more of like a food philosopher than

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,570
anything else I definitely definitely

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,300
recommend watching this episode he's

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:32,329
very like soft-spoken thoughtful poetic

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,730
about his his work he's doing amazing

00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:37,010
things he has his own farm and they're

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:42,290
really investing in like kind of how we

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:43,670
think and work with food now he's really

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,320
amazing you're watching the first like

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,029
maybe 10 minutes of this episode you're

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,209
thinking wow what an incredible person

00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:52,010
like I thought all chefs were

00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:54,320
and then they show footage of him in the

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:58,279
kitchen and he like every other chef is

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,930
a monster just like I mean just one of

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,779
the worst that I've ever seen just a

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,700
total train wreck in the kitchen

00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:06,230
so as good documentarians they asked him

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,230
they say you know we're talking to this

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:12,020
guy and he's super like sweet thoughtful

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,430
nice poetic and then on the other hand

00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,270
like we see you in the kitchen and you

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:19,970
were just a beast I need he kind of sits

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:22,520
back thoughtfully for a second and says

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:27,110
you know the way I'm in the kitchen is

00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,579
abhorrent but that's how I learned you

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,170
know from the people who mentored me and

00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:32,899
that's how they learned from the people

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,959
that mentored them and I don't know how

00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:37,910
to do any different and I was just I was

00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:42,130
just weeping as I was watching this

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:46,610
because I was like it me it me I feel it

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:49,970
and I think that's so often in this

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,430
industry we front with certainty we want

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,190
to feel smart and to feel like we know

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,589
the answers and to be certain about the

00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,570
things that are ahead of us this is how

00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:01,490
we nail job interviews this is how we

00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:06,589
you know continue to progress in our

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:09,199
career etc and we use this certainty as

00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:11,149
a cheat code we love to find like best

00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:14,270
practices and patterns that we can use

00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:17,470
and apply this allows us to like feel

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:19,250
really smart in a lot of situations

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,190
unfortunately in my

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,230
case and meant that skill was outpacing

00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,950
experience I had a lot of opinions on

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:30,640
things that I had not actually earned

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:33,410
experience in and this is problematic

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,680
now I'm about to offend maybe half of

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,930
you this is a lot like religion my early

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,690
religious experiences were were such

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,540
that I grew up Baptist and there was

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,490
such that everything was a sin or on the

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,900
front steps of a sin and the only way

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,760
that you could make it to heaven was to

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,820
never even get close to anything that

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,010
kind of looked like a sin but if you if

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,810
you were successful in that then like it

00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,740
was like guarantee you were like you

00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,740
were gonna go no problem

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:06,980
now I'm gonna offend the other half of

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:09,080
you um I think that all of us in this

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:12,260
tech field are religious about something

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,810
so maybe you were atheist agnostic not

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:18,170
not religious at all I think that we as

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:20,960
a culture have very strong and religious

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:24,110
opinions about the way that we develop a

00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,700
code the way that we write it and the

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,260
way that we treat people when they don't

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,470
write it the way that we think it should

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,480
be written and lately we've been

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,880
starting to teach this to our robots

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,339
so now you can have blazing fast

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:42,710
religious criticism right into your

00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:44,510
editor and as religious organizations

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,370
we're always on the hunt for a villain

00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,230
we always want to find the bad thing

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:52,280
that's kind of caught the source of all

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,930
of our problems and never is it internal

00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,120
we never look inside we say that it's

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:59,089
the customer the p.m. the owner of the

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,010
company the stakeholders we always want

00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:02,660
to look externally that they're the

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,839
problem all of these unpredictable

00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,670
sources of change that's what that's the

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,830
problem with our app if we could just be

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,290
certain and know exactly how we're

00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,770
moving forward then everything would be

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,510
great

00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:20,900
that's not how applications work so I

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:23,450
want to tell you right now it's okay to

00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,910
be uncertain whatever level of

00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,920
experience you're at it's okay to be

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,080
uncertain

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,100
honestly the greatest leaps in my career

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,070
have been

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,449
when I walked into uncertainty not

00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,310
knowing what the answer was going to be

00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:41,870
and kind of figured it out as I went

00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:43,550
along there are no Universal rules so I

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,980
want to illustrate this it might be kind

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,759
of hard to see so so I'll illustrate it

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,170
verbally as well so this is who's who's

00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,779
heard about dry code don't repeat

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,250
yourself yeah okay I'm gonna suing

00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:57,500
everyone most of the hands went up but I

00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,800
think most of you have heard about it so

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,600
um dry stands for don't repeat yourself

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,540
and this is one of the kind of first

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,209
tenets of clean great code that you

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,829
learn early on now we had a mentor come

00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:11,600
into our company and start to talk with

00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:14,329
us about how to make like really

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,680
adaptable agile code and this is

00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:17,720
something that she said over and over

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,600
again as we presented some of our

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,199
solutions to theoretical problems that

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,060
were like just perfectly well abstracted

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:30,170
she would say that code looks so dry

00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,480
that it chafes now if you're like a

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:36,529
runner or a cyclist like you know about

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,639
chafing it's not fun um and so I wanted

00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:40,819
to kind of like illustrate this with

00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,740
play-doh so here I have some brand new

00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:45,110
out of the container of play-doh and

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,850
it's like very pliable it's very like it

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,490
doesn't put up a lot of fight when I try

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,639
to change its shape I can make this be

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:54,470
whatever I need it to be now on this

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,750
side I have some dry play-doh

00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,850
now unfortunately play-doh has gotten

00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,579
really good and I thought two days out

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:05,449
would make it very dry but it only kind

00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:08,600
of made it kind of dry so um hopefully

00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,459
this will be enough um as I so this

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,120
resists me so as I try to like squish it

00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:16,310
it resists and if I really try to push

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,380
it you can see like cracks start to form

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,730
this is really it's it's very resistant

00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,889
to the change that I'm trying to apply

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,790
to it so it kind of wants to stay in

00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:27,889
this shape you can see you wanted to say

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,930
that does the purpose of design is to

00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:32,120
allow you to do design later and its

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:38,230
primary goal is to reduce the cost of

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:40,639
change and in that sense dry is dead

00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,319
something that's been dried out we

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,520
oftentimes have the experience of having

00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:46,470
to rehydrate it in order to make it

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,630
in order to change it to make the thing

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,570
that it now needs to be when we get new

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,280
constraints and inevitably we will get

00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,960
new constraints this is the way that

00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,800
that software works this is how our

00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:02,280
businesses and applications grow and

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:06,030
there's a context for all of these rules

00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,890
these strong tenets of code and they can

00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,300
be more or less divided into two

00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,070
categories things that we know and

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,410
things that we don't know things that we

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,240
know become naturally stable and things

00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:19,170
that we don't know need to remain

00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,940
pliable for as long as possible where we

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,730
get into trouble is when we try to like

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,760
take rules from one side and use them on

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:29,190
the other so an example is dry write dry

00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:32,580
is great in some cases we want a hat

00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,410
like you can't build a castle I guess

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,060
you can't build a castle out of play-doh

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,240
right you need stones you need hardened

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,740
stones that's good when we move that to

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,810
things that need to change things that

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,300
were uncertain about well that becomes

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,980
really that becomes bad it becomes hard

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,110
to change those things if they're dried

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,720
out another thing is readability

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,420
readability is awesome on things that

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,230
we're uncertain about and need to change

00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,000
regularly but it can become a liability

00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,070
in in parts of our code that are

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,140
hardened and I say that because while

00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,660
readability is always good sometimes it

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,650
does take a second third or fourth seed

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:13,950
to things like performance and when you

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:20,010
try to like re readable performant code

00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:22,140
you actually make it worse so in that I

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,290
believe that components are our

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,670
architecture now you can sub that for

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,440
modules if you're not a front-end

00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:32,670
developer however most of my experiences

00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:34,110
in the front-end space modules are

00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,480
really fascinating we have these a lot

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,270
in in music and music provides a

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,340
beautiful illustration for this in a lot

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:44,850
of musical systems like a modular system

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,790
in music production you have a lot of

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:50,390
black boxes and these black boxes are

00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,520
composed together to get a new sound

00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:55,320
each of these boxes the implementation

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,360
is hidden from you and you have just an

00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,620
interface to kind of control the you

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,900
know

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:05,570
the parameters of that and these modules

00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,890
can come from very disparate places they

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,900
can come from different manufacturers

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,039
that can have very different things but

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,830
as long as they have a single

00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,150
responsibility and they have a common

00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:17,980
interface well they can all work

00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:20,210
together to create a new sound and if

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,500
something burns up or you decide that

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,460
you don't like this part of your sound

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,470
you don't have to replace the whole

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,549
thing you can just pop out the part that

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,610
doesn't work and replace it with

00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:30,380
something else you love Mikey no

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:34,279
Photoshop there it's so photorealistic

00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:36,559
what I've done and so what I want in my

00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,960
code is not so much that it's clean but

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,850
that it has well-defined interfaces that

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,490
everything can be hot swappable I have

00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:48,289
these hot swappable black boxes that I

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:50,240
can compose in neat ways and once we

00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:51,950
have that clean code really just becomes

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,260
fashion a lot of these rules that we

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:57,010
have for like where semicolons should be

00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,120
and spaces should be and like how many

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,370
variables should be defined on which

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,279
lines and all that stuff becomes really

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:07,340
less important when you think about code

00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,710
like this in terms of interfaces so I

00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:13,940
want to present to you four tenets or

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:16,840
things to think about to make code like

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:20,330
this and I call this hot garbage

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,679
architecture so the first thing is the

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:25,190
code should be pliable one of the things

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,919
that I see more often than not is this

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,570
this idea of speculative generality so

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,090
you you know that you need to make a

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,850
modal and so you go in you're like modal

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:37,039
Jas right like you just claimed the

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,110
namespace this is gonna be the modal for

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,230
now and forever everything is gonna use

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:44,659
this thing and we're always wrong every

00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,000
time maybe you kind of got it a little

00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:49,789
bit right but like it's it's never

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,100
perfectly right it's like hole-in-one

00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:55,850
odds right yeah we're gonna be playing

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:57,679
golf tomorrow or some of us are and it'd

00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,480
be like trying to optimize your golf

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,890
game around getting hole-in-ones well

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,149
you can just be on the field the

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,799
rest of the time but as long as you get

00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:05,870
a number of hole-in-ones right like

00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:10,700
you're really crushing it it's not how

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:11,420
golf works and I see this a lot I try

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,040
not to pick on like

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,730
specific libraries but this is one that

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,820
look really kind of hurts hurts code

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:22,430
regularly that I've seen and this is

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,110
some so yes lint plugin react if you're

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,790
a reactant developer there's a whole

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,730
bunch of kind of pedantic rules that

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:31,250
don't seem to kind of be based out of

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:33,230
kind of a philosophy about code really

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,780
but just the fact that there is a

00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,870
natural state and so maybe we should

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,380
define a kind of like a stricter state I

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,270
guess

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,780
so one of these is like one component

00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:47,750
per file and that just ops you out of

00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,290
modules altogether which seems crazy and

00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:54,950
so the second thing the second tenant is

00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:59,120
composability this is what my favorite

00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:01,700
Lego sets ever I think it used to be

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,890
like $5.00 and now it's like 35 if you

00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,490
were to try to find it on the black

00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:09,140
market

00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:11,000
whoops Lego so my favorite thing about

00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,950
this is that it's an honest-to-goodness

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,540
three in one set you don't have like a

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,580
lot of pieces left over it's like when

00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,670
you tear it down and you make the new

00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:23,420
thing it like all the pieces are used

00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:26,000
absolutely incredible and I wanted to

00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,680
bring it today but I asked my son if he

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,270
could give it to me and he said you

00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,810
won't dad I'm actually experimenting

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:38,090
with a mono repo structure for my Lego

00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:42,560
so I'm not sure I could find it but it's

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:47,390
blazing fast dad you know at least he

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:49,730
knows how to sell it so I see this in

00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,740
react components a lot where we have a

00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,360
lot of we have one component and it's

00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,940
like oh cool like this is this is our

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,070
accordion this is accordion j/s we're

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,280
gonna use it everywhere but over time

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:03,320
you start to add a ton of like a ton of

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:08,360
properties for these things for very

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:10,880
disparate situations and each one of

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:15,410
these properties is it can is a

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,420
configuration now I'm not going to go

00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,310
into it but the code that I prefer to

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,770
see is when we use components over

00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,080
configuration we're instead of having a

00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,130
lot of configuration a lot of props that

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,470
we pass down for all

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:31,370
these disparate situations we actually

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:33,940
expose like this on this Lego box tools

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,800
for creating multiple different things

00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,930
so instead of instead of configuring

00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,820
this one thing we say here are all the

00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:44,440
parts you do whatever you want with it

00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:47,780
it's gonna work and use your imagination

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,400
if you're not a react developer you're

00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,250
going to give this as functions over

00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,580
configuration though it doesn't have to

00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:57,970
cease so it's less cool

00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:00,080
the third tenet is I'm a reasonableness

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,550
my little marker on the bottom didn't

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,870
move that's sad but we're we're an

00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:08,120
umbrella Tora Terry territory right now

00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:11,950
so this umbrella is very reasonable it's

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,530
raining outside this umbrella is

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:17,600
unreasonable it's not raining outside

00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:22,010
this one's realistic and this one is

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,670
speculative this is where it starts to

00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:26,090
hurt

00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:31,970
timely perf optimization is reasonable

00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:34,280
and perf always is not reasonable so

00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,720
when I teach I get this a lot I show

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,940
people how to make a click counter and

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,740
react and then I write it like this I

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,540
use an anonymous function I write set

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,060
state in line and then I just do it like

00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,250
do it all right there and people who

00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,770
have not actually learned enough react

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:53,330
to make anything say isn't this not

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:56,840
performant and I say well sure if you

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,070
were to make a UI like this but that

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,970
seems terrible and it's not going to

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:04,040
make you any money so one thing for this

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,300
is I say love your manager I know that a

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,430
lot of times we have a very tenuous

00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:10,160
relationship with our managers and it

00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,990
sucks like I get it they want they want

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,540
something for the customer and we just

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:17,120
want to like make sure that the code is

00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:21,320
perfect and so they're always harsh

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,540
inner mellow I get it but managers like

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,540
see the North Star like money is always

00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,280
in the North Star we need to make money

00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,290
to keep doing our job the company needs

00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,060
to like if we stop making money well

00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:34,340
like the whole thing kind of starts to

00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,440
collapse and also I'm gonna be honest

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,540
they know something about us too they

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,670
know that code rage is immutable

00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,920
you were always gonna hate the code

00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,780
that's on your screen weather like it's

00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,030
written by the last idiot that touched

00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:50,750
it or you wrote it half an hour ago

00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:52,340
you're gonna hate it and the only real

00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,110
like kind of objective tool that you can

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,900
use for like measuring like whether or

00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,480
not something should be changed is

00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,310
churned versus complexity

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,840
so this graph kind of illustrates that a

00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,940
little bit you can google it find all

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,130
kinds of articles on it but basically if

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,320
you have low complexity or what is it

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,780
high complexity and low churn don't

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,030
touch it if you have low complexity and

00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,320
high churn like don't touch it you want

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,330
to look for the outliers where you have

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:21,500
high complexity and high churn because

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:25,250
that is regularly costing you money so

00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,270
finally the fourth or I'm not sure why

00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,420
this is up there

00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:34,130
I made these slides but now I'm confused

00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:35,810
is disposability so a friend of mine

00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,070
early on the first person who actually

00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,680
believed that I could be a programmer

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,500
kind of told me this and it stuck with

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:45,980
me ever since he says we add code ask

00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:48,050
yourself how easily it will how easily

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,960
it would be removed when you realize you

00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:54,050
were wrong and you want to be able to

00:25:50,960 --> 00:26:00,410
take that stuff out Oh without a trace

00:25:54,050 --> 00:26:02,360
stupid stupid so these are the these are

00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,930
the four kind of things to look out for

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,540
when you are kind of writing

00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:10,040
architecting your code so what can I

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,450
tell you I can tell you from personal

00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,400
experience I've been writing code like

00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,650
this for about a year and I've become a

00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,470
much happier person I've become way less

00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:21,080
of a monster in the kitchen I've become

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,420
way less pedantic and pull requests way

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,450
more accepting of code that like doesn't

00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,550
really fit my personal aesthetic and

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:32,270
it's made all of us more productive it's

00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:34,370
given me a kind of a comfortable space

00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:36,860
to be able to hear other people's input

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,870
and I've learned so much from other

00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,700
people that I would have not I would

00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,370
have never learned if I just shut them

00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:46,370
out immediately on some type of

00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:48,620
religious ideal but don't listen don't

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:52,040
listen to me like don't like listen to

00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,530
Kent Beck Kent Beck is an amazing

00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,850
program

00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:56,610
he's been doing this thing for a long

00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:59,130
time he is the creator of extreme

00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,650
programming where he does things tests

00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,350
first where he defines the interface and

00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:07,140
then writes the code and he went on to

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,330
be some c-level engineer at a company

00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,690
whose motto is move fast and break

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,730
things

00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,950
so mute the thought leaders remember

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:20,520
that the product is just a function of

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,560
the special specification hey and we are

00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,630
that function and sometimes that means

00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,050
that we're just shoveling code from

00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:32,580
one place to another until it all works

00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:34,260
but green code is green code thank you

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,880
so much for coming out to this grifters

00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,840
Anonymous meeting I really appreciate

00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,480
your time I've been thinking about how

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,490
to work in this industry for the next 10

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:50,400
20 30 years happily I realized that

00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:53,640
maybe our ideas of being a builder are

00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,750
starting to fail us just a little bit we

00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,700
have these ideas that we were like

00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,800
engineers developers architects so we

00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,360
use frameworks and scaffolding the idea

00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,250
of being a builder and these

00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,790
construction analogies have really

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:07,500
deeply integrated with code work and I

00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,690
think that they're starting to fail a

00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,330
little bit because we don't necessarily

00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:15,000
build things that last 50 years a

00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,500
hundred years two hundred years it's

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,480
possible that when I get back from this

00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,130
trip a specification on something that

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,830
I'm working on will have changed and I

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,900
will have to rewrite the whole thing and

00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:28,470
that's not like the part of the job

00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:32,970
that is the job I think that we're more

00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:38,580
like farmers we are farmers bump bump

00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:40,950
bump bump yeah and the reason is we work

00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,450
on living things we don't take dead

00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,250
things and make more dead things out of

00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,170
them like a building we take living

00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:49,410
things and we try to make living things

00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:52,910
out of them and cultivation is a mess so

00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:54,870
who knows where the best fertilizer is

00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:57,490
 that's right

00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:01,059
 is the best fertilizer

00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:04,630
I don't know why I had to put it twice I

00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:06,010
guess it's more accessible this way so

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:12,460
to end my talk I wanted to be kind of

00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:15,580
like this guy the extremely divisive so

00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,080
I'm ending with a Bible verse and this

00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,400
is my favorite bible verse when I have

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,710
to put something in a production now

00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,240
really don't feel great about I attached

00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:25,300
to this little verse the reference to

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,510
this verse in with a pull request where

00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,520
there are no oxen the stable is clean

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:33,820
but abundant crops come by the strength

00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:36,070
of the Ox now the Bible has a tendency

00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,110
to put things a little bit politey um so

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,280
let me break this down for you clean

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,860
code is dead code

00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:47,820
there's where money is made get it

00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,820
