all right so hello everyone I'm Kevin

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:39,730
O'Neill and I'm a visually impaired

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,670
front-end developer so in this talk I

00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,860
wanted to go over some of the challenges

00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,430
and some of the solutions that I came up

00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:53,820
with during my five years of working in

00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:57,399
the house working as a web developer and

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,260
so as I mentioned my name is Kevin no no

00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,840
this is my twitter handle sorry it's a

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,680
little bit strange that's two

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,130
underscores twice so if you have any

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:16,479
questions or any suggestions please send

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:19,930
me a message that'll be great so I

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:24,010
worked at fast retailing it's a large

00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:26,680
apparel company and based in Japan and

00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:30,490
if you've been to Japan before you've

00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,490
probably noticed a brand unique glow and

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,619
we have some stores in the US as well so

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,200
if you happen to come across any of

00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:41,710
those stores please do check out some of

00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,170
the items that we have for sale I'm

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:51,490
actually wearing one of them right now

00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:57,700
so all right so one thing I wanted to

00:01:51,490 --> 00:02:00,790
say was six years ago I was at

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:06,100
university and I had a lot of self

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:09,429
self-doubt and so for example I kind of

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:12,730
felt like perhaps I wasn't good enough

00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:16,000
to kind of like be a developer or to

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,769
kind of like find a job just because of

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,459
some of the experiences that I went

00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:23,770
through and what I wanted to say like

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,570
what this presentation is

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:30,820
please don't fall into that trap it's

00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:33,760
easy to get to get discouraged and to

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:38,170
kind of not try to push yourself and

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,600
perhaps a lot of things can cause that I

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,120
wanted to ask everybody if you happen to

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,020
know somebody else who is able to

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,460
challenge or has a lot of other

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:55,510
difficulties or challenges please share

00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:56,770
this story with them so right here I'm

00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,390
just going to go through some of the

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,630
conditions that I have these are

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,760
actually there's three of them in total

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,850
and this is what I was born with

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,970
there is no corrective surgery for them

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:12,760
at this time so it's something that I'm

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,480
gonna have to just be stuck with until

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,480
there is something like that so the

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,850
first one is nystagmus which is a vision

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,770
condition in which makes the eyes eye

00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:28,630
Federative uncontrolled movements so

00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:30,610
sometimes like if you if you look at me

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,100
like I'm I don't probably go like in

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,370
random places or they'll be stuck in one

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:39,730
other complete different direction so

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,310
there's that the second one is myopia

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,290
which is nearsightedness and this is I

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,080
have quite of an extreme version of

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,209
nearsightedness that makes it quite

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,970
difficult thankfully I have these

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:56,260
glasses here that can extend my vision

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:58,900
quite a bit but mostly it's for if I'm

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,590
out and about or outside unfortunately

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:06,040
when it comes to like using a computer

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:09,580
screen or working I'm so used to not

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:14,440
having them on you don't tend to work

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:17,230
really well for those situations and the

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,900
last one I actually have difficult even

00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:23,830
still pronouncing it maybe it's a blue

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:28,260
man phobia and it's it's also known as

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:31,320
like the lazy eye so those are the three

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,840
things that I have and we can actually

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,370
simulate this a little bit so I'm gonna

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,570
take off my glasses right now

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,970
and if you actually extend take out one

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:48,340
of your arms and extend it beyond that

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:50,380
point I can barely I can actually barely

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,250
see it's extremely burly if I'm looking

00:04:50,380 --> 00:05:00,520
out right now I can it's all just a big

00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:03,490
blob or a big blur and the second part

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,110
that my condition is that if you take

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,270
one hand and you place it over your eye

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:11,860
that's actually the field of vision that

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:20,710
I have like entirely so it's very narrow

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:23,200
and cut in half basically so about let's

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:26,440
say almost a year ago I ran into this

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:31,780
article by the Pew Research Center and I

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:34,150
found it pretty shocking and sad and as

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,570
you can see in the headline there's

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:40,510
quite a large digital divide between

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:45,669
people with disabilities or challenges

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:49,260
and and if you haven't heard of the term

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:53,650
like digital divide I'm sure you have

00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:56,680
it's the gap between the people who have

00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:59,200
access to technology or the internet and

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,590
those who don't so what I hope with this

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:07,330
presentation is in a way to close that

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:10,720
gap and I'll come back to this later on

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:16,120
a later point how I hope to achieve this

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:19,810
in the near future so this is one of the

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,430
this is the quote from the article that

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,979
kind of stood out for me

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,139
disabled Americans are about three times

00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:29,200
as likely as those with a disability to

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,020
say they never go online 22% versus 8%

00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,990
according to a Pew Research Center

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:40,500
survey conducted in the fall of 2016 so

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,500
that's quite a big gap

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,710
and so I'm gonna start with my story

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:53,300
here so I graduated from Cal State San

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:55,520
Marcos it's about a maybe a 25 20 25

00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:00,050
minute drive from here actually and I

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,520
scheduled in December of 2012 and I

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,490
graduated with Visual and Performing

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,930
Arts

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:09,789
Technology degree so this is basically

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:16,840
like a graphic digital graphic design

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:20,660
and it took me about a year to find a

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,520
full-time job and part of this is

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,740
because like as you know when you're

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,199
trying to find your first job it can be

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,930
really really difficult just because

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,229
you're trying to stand out from other

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,910
applicants and getting your first job is

00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:39,470
always the most difficult thing but in

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:40,880
my case since I was I'm raised in

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,130
Southern California I have these eye

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,840
conditions I am not legally allowed to

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:50,080
drive so often when I had an interview

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,520
and the employer might be asking

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,419
reasonably so of course like how would

00:07:52,520 --> 00:08:00,409
you get to work and most of the times I

00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:08,570
couldn't figure out like how to answer

00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:13,630
that question and so I started looking

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:16,190
for places that would have a better

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,940
public transportation system something

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,349
like yeah

00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:25,460
maybe in New York City or perhaps like

00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:27,199
Portland Seattle just anything that

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,280
could kind of help me get to work on

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,959
Simon in during this timeframe I

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:37,339
actually got in contact with someone via

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:42,709
LinkedIn and I ended up in Tokyo Japan

00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:44,060
we're just crying big ya jump I'm not

00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:45,829
going to get too much into like the

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,740
cultural differences in this

00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:51,260
presentation unfortunately but here I'm

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,620
just going to talk about like a little

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,620
bit of

00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:00,040
like what I found when I've been living

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,360
there this is a disclaimer some of the

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,890
points or advice that I'm gonna give out

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:09,529
in this presentation might be just a

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:13,970
little bit tailored to just what how

00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:19,610
that Japanese job market is or how my

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:21,110
experiences have been so this part is

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,740
about some of the advice that I would

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:28,270
give to myself like five years ago six

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,270
years ago when I was looking for a job

00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:35,960
and one of those things is that if you

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:43,250
have if you're a really challenged or

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:47,600
you want to yeah I need some help I was

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:50,120
able to make a take advantage of the

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,880
California Department state of rehab if

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,730
you are from another state I'm sure that

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,950
there's another similar branch or

00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,170
division and there's a lot of

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:05,960
educational and vocational programs that

00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:07,490
they give out and help anyone disability

00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,170
so I wanted to give a shout out and

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,339
wanted to thank the California

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,089
Department rehab for making this

00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,620
possible

00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:17,650
because without them I wouldn't be

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,650
speaking here in front of all of you

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:25,880
another thing so when I was first my

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,260
first job in my second job hi I should

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:35,360
did not ask for any help for my employer

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:38,959
to make my working situation a lot

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:43,580
easier to become more efficient so I'm

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:46,790
gonna show like an example of this this

00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,470
is basically my setup in my previous

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,600
company a friend of mine took this photo

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:54,620
just to illustrate like how close I have

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,330
to be to the screen and it was great cuz

00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,240
this is just like a monitor arm that

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:01,400
just attaches to your desk so this way I

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:05,300
can move around the monitor freely if I

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:07,160
need to and this is part of like why

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,260
I think it's important if you work like

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,430
for a good employer or someone that

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,899
really cares about you

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,850
they're willing to try to help you be a

00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,680
lot more comfortable or be more

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,480
efficient at your job

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,870
and this is what allowed me to do that

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,880
so I wanted to thank my previous

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,930
employer my current employer for making

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,269
that happen

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:33,920
hopefully that starts happening a lot

00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:37,760
more and that was just like one of the

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,480
most amazing things for me being able to

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:46,519
take advantage of that and now I want to

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:50,990
get into some of the tools that I was

00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:58,370
able to use during my time as a

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:59,209
front-end developer and so my one of my

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,740
jobs

00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:06,200
it was quite imperative to quite

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,709
important to keep the I say how

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,810
pixel-perfect designs so the designer

00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:14,690
would of course I'm designed something

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,250
in Photoshop or illustrator and they

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,829
would send it to us the front-end

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,890
developer team and it needed to be like

00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:26,209
pixel perfect like every pixel needed to

00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:28,010
work or needed to be aligned in every in

00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:32,170
a lot of browsers including Internet

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:35,779
Explorer so that was kind of tough

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:44,000
especially as someone who is nearsighted

00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:47,630
and so with this part I wanted to tell

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,839
another story so it was quite late at

00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:58,690
night maybe 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. and in

00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:01,279
order to one of the designers would take

00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,709
my web page that I was working on and

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:08,540
his design and he printed it out I'd

00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:11,420
have no like physical media of this on

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,730
paper and wood came over to me and

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,399
started asking like hey this is how it

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,899
should actually look and he took started

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,880
taking out a ruler and kind of like

00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:23,730
compared

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:26,460
how close like everything should be my

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,910
coworker right next to me actually said

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,970
hey so I have a better idea why don't

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:37,800
you just use this and this next slide is

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:41,280
a little bit like I heard your eyes a

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,200
bit so I'm going to just show it at

00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,640
first for a couple of seconds and then

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,890
move back so that was great because it's

00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,760
a little chrome extension that you can

00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:57,060
just install and it will basically you

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,220
could set an image and it'll just lay it

00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,360
on top of your website so you can kind

00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:06,690
of like compare and see how close your

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,820
final web page is to design and not only

00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:11,490
that but I was able to use it with some

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,460
of the accessibility tools that are

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:16,890
found in the Mac system preferences so

00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:20,490
that was extremely helpful compared to

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:23,370
just dealing in the physical realm I

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:26,910
could just use the the great tools that

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:30,660
are already inside of the operating

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:34,410
system or Mac OS or Windows or whichever

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,920
one whichever OS you'd like to use and

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:40,500
that was like incredible so here's some

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:47,340
of the things that I like to set for

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:49,680
example and if you're using a Mac OS

00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:53,790
then you can just go to the top left

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,530
there's the Apple icon you click on that

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,600
and go System Preferences and you click

00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,700
on accessibility and the screen will pop

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,500
up and now there are different options

00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,790
that you a lot of different options that

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:08,760
you can set and down here at the bottom

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:11,580
there's zoom command so there's two

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:15,380
different kinds of zooms that you can

00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:17,670
use you can either have it set so it's

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,320
picture-in-picture as it's shown in here

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:23,010
and what that will do is it will create

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:26,700
a little frame inside of whenever you're

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:28,020
zooming in and there's the full screen

00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,610
zoom which is doing that I actually

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:34,029
really like to use

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:36,519
and that was part of the tools that I

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:40,029
was able to use to help me out a lot

00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:43,809
when I had to compare the designs with

00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:47,350
the pixel-perfect extension and here's

00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:49,089
some advanced options just in case so

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:55,959
it's yeah just as the arrow points on

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:58,179
the bottom right hand side and there's a

00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:00,939
lot of other settings that I go through

00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:04,170
and every time I set up a new computer I

00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:06,879
make sure that all of these are set or

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:10,350
hopefully I can kind of sync them up in

00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:13,089
a way so for example like in the chrome

00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,019
settings which is what I usually use for

00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:17,649
development

00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:19,779
I sent the font size too large just

00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:23,949
because it's a lot more helpful so I can

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:27,540
see and they even have page zooms that

00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:30,999
you can adjust and see whatever you want

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:33,369
we can we're helpful and okay so we're

00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:37,389
developers and we spend a lot of time in

00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:41,189
editors and I've jumped around through a

00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:45,939
bunch of different editors and so far

00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:49,179
although I use Visual Studio code all

00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,959
the time I love that I love that editor

00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:54,540
a lot

00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:57,519
I found the extensibility in Adam to be

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,649
really really really helpful I'm not

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,819
showing a previous slide but there's

00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:05,529
lots of great editors that you could

00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:10,419
make very extremely customizable and

00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:12,339
here these are my basic settings and you

00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:14,649
can ignore the bottom or the bottom up

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:19,240
bottom parts of it but yeah I usually

00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:22,600
send everything to 22 or 24 size fonts

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,419
even for the integrated terminal and a

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,490
lot of different other applications just

00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,909
because that's what I'm used to but

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:33,429
again everybody has their own challenges

00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:38,500
and difficulties so it might be higher

00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:42,870
might be lower and this is what it looks

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:51,670
like when I am editing

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:53,679
any my code okay so as I mentioned

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:58,450
earlier Adam is really great at

00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:01,390
extending extending the user interface

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:07,360
and but I really hope to do in the

00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:10,750
future is perhaps make a theme that for

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,840
example this city lights UI seeing that

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:16,990
can help perhaps people who have my

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,850
condition or other Pete other people who

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:23,590
are a really challenged and find ways to

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:28,510
make their time working a lot easier the

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:32,320
reason why I really like this theme is

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:35,020
because it puts the search right in the

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,500
front and pretty much the center of the

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:40,330
screen and you can kind of adjust it to

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:44,890
make it either the text bigger or

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:47,230
smaller this is what I hope I haven't

00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:50,050
found a way to do it in Visual Studio

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:53,650
code yet but if you do happen to know

00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:56,500
something like to make the search a lot

00:18:53,650 --> 00:19:02,370
easier please please please do let me

00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:05,070
know and then I can share that ok so

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:08,610
here's another thing that I found when

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:12,960
I've been working for about 5 years now

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:17,640
sometimes as we all do we need help with

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,929
what we're doing I need help with a

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,800
particular problem so I'll go to a

00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:25,960
co-worker the thing is that when because

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,890
of my nearsightedness there's either two

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:33,550
options that we generally have or at

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:35,440
least that I first thought of is either

00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:38,830
I get I have to get really close to

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:42,040
their screen or they would have to kind

00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:44,679
of adjust their settings or something

00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:47,710
like using the command or n+ tool to

00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:52,990
kind of just like see zoom in the screen

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:55,710
but there is like a better way that I

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:58,260
found to do this and instead of

00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:01,020
my coworker having to reset their

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,300
settings or go through their keyboard

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,690
shortcuts again and reset their

00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:10,640
environments I actually found yes live

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:16,650
share to be extremely helpful for this

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:18,420
and Adam has teletype as well I haven't

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,790
been able to use it yet but I'm gonna

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,160
give it a try

00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:26,160
soon and so these tools are actually

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:30,800
really helpful for me a lot perhaps at

00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:33,690
first they were intended to of course be

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,070
more of like um maybe we're both if

00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,020
you're working remotely with other

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,210
co-workers to kind of like do pair

00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,590
programming but this these tools are

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,620
extremely helpful and I'm very thankful

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:51,630
that they're around and it's very easy

00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:55,500
to get started on the menus them so what

00:20:51,630 --> 00:21:03,930
can we do what can we all do to kind of

00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:07,140
make accessibility better or make

00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:11,910
improvements or start on these so this

00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:15,150
is a great course by Google at I ready

00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:18,990
to see you then it's Udacity and I

00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:20,640
actually have started there's a couple

00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,070
of months back just to learn more about

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,720
how what I can do what part that I can

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:30,540
do to kind of improve accessibility for

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,330
everyone so if you can please recommend

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:37,440
this to anybody that you know it's a

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,880
great course I believe it's a couple of

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,000
they have a couple of chapters maybe a

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:47,670
couple of hours and also I one of the

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,510
sister conferences Marci did a amazing

00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:53,810
talk on improving improving

00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:58,230
accessibility with empathy driven

00:21:53,810 --> 00:22:03,780
development so if you can't please take

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:08,880
off a check out her je s coffee you talk

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:15,510
and workshops so at my previous company

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:17,610
I wanted we were quite a big team or

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:22,020
like quite a small team actually but

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:23,760
they're around 24 back-end developers

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:28,130
and two front-end developers including

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:31,980
me so I wanted to kind of show what

00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:33,720
front-end development was like and so I

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,520
started these workshops these internal

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,200
workshops to kind of teach back-end

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,120
developers about front-end development

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:45,570
and I was I I found that they were they

00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:49,710
found to be pretty successful and what I

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:53,310
wanted to do in the future is to start

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:56,580
an accessibility workshop perhaps here

00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:59,640
back in the United States or even in

00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:07,080
Japan to kind of encourage people to get

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:09,530
started and so that's about it for my

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,200
presentation thank you so much for

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:17,200
