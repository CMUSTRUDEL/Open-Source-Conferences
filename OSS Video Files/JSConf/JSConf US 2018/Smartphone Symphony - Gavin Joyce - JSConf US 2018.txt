[Music]

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:34,239
I'm very excited to be here two parts of

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,520
my talk rely on real-time communication

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,690
between my phone my laptop and your

00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,969
laptops and the Wi-Fi seems to be

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,940
operating by courier pigeon here so

00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:48,040
perhaps if you could turn off the Wi-Fi

00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,660
on your laptops just for the duration of

00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:55,720
this talk look at this room for the

00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:59,070
phones to actually work and it's just

00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:02,829
stopped working okay all right so I work

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:06,009
for intercom in Dublin Ireland we also

00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:08,619
have offices in San Francisco and London

00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:10,180
you might recognize us from our

00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:12,729
messenger which is in the bottom

00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,770
right-hand corner of a lots of great web

00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:17,590
businesses it's a react app to pay two

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:20,620
and a half years old we also have quite

00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,270
a large amber app which is the app that

00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,640
our customers use day in day out and

00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,799
it's four and a half years old unlike

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,950
most amber apps that follow the six week

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,650
upgrade release cycle it's never been

00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,750
healthier in terms of codebase

00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,180
having had quite a few chats with some

00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,090
of you in the last couple of days I know

00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,500
a lot of you work for great companies

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,320
I'm proud to say the intercom is also a

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,180
great company we've a strong ambition to

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,460
become one of the great technology

00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,470
companies unlike all great companies we

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,310
like to share our ideas these are some

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:56,140
books that we publish as an example

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,900
sharing stories helps us attract amazing

00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,689
people to intercom everyone who joins

00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,490
our under into under anniversary their

00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,340
entry to get an inter comic which kind

00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:09,429
of celebrates some of the impact and fun

00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,150
that they've had over a year these are

00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:15,909
my four inter comics they're all amber

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,319
themed the reason I'm telling you this

00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:20,800
in a little more detail than I normally

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,739
would is to give you some background for

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,819
this conference talk each year we hold a

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,120
series of

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:29,530
dr. focus events across the world where

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,079
we share our approach to building

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,680
products that hopefully people love this

00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:38,590
picture is from San Francisco and this

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,049
is London and Dublin and in November

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,450
last year again in Dublin in famous

00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:46,480
vicar street we had a first set of

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:50,109
technical talks about our approach to

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,200
building and iterating products in

00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:54,370
income this was a really amazing night

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,849
it was more like a Radiohead concert

00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,409
than a typical tech event I'm forward I

00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:02,250
wanted to come up with something a

00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:05,109
little different and hopefully fun I

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,669
think it's amazing that we get to live

00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:08,949
in a time where it's possible to build

00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:10,719
an impactful career where the work

00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:13,739
rarely feels like work and I just want

00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,230
to have a little fun with my talk so

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,639
this was the first slide of my talk

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,340
gonna be good intro to the rest of this

00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,010
talk my slides are an Amber app running

00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,169
on my laptop I'm also running the same

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:30,370
app on my phone which allows me to

00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:32,439
control the presentation I'll soon ask

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,689
you to open the same web app on your

00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:44,169
phones too so you can interact with the

00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:47,290
presentation so when I trigger drum

00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:49,479
sound on my phone will send real-time

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,009
messages to all connected phones and

00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,639
these messages are being relayed through

00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:57,189
a simple socket I own node server which

00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:01,720
is running in Amazon's California data

00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:04,000
center so the initial part of my talk

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:12,519
that I gave in Dublin went pretty well

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:16,079
this was a high point then a few seconds

00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,079
later it actually no longer works

00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:37,319
so the server crashed I'd no way to get

00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,729
the presentation running again so I

00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,740
couldn't complete the second part of my

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:43,680
12th Jan not a huge deal one of the

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,069
themes of that night was risk-taking

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,900
this was a little bit of a risk

00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:50,699
after go home I realized my mistake I

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,889
was missing a guard there was a race

00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,810
condition and an exception brought down

00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,879
the server at the time I hadn't done

00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,919
much node I've done a little more now

00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:03,599
hopefully that is a lesson learned

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:05,069
we'll see so I got to give my talk a

00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:07,590
second time earlier in the year and

00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:10,199
eMERCOM from Portland happily all the

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:34,979
major parts of the talk worked through a

00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:38,520
few little issues luckily they were

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:41,580
mostly minor UI issues and the broadly

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,500
worked as I'd hoped as luck would have

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,099
it the third instrument the orange one

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,779
at the bottom

00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:48,599
I was actually controlled by someone in

00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:51,449
Zimbabwe there was a live stream and

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:54,469
Lennox happened to be you know picked

00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:57,750
randomly which is pretty special

00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:59,580
so before we try to here I want to talk

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,909
a little bit about the software that

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,069
allows these presentations to be created

00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:08,849
since amber calm I've begun extracting

00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:11,939
the guts there of that talk into an

00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:13,860
Amber add-on called Amber present and it

00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,199
allows anyone to create rich interactive

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,259
real-time presentations with Amber

00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,159
components so amber knew to create an

00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:25,319
ember app and reinstall amber present

00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:28,589
allows it to become a slideshow an Amber

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:32,520
generate slide will generate at the root

00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:34,979
and the components so presentation

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,370
slides are defined much like amber

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:42,480
routes just with slide instead of Rouge

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:45,640
and slide contents are defined in

00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:53,620
so with a little content in style here's

00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:56,070
those exact slides and as presentations

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,050
can be interactive they can also can

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,060
define multiple roles so in this case

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,030
there is a presenter role in a screen

00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:13,420
role and running locally this is what

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:14,800
that looks like and here's what this

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,740
talked and giving right now looks like

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,800
when running locally so at the top is

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,830
the screen on the very left is my phone

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,270
and then for phones in the audience as

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,640
you can see it's it's real-time it's

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:31,480
very easy to create like real-time polls

00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:33,790
and things of that there's other useful

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,700
components so components for doing code

00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:40,030
with highlighting and video components

00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:43,270
and as real-time controls for playback

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,820
or setting sections and I can yeah by

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,470
pressing button change the video not

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,940
particularly useful you can do things

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,770
like change your background color in

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:55,080
real time as well I'm just clicking a

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:59,950
button there and represent comes with

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,590
tailwind CS CSS so it's very easy to

00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,510
spin up and style slides and this should

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:11,980
help adding themes which I hope to do

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:14,320
soon slides scale keepo 69 ratio and

00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:23,890
it's also because it's real-time I can

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:25,090
do like a real-time pointer this is an

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,620
animated slide that I created for

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,400
another talk that I gave two years ago

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,110
an animated guide to ember and the thing

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,849
I'm most excited about and I only

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,590
recently realized that whatever present

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:39,880
is the possibility of publishing

00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,710
presentations as NPM packages and

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,800
allowing others to import them into

00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:47,560
their own presentations and reusing them

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,130
so I've created a lot of animations like

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,020
this that have only been seen once and

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,900
hopefully it can be useful to other

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,990
people when going to like local meetups

00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,600
or conferences or whatever if you saw

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,210
Chad's talk on compilers this morning

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,520
and performance this is a visualization

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:09,150
I made of a earlier version of the

00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,320
glimmer VM and I'm kind of showing it

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,850
now because I wanted to be seen in a

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,480
second time because it took me like two

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:18,300
weeks to make it's a little out of date

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,180
now but it's showing the inner workings

00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:25,830
of the glimmer VM as if initially

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:28,020
rendered as a page so I'm hoping to redo

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,430
these animations to bring them up to the

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,960
latest glimmer version so that other

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,810
people can use them

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,090
here's another example this is Alex Alex

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,790
Marcin ear giving a great talk on his

00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,710
ember concurrency add-on and his

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:45,600
presentation was a custom-built Hammer

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:47,640
app to demonstrate his this was a real

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,260
inspiration to me at the time I wanted

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,560
to be able to put amber into my

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,810
presentations like his so with his

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,440
permission yesterday i extracted some of

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:03,120
his components from his talk into and

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,620
amber presented on so here are those

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,340
slides here so you can just amber

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:11,160
install that add-on and you you get

00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:15,390
slides like this so briefly amber

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,810
concurrency is a add-on for an API

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,760
declarative API for constraining

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:24,270
concurrent tasks and the core primitive

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,950
is tasks which accept generator

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,290
functions so in this case it's just a

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:32,220
simple function that waits for two

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,870
seconds and I can click perform here and

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,430
actually you can see a visualization of

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,900
this running so by default they all run

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,600
concurrently amber concurrency isn't

00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,760
doing anything but we get these task

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,450
modifiers so here is the drop modifier

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,740
and you can see if I run this it well if

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,140
there's already an instance of a task

00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,460
running it will drop you tasks until

00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,470
it's it's clear

00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:02,330
here's another modifier and cue and you

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,330
can guess what that does accuse them up

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:09,690
and probably the most reason we are most

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,710
commonly used one is restartable it

00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:17,430
could be used for like depends search

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,750
and things that as a final example in

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,529
amber camp this year

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:42,240
Edward Falconer introduced his new

00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:45,149
add-on amber animation so like where

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,950
amber concurrency I created a few slides

00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:48,360
to demonstrate this as well so I the

00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,459
left and right button here and if I

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,860
click left you'll see one of the logos

00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,930
randomly will move from less than the

00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,370
right to the left if I hit it a few

00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,250
times left and right they kind of do a

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,200
dance which is cool the amazing thing

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,910
about amber animated is that all I'm

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,070
doing here is defining where the list

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:08,430
should be rendered and then removing an

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:10,470
item and inserting it into your array in

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:14,220
a random location and the natural

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:17,010
movement emerges from the sprites which

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,620
are coordinating behind the scenes and

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,390
this animation these animations can also

00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,750
happen across routes here as we saw

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:29,310
there so amber and I made it as a core

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:33,690
primitive within amber present so soon

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:35,570
it will be easy to have nice animations

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:40,980
between slides

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:43,650
alright so live demo time it's 2018 it's

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,959
like this will maybe work I don't know

00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:48,779
if you'd like to participate please take

00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:55,829
out your phone and load this web address

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:57,870
bitly slash JSC 1:8 when it loads you

00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:59,610
can enter your name just click Next if

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:05,610
your name is taken just put in a random

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:08,880
name will be triggering sounds in your

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,579
phone so please turn up the volume and

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:16,380
you can press the buttons to test the

00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:18,360
sound locally if you get an iPhone you

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:28,829
mean it may need to flip the lid the

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:30,390
mute switch you can see in the top right

00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:33,180
there's a count of the number of people

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:48,420
connected I know there's maybe 200

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:49,890
people in the rim so this demo will work

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,060
best if your phone doesn't go to sleep

00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,890
so every now and again you'll get a

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,760
little reminder just to touch the screen

00:13:52,890 --> 00:14:00,270
to keep it awake if it's not working VA

00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,160
for some reason perhaps you could record

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:05,550
some minutes for Twitter presuming it

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,800
works alright so this is a simple

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,959
example of triggering real-time drums on

00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,209
your phones every time I press a button

00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:19,170
they'll send real-time messages to your

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:20,820
phone to play a particular sound alright

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,670
notice that the drum sounds are all

00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,260
playing at the same time we're all

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,760
connected where we're connected to

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,620
arrange different networks or mobile

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,270
networks and even if we're on the same

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,640
network there's a range of different

00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:35,160
Layton sees even on a single phone from

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,730
one request to the next and this will be

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,470
even clearer if I trigger drumbeat to

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,650
play and this will probably sound pretty

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,650
bad

00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:55,780
yeah you can visualize the different

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,040
latencies on your phones by running some

00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,670
tests so if you can click the test

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,010
latency button on your phone and it'll

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:07,300
do a series of request responses with

00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:10,830
the real-time server and you'll likely

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:16,960
see some variance in your own device

00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:18,730
hey the graph is sorted all right so

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,830
what's this saying

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,010
most people are under 100 milliseconds

00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:27,280
which bodes pretty well I think for the

00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:29,590
rest of the talk so one approach to

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,270
dealing with latency is to get a shared

00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:33,430
understanding of what time it is on all

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,350
the phones if we can do that we can

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:39,430
schedule stands to play at a particular

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,810
time so phones generally keep the same

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,630
time but there's still enough of a

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,580
difference across phones that it would

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,560
wouldn't work for a drum machine and

00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,300
what we can't do though is ping the

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,870
server and measure how long it takes so

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,670
let's assume 20 milliseconds in toll and

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,300
we can assume that a request hop takes

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,160
about half the times 10 milliseconds and

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,500
if the server includes its time in the

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,890
response and we add the 10 milliseconds

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,970
to that and the phone has a pretty good

00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,920
understanding of what time it is

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,470
compared to the server so this is the

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:15,460
strategy we took when we run those

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:17,620
latency tests in your phone this graph

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,530
is showing the difference in time across

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,710
phones so phones on the Left are behind

00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:25,360
the server time phones on the right are

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:29,020
ahead of it pretty amazing that

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,370
everyone's almost on the same time so

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,330
let's see if it works let's see if it's

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:37,980
any better so I'll trigger trigger some

00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,980
sounds to play but in 1 seconds time

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,220
that seems better let's try the drum

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,220
machine

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:59,270
all right thanks so actually when I've

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,050
done that before this has more like

00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:11,959
that's not meant to work as well well

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:15,309
let me try just the iPhones alright

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:27,079
that's pretty good and the androids oh

00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:29,600
right and the androids well that's the

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:38,090
best Android is everyone I mean I I love

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:40,070
Android but their latency see I don't

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,290
think it's a real word but if it was I

00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,850
think there's a it this is kind of a

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,670
audio lies ation of Android

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:49,910
fragmentation just like an iOS the

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:52,460
operating system receives our JavaScript

00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,380
function to execute the send is received

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,360
and queued up at the right time it's

00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,220
just that there's a range of different

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,120
onboard Layton sees when it comes to

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:05,330
stand on androids one of the reasons why

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,640
different lag times are so noticeable is

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,860
that drum sounds have got a really sharp

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,679
attack time meaning all that sound kind

00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:16,100
of happens at once if we take a sound

00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:19,130
that's got a more gradual attack like

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,410
orchestral sounds and it allows us some

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,120
leeway with the latency so I've put

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,940
together twelve different orchestral

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,380
sounds from a section of Beethoven's

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:33,650
fifth symphony which I'll randomly

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:38,559
assign to different devices now alright

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:38,559
so this is about 40 seconds here we go

00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,650
it worked

00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,650
[Music]

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,980
all right now we have the phone synced

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,540
up let's bring in the house speakers so

00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,080
if you could choose which section of the

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:40,010
room you're in so left middle or right

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:43,130
if you'd like to participate so I'm

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,990
going to randomly assign some MIDI

00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,910
devices which are running on my machine

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,610
so this is a piece of software called

00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:51,410
Ableton Live which is a digital audio

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,530
workstation which is predominantly used

00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:57,170
for generating and performing electronic

00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,420
music and I've created a short track for

00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:02,270
this talk and others using for

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,690
synthesizers which you can see here if I

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,690
just play

00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:32,790
okay okay odyo is working okay so the

00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,100
black area on the right is also running

00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:38,820
the same ember up just in a different

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:42,179
role and I'm also running a local node

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:45,630
server which is subscribed to real-time

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,750
events and it translates these events

00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:52,110
into MIDI signals which are sent to

00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,760
Ableton Live so I've arranged it so for

00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:57,120
people and the audience can control

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,210
different parts that he synthesizes so

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:10,020
I'm gonna select someone at random

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:12,480
alright bthe sorcerer you move cool so

00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:23,220
I'm gonna solo your instrument and

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:28,470
enable the chorus and press play you can

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:31,440
explore the four corners the yellow box

00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,820
on the screen is where I put the

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,830
parameter when I was recording it but

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,830
you can put it anywhere you want music

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:43,860
his expression so let's pick someone

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:48,750
else for Pat - okay JP so let's try year

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:55,850
1 okay it's a similar synth but it's got

00:21:48,750 --> 00:22:04,429
different characteristics okay that's

00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:04,429
the third instrument okay Dan here we go

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,090
okay I'm down you're in smell will come

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,789
in after like 10 or 12 seconds you'll

00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:25,830
get you'll see it on the screen so let's

00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:30,960
pick a fourth instrument okay let me try

00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:35,130
okay that could just be random luck yeah

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,020
it was okay Benham your your instrument

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,500
number three done you're promoted to

00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,500
number four

00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:53,809
okay so let's see some buttons here go

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,809
to intro alright

00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:16,930
[Music]

00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,529
[Music]

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,460
[Music]

00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:53,059
[Music]

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,079
[Music]

00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:33,799
all right it sounds better when I

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:37,280
recorded it okay congratulations thanks

00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:40,090
everyone thanks for that so that's all I

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,090
have thanks very much
