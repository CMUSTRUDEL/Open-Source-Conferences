00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:32,200
hi everyone so yeah my name is Bryan

00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,809
Hughes you can find me everywhere online

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,420
at NAB rias Twitter github things like

00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:39,760
that yeah I work at Microsoft so today

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,559
I'm gonna be talking about anxiety and

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,600
queerness and kind of how that manifests

00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,560
myself and this like little app that I

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,260
built to help me with it first up if

00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,210
that's going to work do it there we go

00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,770
content warnings I am gonna be talking

00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,050
of course about mental illness I'm going

00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,329
to talking about homophobia growing up

00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:02,670
queer in the south so it's gonna be an

00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:06,360
intense talk but yeah so anxiety brain

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,369
all right I am giving up on that thing

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,200
so yeah I deal with a lot of anxiety

00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,820
it's something I've dealt with for a

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,909
long time although it took me a while to

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,040
realize it for a lot of reasons but is

00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,930
something where like my anxiety is kind

00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,820
of middle of the road I would say I

00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,200
definitely know people who deal who deal

00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,490
with anxiety that's a lot less than me

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,010
but also people deal with it and it's a

00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,210
lot more than me it's enough that I am

00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,270
in therapy it's something I have to

00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,770
manage and it manifests in a lot of

00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,479
different ways like mental illness for

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,119
most people it's always a little bit

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,610
different and so for me one of the big

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,740
things the way that anxiety manifests is

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,360
that I'm really bad about keeping in

00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,799
touch with people I really good about

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,939
being present like in the moment like

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,380
you know talking to you and I think I

00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,659
talked with a bunch of you last night

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,700
and like I'm great at that when it comes

00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:53,619
time to like reach out over text or DM

00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,479
email whatever you know just really

00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:57,640
working on that relationship I'm bad at

00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:01,090
it and it comes from social anxiety

00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,070
ultimately and a few other things so I

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,810
decided that this was an area where tech

00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,000
can help like the thing about mental

00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,679
illness is we're constantly managing it

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,970
you know it's not something that you

00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,819
take a pill and it's fixed it's

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,110
something that we have to work on and

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,670
sometimes we need tools to help us with

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,280
it and so I wrote this tool to help me

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,770
with this one very specific aspect of my

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,239
anxiety so I call a contact scheduler

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,890
I'm not particularly good at naming

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,580
things so it's pretty functional but it

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,400
works it

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,470
open source online GPL license you can

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,210
check it out so I created this I had a

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,310
couple of design goals in mind to make

00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,870
sure that it worked really well the

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,900
first thing that need to be as automated

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,670
as possible any time I have to go in and

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,830
do a thing that's a chance that I won't

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,910
do that thing and I found like I tried

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,890
in the past using just like a normal

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,100
calendar to add an entry to like hey

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,210
reach out to this person never works

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,740
largely because I forgot to just add

00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,420
stuff to it you know there was a human

00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,700
error element of it so I needed to

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,780
remove as much of that as possible and

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,720
the next one is that it needs to be

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,370
scheduled aware you know if I ever get a

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,720
notification saying hey do this thing

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,880
and I'm in the middle of like a meeting

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,800
that makes my anxiety worse not better

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,630
so a needs to be able to figure out like

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,080
when is actually a good time to tell me

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,450
about it

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,730
and then finally it needs to be low

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,190
stakes like the thing about anxiety is

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,420
it ratchets up pressure and then

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,800
whenever something else is pressuring it

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,810
gets worse and it gets into a bit of

00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,510
this cycle so it needs to be really low

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,670
stakes so when I designed it it looks

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,160
kind of like this there are three tabs

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,959
to it there's sort of a Home tab this

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,600
contacts having a calendar tab so on the

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,610
context tab I add in all the people I

00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,230
want to keep in touch with using

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,910
Futurama characters here because I like

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,920
to use them as placeholders and you

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,239
notice this is a very simple UI there's

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,470
very very little to it and that is

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,540
actually by design

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,100
this is still kind of beta so it's

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,330
missing some features but this page is

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:51,010
complete so in this page which I see is

00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,930
not on the monitor right now it's you

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,310
got a list of names and you add just a

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,140
name and half-free clear you want to

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,290
reach out to them very simple and that's

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,120
by design it does the rest for me and so

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,530
then on the home page each week it's

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,610
going to create a queue of people for me

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,200
to reach out to you know the sort of

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,180
interspersed set throughout the week and

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,130
it does it using a variety of pieces of

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,480
information you know how often I reach

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,400
out to someone when I last reached out

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,739
to them and a few other heuristics going

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,810
into it and so it's time to reach out to

00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,720
someone it gives me a notification that

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,830
looks like this now if you start looking

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,360
at this this is actually kind of

00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,550
different than a typical notification

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,050
even that may not be quite obvious the

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,600
biggest thing is compared to a calendar

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,450
there is no snooze or dismiss by design

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,370
so what I learned with a calendar is the

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,410
way it interacts with my anxiety and I

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,060
think a lot of people's anxiety is we

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,320
get a notification especially a calendar

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,930
notification and there's this

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,640
that we have to do it right then it's

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,960
like you must do this thing at this

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,860
moment I'm gonna keep bothering you

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,170
until you do

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,730
and that really spikes anxiety as it

00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,120
turns out like that is a UI pattern that

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,080
is bad for anxiety and now if you have a

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,760
meeting you have to get two at a time

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,050
that's just the nature of it but I like

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,520
reaching out to someone it doesn't

00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,840
matter if I do it now versus a half hour

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,780
from now it's just matters that I reach

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,760
out to that person so I changed this so

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,490
that there is no snooze and dismiss and

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,370
it's kind of an asynchronous UI pattern

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,630
this pops up for like 15 seconds and

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,700
then goes away on its own

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,380
so it's like an auto snooze and that's

00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,150
intentionally a very short period of

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,770
time so that actually can't respond to

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,870
it in that period of time the idea is it

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,070
pops up it gets the idea in my head like

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,390
oh yeah I need to reach out to this

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,160
person then goes away and this

00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,660
eventually I'll get around to it you

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,520
know when I have a few minutes but it's

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,960
there in my brain already it's kind of

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,060
taking up space and I remember to do it

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,380
and so whenever I do reach out to them I

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,180
actually have to wait for this to pop up

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,830
again and then that's when I hit respond

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,410
and then it will move on to the next

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,000
person sometimes there can be anxiety

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,650
around reaching out to a specific person

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,270
maybe I have to have a really difficult

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,560
conversation with them or it's been a

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,390
long time since I reached out to them

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,920
and I'm feeling anxious about the fact

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,240
that I haven't reached out to them so

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,290
sometimes just saying like okay I'm not

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,670
gonna do this person right now I'll

00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,650
reach out to someone else first that can

00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,210
kind of help to just like ease the

00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,400
anxiety and feel me it give me a little

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,900
more prep to do it again so that's how

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,000
that works you know remix in this

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,530
notification pattern has helped a lot

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,920
and like this is still beta stage like

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,150
this is not a particularly good

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,250
mechanism actually you know it can be a

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,350
lot better but it's already better than

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,700
what we have and I don't say this

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,380
because like I have some insight it I'm

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,430
actually a pretty bad UI UX designer

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,340
it's just that I don't think anyone's

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,350
ever tried to create a UI that works

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,700
with people's anxiety and and a little

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,110
bit I've been using this so far it has

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:27,010
made a difference so I think there's

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,470
something to it and so I implemented

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,060
this using electrons AS type script

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,230
because I love type script you know go

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,510
figure working for Microsoft

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,860
I used SQLite to store all the data in

00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,570
it that way it's on a file on your

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,340
laptop and you have control over that

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,630
you know this is ultima mapping

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,240
relationships so that is really

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,290
important private information and so you

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,930
know i don't want to deal with the

00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,850
privacy issues of going into the cloud

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,590
and then finally i'm not there yet but i

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,060
will be using the Microsoft graph API to

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,380
connect to my calendars in

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,940
during our proper times now you might be

00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,550
thinking to yourself that like wait did

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,440
Brian just finish talking about his app

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,380
in a you know 35 minute sock in the

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,780
first like ten minutes or so yes that is

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:11,050
exactly what I did the reason for that

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,060
is mental health doesn't exist in a

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,680
vacuum and there's always more to the

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,510
story

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,220
my mental held you know anxiety isn't

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,350
this like thing that exists in a

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,270
crystalline form under a glass jar

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,990
somewhere it is intertwined with

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,490
everything else in my life and so to

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,330
understand my anxiety you kind of have

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:35,620
to understand where I came from and that

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,540
truth is I am a bisexual polyamorous

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,120
atheist who's born and raised in various

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:46,180
parts of Texas in New Mexico not called

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:49,270
Austin and so I was born in Houston

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,070
Texas in 1982 now that actually means

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,570
that I'm older than I look I'm older

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,010
than you probably think I am I am

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,080
technically a gen Xer according to

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:59,289
pretty much every definition and that

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,550
actually matters as it turns out so the

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:02,350
born in Houston lived there for three

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,669
years moved to a place in Texas or in

00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,280
New Mexico sorry called Truth or

00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,610
Consequences that one little star kind

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,960
of a New Mexico side and I lived there

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,970
for like four years so then I moved to

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,740
Denton Texas which is in the north part

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,410
of the dallas-fort Worth Metroplex and I

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,669
spent all of my adolescence there all

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,789
the way through high school and then I

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:25,260
went to college in Lubbock Texas now

00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:28,479
taxes in general is a strange place

00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,310
suffice to say and Denton is a strange

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,550
place inside of a strange state as is

00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,750
Lubbock so Texas the thing is known for

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,830
well one of the things that's known for

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,200
is that there's a university there

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,880
called the University of North Texas

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,159
turns out they have the number two jazz

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,599
program in the nation you know now

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,890
actually my family did that's why I

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,430
removed my dad wanted to go back to

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,660
school but outside of Texas it's on the

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,200
very northern part of the metric so it's

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,910
surrounded by farmland and this town was

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,830
basically had this very tiny artistic

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,630
core and then a bunch of that was

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,010
liberal and a lot of really conservative

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,080
folks right around it we're kind of all

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,990
mixed together then Lubbock though was

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,270
sort of the opposite of that Lubbock

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,220
when I lived there was rated as the

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,230
second most conservative city in the

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,260
nation with a population over like a

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,350
hundred thousand I think so that is more

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,790
what you would expect so I'm giving you

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,640
this idea in your head like I grew up in

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,840
Texas career person from there you might

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,200
have to be thinking you know what that's

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,160
like but you're probably wrong actually

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,530
yes these places are incredibly

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,210
conservative but it doesn't manifest the

00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,380
way most liberal folks think and this is

00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,570
a struggle that I have trying to

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,450
describe it all the time so most people

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,440
think that like homophobia racism things

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,720
like that in the south

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,640
looks like KKK members burning crosses

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,110
or the Westboro Baptist Church picketing

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,110
funerals with signs saying that people

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,290
like me are going to hell that exists

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:52,570
but it's a very very tiny proportion

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,380
like there's only 5,000 KKK members in

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:58,180
the entire United States and that's a

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,540
super tiny fraction of the south because

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,640
the thing is most big between the south

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,090
doesn't look like overt violence it's a

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,190
lot more subtle and a lot more pervasive

00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,410
like the south is I think more racist

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,660
and homophobic and everything else and

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:17,560
you think it is but not in the way you

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,630
think it is at all and unfortunately

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,250
like the thing that I see about this all

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,720
the time is there's this strong man

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,740
construction created of the south

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,270
and what I always see especially white

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,130
liberal folks doing with this is they

00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:32,200
say like this is what bigotry looks like

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,430
this is what racism looks like so I'm

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,980
not racist because I'm nothing like this

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,500
thing I just made up and that's actually

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,970
how this conversation goes down so I've

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,050
also lived in San Island San Francisco

00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,240
now and I lived there for almost a

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,630
decade so I know San Francisco as well

00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,960
and the truth is San Francisco is racist

00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:52,240
as seriously look at the history of

00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,070
it or look at the current numbers on it

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,590
San Francisco the population of San

00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,020
Francisco is only 3% african-american

00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:02,680
that is the lowest of any major city in

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,970
the entire United States by far like San

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,700
Francisco managed to somehow beat up

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:09,000
Phoenix Arizona for having fewer

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,780
african-american folks

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,420
Arizona

00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,790
and and this is not an accident either

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,880
if you look at the history of it San

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:23,120
Francisco actively chased out

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,340
african-americans and we see this going

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,920
on today

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,270
and the thing is is that like bigotry in

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,210
the South doesn't look that different

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,710
than bigotry in the West Coast and for

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,540
me what that meant growing up though is

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,720
like so Texas is a weird thing it's not

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,520
quite the south it's like the south

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,380
sibling a younger sibling in a way and

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,360
it gets a lot of its culture from the

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,370
south later also get some culture from

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,110
the Midwest and so what this means in

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:50,870
culture especially when I was growing up

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,270
is that you just didn't talk about

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,300
anything controversial that was like a

00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,060
major social faux pas it was out of turn

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,270
you just didn't do it

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,740
the thing is that when I was growing up

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:08,180
queerness was controversial so you

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:11,180
didn't talk about it ever and like this

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:14,320
is it's especially complicated for me

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,580
because I'm bisexual I'm not gay and

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,890
there is a bit of a difference and

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:23,839
growing up I knew that I was interested

00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:25,460
in women dot dot dot but like yeah

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,960
growing up especially when I was young

00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,280
like I grew up with that Internet the

00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,110
internet didn't come around until I was

00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,240
in middle school and even back then it

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,950
was not like we had today there wasn't a

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,930
way for me to find community online

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,430
there wasn't a way for me to research

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,170
even what Karina's was like that just

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,630
didn't exist and there wasn't

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,100
representation in media either like Will

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,450
& Grace when come on until I was in high

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,220
school career I for the straight guy

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,040
it's original main one come on till I

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,690
was in college like I had no role models

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,760
in media I didn't even know what

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,950
bisexuality was until like my junior in

00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:01,000
high school and I am bi like I didn't

00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:03,110
know what I was and and it's not like

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,640
people not talking about this was like

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,720
oh it's just not a big deal we're not

00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,550
gonna talk about no this was the

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,950
elephant in the room that everyone knew

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,460
was there and you could feel it like I

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,570
could feel the presence of it growing up

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,280
but I didn't know what it was I just

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,680
knew there was something and I knew that

00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,170
something involved me and not just

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,990
because how I felt but because of how

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,110
others felt like I knew I was somehow

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,279
other

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,440
going up and not just in that like

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,209
teenage angsty no one understands me way

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,620
like we all go through that that's not

00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:34,019
what I'm talking about this is something

00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:40,980
where I knew others were treating me

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:42,029
like and like that sunk in I think about

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,649
growing up queer is like I mean

00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,360
everyone's story is different and it

00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:47,610
depends a lot on the culture we grow

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,220
around up and but pretty much all of us

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,440
deal with homophobia growing up and we

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,910
internalize it because when we're young

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,880
when we're kids before we hit puberty

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,810
very very few of us actually know that

00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,880
we're queer

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:02,610
like that's something that usually we

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,560
have to get to puberty to find out not

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,790
always but usually and so what happens

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,950
growing up when we grow up in these

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,660
environments we grow up in a place where

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,600
homophobia is the norm and we learned

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,339
that first we learn that there's

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,970
something wrong with being queer and

00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:20,040
later we find out that we are queer and

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,570
we can't just turn that switch off so we

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,100
internalize it that's what we mean when

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,500
we say internalized homophobia or

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,260
internalized racism or anything else is

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,899
that we learn what the culture wants

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,449
before we learn what we are and then we

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,730
have to reconcile that somehow in a lot

00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:38,220
of places where homophobia looks like

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,170
violence which is a lot of places that

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,230
gets internalized as hatred and

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:45,570
self-loathing but like that wasn't

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,680
exactly what I dealt with growing up and

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,029
for a long time I actually thought that

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,310
I just somehow like dodged a bullet with

00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:52,110
this that somehow I was like a lucky one

00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,570
because I don't have that kind of

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,500
internalized homophobia but it is there

00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,170
and this is something I've learned

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,779
recently is that for me internalized

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,449
homophobia doesn't look like violence

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:06,029
and hate it looks like self-denial and

00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:08,610
gaslighting because that's what happened

00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:11,040
when I was a kid the oppression of

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,050
knowledge was so thorough that I didn't

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,880
even know there was something for me to

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,740
find out about myself I knew there was

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,360
something but I didn't know what and I

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,970
didn't have the tools to find it out and

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,560
no one to show me the way so that part

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:26,670
of me just got cut off and put in a box

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,110
because I knew what's attracted women I

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,720
did kind of figure out eventually that

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,910
like being gay was a thing once again I

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,319
knew I wasn't gay and at the time that

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,790
was the only thing that got in about

00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:38,520
queerness at all at least some men and

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,160
so I knew I wasn't gay but I knew there

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,779
was something else

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,129
so I just thought maybe I was broken

00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:45,730
like there was a crossed wire or

00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:47,379
something in my brain and like that got

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,940
internalized that just oh there's this

00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,410
weird thing going on but like the

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,480
culture we don't talk about it so I'm

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,670
just gonna shove it aside and not think

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,899
about it and I did that to myself like

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:01,269
this is by erasure pure and simple and I

00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,730
erase myself and I'm not the only one

00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:10,750
this is a very common story among by

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:12,250
folks very common and so I knew I had to

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,779
get out of Texas though especially once

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,699
again to college I kind of started

00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:17,800
figuring some of this out like I didn't

00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:20,860
know this in high school I mean I knew

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,129
there was something I knew yeah I knew

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,750
the way other people treated me I knew

00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:28,389
when Matthew Shepard was tortured and

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,189
murdered for being gay that that struck

00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:33,699
a chord me that I didn't understand but

00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:35,680
I knew I was afraid like that was high

00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:38,740
school for me and then college wasn't

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,910
much better I started figuring this out

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,529
just because I'm getting older but now

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,149
is in a much much more conservative

00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,470
place the kind of place where it's not

00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,019
just everyone is Christian that's just

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,519
the way it is in Texas but this place it

00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,500
was like at least half of the city was

00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:53,620
young earth creationist evangelical

00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,779
style of Christianity and so like living

00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,850
in that even more press and I just I had

00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:59,709
to cut that side off for me in order to

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,449
keep myself safe and I know now that

00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:03,009
what I did was I put myself in the

00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:06,449
closet without even knowing that closet

00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:10,000
was there and I stayed in it for decades

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:13,150
I'm in my late 30s now getting there and

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,140
so I'm starting to really work on this

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,760
and like I said I've been at San

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,079
Francisco for a decade and so you might

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,339
think okay I moved to San Francisco

00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,909
which is a you know a great place for

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:23,470
queer folks it really is and you would

00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:26,500
think that that would just fix it but it

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:28,059
didn't it's not just about escape

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,080
getting physically away from where

00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:32,140
you're out but you have to get away from

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:36,370
it mentally too and I'm still stuck

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:39,010
there in a lot of ways and of course see

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,230
like I said San Francisco is not perfect

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,059
far from it like what I have learned you

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,799
know I do have a lot of street friends

00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:46,809
historically the majority of my friends

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,190
have been straight and in San Francisco

00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:50,380
I learned that you know it's a very

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,630
accepting welcoming place for queer

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,100
folks but

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,300
as long as you stay in line you know

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,180
there's certain ways that will they

00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,370
expect us to express our queerness but

00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,720
as soon as we start calling out

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,010
on the part of our straight friends

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,080
there in San Francisco all of a sudden

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,440
then we become the device the divisive

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,210
ones

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,340
we're the ones causing trouble why don't

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,660
we just all get along and this isn't

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,040
just queer folks this happens to you by

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,690
the way this is people of colors the

00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,720
disabled this is the same story being

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:22,020
told over and over again even in liberal

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:23,760
areas and even in activist circles like

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,870
so I'm something of an activist if you

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,860
follow me online you might have seen

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,180
some of the things I've done I was

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,590
involved in the node.js project for a

00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,660
long time trying to change things there

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:34,200
and I've done a few other things more

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:38,040
recently and activism is a it's a weird

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,360
weird thing it's like we tend to think

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,010
of activism I was like oh I'm gonna go

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,690
protest as family go hold a sign and

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,370
chant and that is a part of it that's an

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,590
important part of activism but it's just

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,970
one piece a lot of the other work we

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,410
have to do is more diplomacy and

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,540
politics and like that's what I did

00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,950
that's the style I did and what I didn't

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,990
know going in those when you do that

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,490
you're not calling out someone on the

00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,680
other side of a line who you don't know

00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,970
they're faceless and nameless you're

00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,690
calling out your colleagues you're

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:06,360
calling out your friends and that in

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,370
some ways made my night in some ways it

00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,350
absolutely made my anxiety worse you

00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,790
know my anxiety comes from growing up it

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,300
comes from not being able to trust

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,950
people

00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,570
it comes from keeping people at a

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,360
distance because that's how I stay safe

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:20,400
and I still struggle to trust people I

00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,500
still struggle to open up a lot like I'm

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:28,620
an incredibly difficult person to get to

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:31,800
know I really am and it's not a great

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,870
thing for me I know that in activism in

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,970
some ways has made this worse because I

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,770
had to work with colleagues and friends

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,990
people that were causing problems saying

00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:44,070
hey you're being an but also

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,270
people who I saw being hurt and one of

00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,800
the hardest things I've ever had to do

00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:49,590
was in the know project I remember this

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,930
vividly having to tell people I care a

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,580
lot about who were being hurt that I

00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,550
can't do anything for you right now

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,080
because if I do it'll make things worse

00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,390
and we're gonna lose whatever chance we

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,560
had and I think that made that even

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,480
harder was a few months later when I

00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,799
thought we had our chance tried it and

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,379
we failed anyways it only proved me

00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:13,950
right to tell these people that I can't

00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:16,720
help you in that it's hard still

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:20,889
and it just it draw it has pulled me

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,110
away from people even more and so yeah

00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:26,350
I'm anxious all the time because I have

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,429
to deal with this kind of it never

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,840
stops

00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,059
like most of the time it's just a low

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,919
hum in the background you know something

00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:34,299
I just kind of keeps me on edge keeps me

00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,590
hanging perhaps a bit too much from a

00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,440
perfectionist but you know it still

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,200
works well or it works I can deal with

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,509
it easily enough it's not a big deal

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:47,019
most of the time then there's those

00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:49,330
other times where my anxiety gets bad

00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:51,299
enough that I can't work like I can't

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,619
really maintain relationships

00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,789
thank God I can work from home which by

00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,499
the way pro tip for anyone who has

00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:58,659
control over this if you want to help

00:20:56,499 --> 00:21:05,830
people with mental health allow them to

00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:07,359
work from home because if you could be

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,609
on the fly on the wall on my really

00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:12,220
really bad anxieties you see me pacing

00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:14,619
my apartment I cannot sit still I cannot

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,299
focus and being at home does help though

00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:21,369
because of it at least it's in a calm

00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:22,690
comfortable place but it's always there

00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:25,330
even when it's not that and thankfully

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,129
that's rare just you know half a dozen

00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,889
times a year maybe a dozen times a year

00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:31,749
like it's not that common at least

00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:35,379
doesn't feel that way to me but it

00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:37,929
happens the reverse is even rarer though

00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:39,759
on occasion my anxiety actually will

00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:43,389
completely go away it's usually fleeting

00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,649
just for a few minutes but I really love

00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,989
those moments because like for this

00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:49,179
brief moment I can see the kind of

00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:53,139
person I would be otherwise I could see

00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:55,480
who I would be without anxiety and I'm a

00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:57,999
much that that version of me is a much

00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,419
better person I wish I could be that

00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:04,749
person all the time but I can't I was

00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:06,879
never given that choice growing up my

00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:10,600
defense mechanisms were honed to a fine

00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:12,159
point I had to like and this is the

00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,070
truth that a lot of queer people grow up

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:18,090
especially when we grow up alone without

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:20,190
support as it hardens us

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,380
we don't have a choice in this either

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,610
and we don't know how to do it in ways

00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,740
that are healthy either because we have

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,120
to learn it on our own we don't have

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,200
people who actually understand this we

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,750
don't have therapists to talk to

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,490
especially in conservative places today

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,400
and a lot of Kurt's Irvington places

00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,020
therapists still treat weirdness as a

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,760
mental illness and for a long time it

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,520
was officially classified as a mental

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,690
illness but that just makes things worse

00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:52,900
it's not true obviously and it's harmful

00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:55,870
it's hurtful and so like I'm just I'm

00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:59,140
left dealing with this in a lot of ways

00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:01,090
it feels like it feels like a part of my

00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,340
life was stolen from me honestly like I

00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,750
am Who I am because of things outside my

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,490
control that I never had control over

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,840
and the fact that it was so subtle

00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,210
growing up it was never explicitly

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,190
mentioned I didn't know there's always

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,750
this thing conservatives like to say

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,890
queer people oh you're just confused

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,450
well you know what your goddamn

00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,360
right I was confused because you made me

00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:25,929
confused you never allowed me to gain

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:27,970
clarity and that is harmful like being

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:30,520
stuck in a closet you don't even know is

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,520
there but you know the feeling of it you

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:41,950
know that shame coming in from it that

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:43,210
lasts that sticks and like I think I'm

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,400
gonna be this way the rest of my life I

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,900
really do I'm getting better like I said

00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,760
I've been in therapy and that it does

00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,890
make a difference it really does help if

00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,950
you are struggling get into therapy

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,679
please it really does help I know it's

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:59,590
scary I was terrified whenever I first

00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:03,280
got in but it really does help and make

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,840
a difference we got to remember this and

00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,880
we got to remember this in our cultures

00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,590
and our companies that there are a lot

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,640
of people struggling with mental illness

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,160
and that comes from a lot of places

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,790
that's always intertwined with something

00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,800
else like for me whenever my anxiety

00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,940
spikes it's not like a random thing

00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,470
that's unpredictable there's always

00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,460
something that spikes it I mean a lot of

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,770
times it actually comes back to

00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,150
queerness in some way or fashion not

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,910
always its creative sir activism at the

00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:33,429
very least I should say

00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,840
and it's hard and it's especially hard

00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,910
knowing that this isn't something that's

00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,600
just in the past and done with like this

00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:43,630
is still going on I remember I had met

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,160
this one guy I'm at a conference and a

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,500
much more conservative place a while ago

00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,390
and he was from there he had just moved

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,520
to San Francisco like a couple months

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:53,710
prior to the Castro he talked about how

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,900
excited he was to be there and how

00:24:53,710 --> 00:25:00,250
awesome it was and I saw myself in him

00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,540
like I knew exactly where he's coming

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,190
from and what he was thinking

00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,300
and when he said that he was excited to

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,790
be there what he really meant was that

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,940
he finally felt safe and free to be

00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:11,980
himself but I know it's not quite that

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,140
simple I know you can't just flick a

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:19,990
switch on that and it's all better

00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:22,570
I probably and I had the responsibility

00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:25,410
to tell him all of this I think but I

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:28,120
just couldn't do it I just couldn't I

00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:31,720
couldn't bring myself to tell him that

00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,120
like you're not out of the woods that

00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,600
San Francisco isn't perfect that this is

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,400
going to haunt you I just I I couldn't

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,880
do that to him at that moment but it

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,880
sticks with me

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,610
and I don't have an ending for the sock

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,590
by the way and not because I didn't get

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,059
around to it like I do a lot of public

00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,559
speaking I know how to formulate a talk

00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:57,289
I know how to do a plot structure I know

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,000
how to bring it in I don't have a talk

00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,019
for this the I don't have an ending for

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,179
this talk because I don't have an ending

00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:03,529
to my story a lot of times when I do

00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:05,330
culture talks I ended with a call to

00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:07,490
action I'm like you know if you could

00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:12,049
all do one thing do this one thing it'll

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:14,990
make things better there's no call to

00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:16,730
action for this like the damage has been

00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,110
done I'm gonna be dealing with this for

00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,120
the rest of my life and queer people

00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,529
today even younger than me are still

00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,960
gonna be dealing with this for the rest

00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:25,940
of our lives there is no amount of

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,250
apology there was no amount of

00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,960
reparations that can undo the damage

00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,549
done in the past and this is not just

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,679
for queer folks this is for people of

00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:38,679
color this is for disabled folks for

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,679
anyone else on the outside of society

00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,510
there is no call to action for this we

00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:47,120
have to do better but it can never be

00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:52,190
fixed especially while the damage is

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,720
still being done today but one thing I

00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,000
will say though is to anyone in the room

00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,590
who is queer or listening online for the

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
recording of this especially if you're

00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:05,269
still in the closet find your community

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,720
you don't have to do it alone don't stay

00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:10,789
in the closet alone like I did because

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,309
that is the loneliest place in the world

00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:17,830
find your community find that support so

00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:17,830
that hopefully it can blunt the damage

00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:23,990
but you know it's already done for me so

00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:27,110
I just have to keep dealing going

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:28,730
forward and you know building tiny

00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:33,059
little JavaScript apps tell me with the

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:35,120
details thank you

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:35,120
