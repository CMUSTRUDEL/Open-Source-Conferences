[Music]

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,689
so next person we have is Patricia she

00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,450
is the creator of gay fi where you can

00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:34,510
make your software gay and your

00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,460
debugging more colorful okay and even

00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,829
cooler than that she can do the splits

00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,469
when I make a dude on stage today but

00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:44,110
that's awesome so me later

00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:50,820
ask her later so please give a warm

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:54,340
welcome for Patricia thanks everyone

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,140
so thanks for coming to my talk thanks

00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:00,460
for making it through end of the day you

00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:03,250
know it's been busy conference day so my

00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:10,750
talk a tale of two bundles a lesson in

00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:13,930
mentorship so before I dive in Who am I

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,990
I'm Patricia I'm a back-end software

00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:20,080
engineer at Tkaczyk in Washington DC and

00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:24,700
you can follow me and tweet at me at

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,830
queer Pat so in this talk I'm gonna be

00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,100
speaking about my journey of breaking

00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:32,560
into tech as a bootcamp grad to become a

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,080
back-end software engineer as a queer

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:40,630
Latinas woman with a degree in the

00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:42,430
humanities in my talk today I'll be

00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,520
highlighting the vital differences

00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,920
between a negative mentor who actually

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,710
blocks underrepresented folks from

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,780
breaking into tech further perpetuating

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,900
the leaders hierarchy omnipresent

00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,390
throughout the tech companies versus an

00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,880
invaluable mentor who nurtures and

00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,189
sponsors their mentees by leveraging any

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,460
privilege that they have to open career

00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:09,129
opportunities for their mentees then I

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,890
will further examine how exactly to

00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:14,129
become an effective mentor and sponsor

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,510
for underrepresented folks in tech and

00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:19,400
this is going to be through my own

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:23,620
personal ends and lived experiences

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:27,140
so a little bit of background about me

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,750
so years ago I had a dead-end job as a

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:33,080
textbook copy editor at a major

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:36,140
educational publisher fed up with the

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,260
lack of opportunities I would go home

00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:42,829
after work and teach myself Python some

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:48,230
JavaScript I really wanted to try and

00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:51,069
incorporate programming into my job at

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,890
my job at the textbook company we had

00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:56,780
online versions of our textbooks and

00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,859
they were you can interact with them

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:04,940
through a CMS and I you know taught

00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:09,290
myself HTML and CSS to edit our

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:12,799
textbooks so at the textbook company I

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:17,750
got really fed up I really wanted to

00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:20,239
pursue programming more seriously so I

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:24,019
moved cross-country to attend a Python

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,180
coding boot camp in San Francisco when I

00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:28,760
lived in San Francisco for the two years

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,489
after attending boot camp I grew a lot

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,280
technically I pushed myself by

00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:36,829
constantly coding and building side

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,190
projects learning new programming

00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:42,349
concepts as much as I could

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,859
learning so many new skills as quickly

00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:47,780
as I did resulted in a lot of

00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:51,609
metaphorical growing pains learning is

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:54,079
hard learning takes energy and effort

00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:57,769
continuously stretching your mind is

00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:00,620
draining and applying for software

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:06,799
engineer jobs is very time consuming and

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:09,099
energy draining so my non-traditional

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,930
path into tech was very challenging

00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:14,329
sometimes I was so frustrated and

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,760
disillusioned with the tech industry and

00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,949
the Game of Thrones battle that is

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,820
technical interviewing I wanted to give

00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:25,010
up a lot it really felt that all of my

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,900
efforts until learning becoming more

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,210
technical and finishing lengthy

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,460
technical challenges were all in vain I

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,800
felt like I certainly had to prove

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,639
myself over and

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,050
over again in these tech interviews and

00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,259
job searching becomes even more

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,419
frustrating when your mentors in a way

00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:46,090
Gaslight you from progressing

00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:50,349
career-wise and discourage you from

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:52,960
applying to technical positions so for

00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:55,569
more context my boot camp actually

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,409
assigned its students mentors from the

00:04:55,569 --> 00:05:01,120
software engineering community so not

00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:03,699
only did these boot camp

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,000
mentors tell me I was not ready to start

00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:09,669
interviewing which is that's one piece

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,219
but then they never guided me on what

00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:15,460
technical topics I should study to best

00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:18,669
prepare for technical interviewing these

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,780
boot camp mentors made what I think is

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:24,430
an unfair judgment call blocking me from

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:30,699
network opportunities to further my

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:33,280
career these pre assigned mentors from

00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:36,849
my boot camp did in fact mentor me in

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,840
the sense that they tutored me they

00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:43,949
tutored me with computer science

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:47,110
concepts but they failed to sponsor me

00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:49,930
they failed to architect a long-term

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,169
plan with me and what exactly I wanted

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,449
to accomplish in my programming career

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:58,630
in my opinion mentorship should not just

00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:00,550
consists of only tutoring mentees but

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,729
also opening out potential job

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,710
opportunities as well as architecting a

00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:10,750
plan on how to accomplish the mentees

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:12,940
long-term goals so during this point of

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,430
my journey it definitely felt like these

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,180
bootcamp mentors were in a way

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:22,870
weaponizing my junior 'no Segen Smee I

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:25,990
felt tokenized so that white software

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,940
engineer men got Ally cookies from

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,300
mentoring me so that they could feel

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:34,000
good about themselves it's not a great

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:39,099
feeling to be surrounded by these pseudo

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,139
Ally allies who want to feel woke it was

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,719
very discouraging because I felt like my

00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,899
boot camp mentors did not have faith in

00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,899
me

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:56,260
so with the long job hunt a little bit

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,110
of context for my very long job hunt in

00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,630
breaking into tech so after finishing my

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,550
boot camp I had managed to cobble

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,370
together about a year's worth of

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:10,060
technical experience via a contract job

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:14,310
an open-source fellowship I was awarded

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:19,960
at github as well as an internship at a

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:22,630
tech health start-up so my internship at

00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,650
the tech health startup was supposedly

00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:28,990
for a position that was contract to hire

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:33,180
contractor hired positions were very

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:35,680
common amongst boot camp graduates so

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,350
unfortunately after a round of layoffs

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,130
neither myself nor any of my fellow

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:45,550
bootcamp grad software engineer interns

00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:48,100
received full-time offers so and thus

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:51,340
began my very long nine months a job

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:56,350
hunt so during this job hunt I

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:58,950
experienced many lows external factors

00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:02,860
made the job hunt particularly difficult

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:06,760
at one point I had unstable housing in

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:09,550
San Francisco all the while trying to

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,880
not resort moving back in with my

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:15,430
homophobic parents who I was not out to

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,410
at the time and I really feared a

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:21,670
negative reaction from them if they ever

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:24,610
found out I was queer so I was balancing

00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,350
adulting which is really hard while also

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:30,040
trying to survive these super long

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:32,200
technical interviewing processes many

00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,830
times honestly I felt like I was being

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,520
hazed by the tech industry I felt like I

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:41,039
was a so many like trivia like

00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:45,190
algorithms and data structure questions

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,990
that were completely and extremely far

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,950
removed from the day-to-day job of a

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:52,790
software engineer I had so many awkward

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:56,540
pair programming

00:08:52,790 --> 00:09:00,020
or men would just silently watch me code

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,960
judging me for solving their problem in

00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:09,880
a very unique way that they had never

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:16,580
seen before so oops

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:18,590
excuse me so my lowest point in my

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,660
nine-month technical interviewing

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:25,370
journey was actually towards the end of

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:27,830
my search so by this point of my job

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,560
search I had failed so many times in

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,460
past technical interviews I was actually

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,170
like fairly decent at making it past

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:40,190
technical homework challenges as well as

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:42,470
technical phone screens and had a decent

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,420
rate at making it to final on-site

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:51,620
interviews so my absolute rock bottom

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:54,370
low point was during a week-long paid

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:58,220
final on-site interview at a software

00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:01,160
engineering consulting firm essentially

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:05,330
it was like a short-term freelancing

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,190
opportunity so this was what was going

00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,010
through my mind I almost didn't even

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:13,220
accept the week-long interview requests

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:17,110
because this particular consultancy at

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:20,090
the time was ten men there was no women

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,390
you know the fact that their interview

00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:27,250
process included a week of vetting their

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:30,470
applicants made it obvious to me that

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:33,740
most of their applicants weren't parents

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,810
or caregivers or you know any developers

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,710
with time-consuming responsibilities

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:44,390
outside of the office and then it also

00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:48,590
let me know that the applicants applying

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:51,380
to this consultancy they must have not

00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,730
had full-time jobs as taking a week off

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,380
of work for most people

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:59,660
is untenable especially taking a week

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:03,280
off of like childcare or elder care

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:06,100
responsibilities it's just unreachable

00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,709
so unfortunately

00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,380
regardless of these red flags I ended up

00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:14,440
doing a week of freelancing with them

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,319
because I needed the money I had to pay

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,790
my bills and my funds were scarce since

00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:24,160
this was such a long job search so it

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,170
was obvious to me from like the first

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,300
hour of freelancing with this

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:32,949
consultancy that was a very bad but this

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,670
consultancy was dogmatic about using

00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:39,519
them as a text editor of choice to

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:42,250
contrast I love using Adam as my text

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,069
editor so during my week of freelancing

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,800
I had to pair a program with each

00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:51,040
consultant and it became extremely

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,920
difficult to pair since every consultant

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,490
have their own super customized than

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,800
bindings so ended up unfortunately

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:04,120
happening was that every consultant was

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,850
dravite getting so like both driving as

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,730
well as navigating in pair programming

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:13,319
speak so it's very difficult to

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:18,639
collaborate with them as they were

00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:20,199
hogging the keyboard you know just it

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,509
just seemed like they just didn't want

00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:26,889
to collaborate with me or share context

00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:29,639
with me it was just very difficult I

00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:33,759
even brought up the fact to them that

00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:36,130
exclusively using them was a major

00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:39,339
obstacle for me since when trying to

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,889
collaborate I'm obviously much slower at

00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:44,980
collaborating than the fellow

00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:47,800
consultants there and unfortunately I

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,990
was met with a lot of pushback and quite

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,610
frankly text-editor elitism so it was

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:57,540
really unfortunate so unfortunately this

00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:02,730
week and did very poorly

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:06,540
I believe it ended in medical flames

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:09,399
because towards the end of the last day

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:13,269
the engineers they took me out to lunch

00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:16,899
I was kind of like a goodbye lunch and

00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:18,400
so unfortunately one of the white

00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:21,400
software engineers

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,830
like extremely like races anti-black

00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:28,089
joke to the only black software engineer

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:29,620
in the consultancy and so i would and he

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:31,210
made this joke in front of me you know

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:35,680
like my jaw dropped

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:37,839
i couldn't believe what he had said i

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,970
was speechless

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,300
unfortunately didn't speak up I didn't

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,370
say anything I wish I did I was just I

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,400
was just shocked I didn't know what to

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,400
say

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:54,339
so that was by far the lowest point of

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:57,070
my job search I was seriously

00:13:54,339 --> 00:14:01,300
considering just quitting tech as an

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:04,240
industry altogether you know I felt

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:07,839
super other during the end of that

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,720
freelancing gig you know I feel like I

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,900
didn't belong and you know if one of

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:18,010
these like software engineers at this

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:21,790
consultancy obviously treated the black

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:25,180
software engineer poorly like how would

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:30,730
they cheat me like they wouldn't treat

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:33,400
me well if I had worked there so

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:36,370
thankfully things started to look up in

00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,290
my programming journey so in spite of

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,660
all of this hazing and all these

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,420
prejudice prejudice is embedded and

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,910
technical interviewing I'm here I've

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:49,110
successfully broken into tech as a

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:52,209
full-time back-end software engineer

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:55,660
with the guidance of mentors and support

00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:59,470
from friends I persisted I survived a

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:02,140
lot of adversity and I was driven to

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:06,160
find a company to accept me for my

00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:08,170
authentic self in my opinion it's my

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,930
strong belief that I did not break into

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:14,200
tech by relentlessly improving my

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,610
programming skills because I personally

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,940
knew many people who had landed

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:22,360
full-time jobs who were definitely less

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:24,550
technical than I were I was I believe

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,589
that the rosy narrative that coding boot

00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,920
camps market to their students that if

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:32,250
they just diligently study computers

00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,620
concepts and build side projects to

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,660
extend their programming skills that

00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,089
their hard work will pay off in an

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,760
attractive software engineering job I

00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:44,940
believe this is like an incomplete false

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,699
narrative in my opinion I was able to

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,980
successfully break into the gatekeeping

00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:52,440
that is technical interviewing was

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,829
because I made strong connections in the

00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,019
career not man community I have this

00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:01,290
queer community to thank for opening up

00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:03,930
wonderful career opportunities these

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,240
more experienced queer not men Engineers

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:09,930
lent me some of their privilege by

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,540
mentoring me and sponsoring me mentoring

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:15,300
especially for underrepresented folks in

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:19,079
tech not only should include helping

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,720
mentees solidify technical concepts but

00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:30,600
also open doors for them in networking

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:33,660
and new employment opportunities so an

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,940
important facet of being a great mentor

00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,300
is not just teaching mentees about

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,790
technical concepts but opening up

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,490
opportunities and also architecting a

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:48,060
future plan of what goals a mentee wants

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:50,430
to accomplish over time so this really

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,649
contrasts with my negative experience

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:58,230
with my pre-assigned mentors from my

00:16:52,649 --> 00:17:01,410
coding boot camp so I was sponsored by

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,779
the queer community they leveraged their

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,449
own personal networks to introduce me to

00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:09,510
recruiters and hiring managers they used

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:11,850
their name to vouch on my behalf would

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,650
tell potential employers that I'm an

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:16,549
excellent communicator that I learned

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:19,350
fast and I'm a good team player

00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:27,350
thankfully this enabled me to land my

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:30,840
first full-time software engineer job so

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:34,799
this all happened because I was very

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:38,000
lucky that I was thankfully paired up

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,250
with my wonderful mentor cut my tongue

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,440
CLI engineer and pee

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:47,180
who is a major positive force in my

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:49,130
journey in tech so I first talked to Kat

00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:52,190
via this inclusive slack community

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,930
called we all J yes we all jus is a

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,750
unique in the sense that it's an

00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:59,090
experiment to see if a very diverse

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,070
group of Internet strangers interested

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:04,690
in JavaScript could get along and not

00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:08,720
devolve into you know antagonist ik

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,880
argumentative environment so about two

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,160
years ago and we all join us there was a

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,590
call for mentorship where

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,270
underrepresented folks were looking to

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:22,040
break into tech could be paired with a

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:24,320
more senior experienced mentor so I was

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,530
very lucky cat chose me as mentee

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,240
I chose Kat as a mentor and it just

00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,930
happened to be that we are both queer

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,210
and quad Rican I'm very lucky to have a

00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:37,760
wise mentor that is also queer and

00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,770
Puerto Rican like myself as there aren't

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:51,170
many queer Puerto Rican and non mint

00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:56,780
engineers in tuk all right excuse me I

00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:59,140
got kind of out of out of sync with my

00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,140
slides

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,900
okay

00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:16,240
all right cool so an important pillar of

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:18,640
mentorship is technical guidance so can

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,370
I would go over technical concepts such

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,309
as how does the internet work and what

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:26,320
is restfulness I would also ask Kat

00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:29,770
questions on how to go about solving

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,990
coding challenges like big picture wise

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,960
like what data structure should I use

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,830
what tools do I use do I build a rails

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,920
app do I build a gem many times I would

00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:44,020
actually reach for rails new building a

00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,570
new rails app that's my first instinct

00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:50,710
since that was what I was most familiar

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,809
with but cat would suggest many times

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:56,380
for these back-end technical challenges

00:19:52,809 --> 00:20:00,700
that an entire app is overkill you know

00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:04,450
sometimes the building a gem or even a

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,520
script would suffice and you know that

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,670
would leave me more time for focusing on

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:12,070
like optimizations Reba robust testing

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:17,190
and like fleshing out any algorithms

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:21,280
that I wrote so even more importantly

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:24,090
cat would teach me foe paws to avoid for

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,470
example as someone who is self-taught

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:29,470
sometimes I will already be familiar

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:31,600
with a technical concept but I won't

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:35,080
know the official term that it's called

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,200
or other times I'll have like read a

00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,270
particular buzz word but I'm not sure

00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,690
how to pronounce it since I've never

00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:47,290
said it out loud before so an example of

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:49,960
this word was idempotent I had a lot of

00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:53,590
trouble you know saying this word out

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:58,150
loud and so cat knows I love emojis and

00:20:53,590 --> 00:21:02,590
I'm very visual learner and so they like

00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:06,660
came up with this like I den potent sand

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:09,780
emojis the soup is kind of like fun so

00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,780
you know

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:18,169
it was it really helped me like remember

00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:22,160
how to say this technical term so I was

00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:23,990
really thankful for that another

00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,510
important part of being a great mentor

00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,940
is architecting with your mentee a plan

00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:33,350
a plan of what they want to accomplish

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:35,330
in the future so this is true even when

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,309
you're meant to you is not even exactly

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:40,309
sure of what they want their future to

00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:43,039
look like so in the beginning of mine

00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:45,289
and cats mentor mentee relationship

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,559
I wasn't even completely sure that I

00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:50,419
wanted to pursue back-end development

00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:53,659
you know I had I was still considering

00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:55,700
pursuing front-end development I had

00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:58,100
done a lot of like exploration on my own

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:02,960
was leaning towards back in but honestly

00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:06,650
I wasn't even sure so in order for me to

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,890
make a well-informed decision Kat told

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,320
me about specific hardships that I would

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,690
have to navigate as a not man when

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,679
pursuing front end versus back end

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:20,780
development so Kat told me that the

00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:24,169
relationship non men have with front-end

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:26,440
development is complicated they

00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:29,030
explained to me how the tech industry

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:33,020
sometimes devalues front-end work

00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:34,730
especially HTML and CSS work and that

00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,580
many times this work is strongly

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:40,159
associated with non men there's this

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,380
biased idea that women are good at

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,530
making things look pretty and that

00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,510
back-end development is too hard so that

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:50,870
we're most likely to be siloed into

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:54,710
front-end I obviously think front-end

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:58,340
development is very complex but that's

00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:02,320
that's the insight Kat told me industry

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:05,299
wise that I should just be aware and so

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,850
this contrasted with the advice that I

00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:11,090
got for back-end development that

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:13,490
there's much fewer non men software

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:16,309
engineers in the backend and that I

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,620
should be prepared at future jobs to be

00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:20,770
the only person who looks the way that I

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,770
do

00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:31,320
so another point that's really important

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:34,340
to be a really effective mentor is that

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,690
mentors should help mentees design

00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:41,640
personalized strategies on how to

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:43,710
approach the job search so Kath worked

00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,290
with me so we could best navigate the

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:50,610
technical interviewing landscape to best

00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:53,010
suit my specific needs so in my case I

00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,960
was super overwhelmed by all of the

00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:57,270
responses I was getting from cold

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,600
applying to a high number of tech

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:02,940
companies each week it was impossible

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,590
for me to complete all of the number of

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,100
technical challenges and interview

00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:11,010
requests that I was getting from them so

00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,920
Kath helped me pivot to a new strategy

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:16,560
where I only applied to companies where

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,260
I could get a referral from untrusted

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,710
underrepresented person in tech I've met

00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:27,000
in real life from Twitter or we all

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:29,220
jeaious or again an ally from that is

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,910
trusted from any of those communities so

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,890
this shift in job searching was also in

00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,310
hopes to try and filter out a lot of

00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:41,690
horrible technical interviewing

00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,690
experiences I was already accustomed to

00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:52,970
so I argue that the most important facet

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,770
of mentorship is sponsorship effective

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:58,190
mentorship cannot happen without

00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,960
sponsorship mentors should use their

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,290
privilege and network to open

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,690
communities for their mentees so I was

00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,030
very lucky and Kat leveraged their

00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:10,910
connections within the package manager

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:14,510
community and introduced me to on Jay

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:17,240
Arco he is the CTO of Ruby together

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:20,920
which is a nonprofit that funds

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:26,510
development work for the Ruby ecosystem

00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:29,390
specifically for rubygems and bundler so

00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:32,360
Andre is lead developer for bundler

00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:36,170
which is the dependency manager gem for

00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:44,030
the Ruby ecosystem so bundler is kind of

00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:47,630
like the Ruby NPM so thankfully NPM and

00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:50,630
bundler are good friends because of this

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:57,410
friendship this friendship opened doors

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:59,750
for my career so my experience is that

00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,410
really together were overwhelmingly

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,890
positive

00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:06,890
I was hired as a software engineer for

00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:10,220
Ruby together to maintain Butler here

00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:12,580
iTriage open github issues I answered

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:17,330
users questions I improved documentation

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:20,380
I translated documentation I added tests

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:23,510
and then I also submitted PRS for bugs

00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,310
so Andre was an invaluable mentor

00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,530
because he would clearly break down

00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:31,520
challenging bundler concepts so I could

00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:33,440
understand them something else that was

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,290
like super interesting and helpful was a

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,810
and J also told me about Ruby history

00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:43,370
before I even started Ruby which is

00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:44,150
super valuable just for a context so at

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,810
Ruby together

00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:50,030
I really dive deep into Ruby I learned

00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:53,360
methods and numerable x' that i never

00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:56,160
would have even have touched or seen if

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,960
I'd only ever written

00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,240
so another really cool thing that I

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,430
learned at Ruby together was I learned

00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:07,740
how to build and release gems to Ruby

00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:11,430
gems so I built a jam called gay of hi

00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:17,070
so gay of Faiza gem that prepends

00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:17,070
colorful queer emojis to your exceptions

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:26,130
[Music]

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:29,560
excuse me technical difficulties okay so

00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:32,440
basically whenever you mess up in the

00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:35,260
rails console for GFI you'll get like

00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,240
really cute emojis to hopefully bring up

00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:41,050
your day

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:44,680
so my work for bundler was very

00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:48,070
impressive to perspective employers you

00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,080
know my full-time job search even after

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:53,290
working a few short months at Ruby

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,750
together was already much more fruitful

00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:57,880
I've no doubt in my mind that my

00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,830
contributions to bundler helped me land

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,950
my current back-end software engineering

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:05,440
position I found out that employers

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,780
really value experience in the package

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,910
manager space and look highly upon

00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:22,000
building and releasing gems so I would

00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:25,150
like to show you how KFI works so

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,430
basically this is a rails out you go to

00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:32,140
your gem file you put jfi in it go back

00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:35,890
to your terminal you bundle install

00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:38,860
which is like NPM install it's all

00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:44,080
installed and then you can open up the

00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:46,660
rails console play around and then yeah

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,730
when you mess up you'll get awesome

00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:52,570
emojis so hopefully you'll make your dip

00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:57,580
agai debugging a little little happier a

00:28:52,570 --> 00:29:00,270
little better so yeah some rainbows some

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:04,030
like kiss and like lipstick emojis

00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:06,600
Sparkle emojis so yeah that was really

00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,600
fun to build

00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:17,320
so in spite of adversity the biases of

00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:20,289
interviewers the super time-consuming

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,080
coding Giles and the feelings of being

00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:26,019
other dand having to prove myself over

00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:29,320
and over again in spite of all of that I

00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:31,749
am here so my career in tech as a

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,230
back-end software engineer has taken off

00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:38,080
now as I gained more and more privilege

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:41,739
in tech and the more senior I become

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,289
I really hope to both mentor and sponsor

00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:47,259
underrepresented folks like myself

00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:49,629
trying to break into tech I want to

00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:52,869
bring underrepresented folks up with me

00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:56,799
as I rise I want to pay it forward so

00:29:52,869 --> 00:30:01,869
that other underrepresented folks become

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:04,840
a part of tech so thank you very much

00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:06,850
for coming to my talk if your company

00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,090
uses Ruby or you're passionate about

00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:12,220
helping fund upper represented folks to

00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:15,070
get paid for open-source work

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:19,509
Ruby together always welcomes company

00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:21,429
and individual donations and also my

00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:23,889
company KITT Chuck is currently hiring

00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:27,039
