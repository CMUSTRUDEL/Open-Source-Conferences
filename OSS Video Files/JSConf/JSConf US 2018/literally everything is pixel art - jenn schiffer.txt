00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:24,050
[Music]

00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:01,239
so thank you for having me comms is my

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:06,460
first time in Carlsbad no one no one

00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:09,880
will tell me why what Carl did I I've

00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:14,380
been really nervous all week so if you

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,760
know I'd like to find out and yeah so

00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,470
thank you for taste and for having me

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,860
thank you to all our problematic

00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:23,979
sponsors for making this event happen I

00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:29,140
am going to do as I usually do which is

00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:31,390
tell a story when when I was a kid I was

00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,390
very good at school except for history

00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,880
class it was my least favorite class I

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,950
was and still am very bad at memorizing

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,680
things that I don't see the point of

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:45,670
remembering like years famous men in

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,490
powder wigs are born and as a response

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:51,010
to my frustrations about the subject my

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,659
father would always tell me those who do

00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,990
not study history are doomed to repeat

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,170
it

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,720
imagine I'm a very thick Brooklyn accent

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,670
and I resented it because it didn't make

00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,850
the class any easier and my grades

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:07,540
improve but since then I have come to

00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:09,069
realize that he or the Spanish

00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,239
philosopher George Santayana who

00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:14,019
actually came up with that quote I

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,120
realize that maybe he was onto something

00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:19,599
there are many things that have happened

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,100
in history that are happening again a

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,960
lot of bad things

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,940
but also good things and we're doing a

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,820
pretty bad job at recognizing that and

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:31,810
adapting accordingly even in our humble

00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:34,180
JavaScript community like have you

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,370
considered that many of our so-called

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,800
innovations in JavaScript actually have

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,770
prior art we didn't invent functional

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,630
programming or command-line interfaces

00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,600
you know for JavaScript frameworks

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,700
that's like the new hot thing now we

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,650
didn't invent codes of conduct at events

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,930
every mall in Jersey in New York at

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,080
least has codes of conduct this is the

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,670
Atlantic terminal in Brooklyn and we

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,510
also did invent baking bread which is a

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,970
huge trend through here this is a really

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,250
great photo 19:17 of a couple of

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:10,420
backbone.js developers taking a break to

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:12,910
check on their their bread these

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,580
particular things have not been actively

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,670
harming society but I think it's slowing

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:21,160
the the industry down it's been like a

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,870
solid five years and a few months since

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,940
I entered this industry from academia

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,820
and most of the public discourse about

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,910
the language is still just shitposting

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,030
which doesn't seem very innovative or

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,850
inventive to me and I fancy myself an

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:42,430
innovator and an inventor I invented the

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:45,990
bike plow and it was at this event in

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:51,070
2014 when I innovated efficient search

00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:53,260
with the jorts sort algorithm four years

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:57,580
later and shortswords been implemented

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:59,670
in 47 different languages which means

00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,880
I'm not the crazy

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:06,280
it wasn't rxjs but then they moved repos

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,350
and I think an envious soul removed it

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,500
so maybe one of you can make a pull

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,300
request and put it back in but over the

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,100
past year or so my my focus has shifted

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:20,170
from jean shorts and efficient sorts to

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,480
ethics and technology especially its

00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,170
relationship with art history get you a

00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,419
woman who can do both

00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:30,050
[Music]

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:32,300
there through my explorations of the

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,789
parallels between ethical quandaries and

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,310
the art world's past and present and the

00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:39,259
tech industry's President future I've

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,780
learned a lot more than I anticipated

00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:45,110
about how my decisions as a software

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,699
engineer and citizen impact the people

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,680
in the communities and I'm a part of

00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:50,780
I think software engineers have a huge

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,310
tendency to forget that we are also

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:57,199
citizens and it turns out that we may

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,590
have already been doomed to repeat

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,750
history and our industry is actively

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,690
ignoring that or trying to rewrite it

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,940
and it's driven me to take a more

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,220
historical approach in my education

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,220
around web development so instead of

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,289
like just learning a cutting-edge API or

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,539
a long existing one that I finally now

00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:20,479
have to use her project I've been

00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:22,070
researching those technologies and I

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,229
found that it's become a requirement for

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,180
me to getting a true sense of what their

00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:28,430
purpose is so I know exactly how to use

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,830
it a lot of people that are introduced

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,660
introduce two new frameworks or api's

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,220
they use it but they're not aware of

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,050
what the best practices are because they

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,820
don't know the history of how that

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,370
framework came to be and through that

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:45,830
history you kind of infer those best

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:48,530
practices but I wasn't invited here to

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,240
talk about how our ignoring history has

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,210
led us to normalize the existence of

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,789
Nazis in person and online or how

00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,430
several the tech companies represented

00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:00,740
here are complicit by you know actively

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,750
allowing hateful organizations like

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,610
Breitbart to sell ugly t-shirts to a

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,729
large subset of our nation that believes

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,560
that most most a few of the people in

00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:12,909
this room don't deserve basic human

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,409
rights like actually existing or by

00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:17,930
helping ice to organize their emails and

00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:19,970
outlook I'm here to talk about the

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:24,680
tiniest unit of programmable color on a

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:29,360
computer-generated image enhance thank

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:32,449
you the pixel I'm being that this is Jas

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,210
cough which stands for JavaScript cough

00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:38,150
I keep being reminded I should define

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,840
that pixel in JavaScript

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:43,790
x coordinate y coordinate and a color

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,050
but this is the amp track and so on

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,360
legally obligated to provide

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:55,550
high-performance JavaScript free

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:58,220
examples so because of the fact that

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,220
anything displayed digitally is made up

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,620
of pixels and that none of us in here

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,380
not even me can truly define what is art

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,570
I want us to move onward together on

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:12,290
this eight-hour filibuster so that horse

00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:14,180
J s is not exposed with the assumption

00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:18,410
that literally everything is pixel art

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,690
and slide transitions my name is Jen

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,630
Schiffer when I'm not shining the

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:26,690
spotlight on my ADHD with my bizarre

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,630
tech intros I make both pixel art and

00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:33,680
digital art tooling specifically around

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:37,190
pixel art that's me

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,010
so pixel art or it's popularly searched

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,320
nickname and sometimes misnomer 8-bit

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,000
art is a style of art that embraces

00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,240
retro graphics especially from

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
videogames going as far back as the 60s

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,570
it's a style that works both on the

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,390
screen and off my Pixar it tends to be

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,860
more analog written on paper and pixel

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,020
art is abstract you don't need to be

00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:00,130
great or good even at drawing photo

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,950
realistic art and because it turns out

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:06,020
you only need a little bit of data in

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,600
this case under a thousand pixels and I

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,070
think like six colors but a little bit

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,960
of data goes a long way towards

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,720
conveying something as complex as human

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,670
emotion and that's why I make art to

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,350
express feelings and because art is

00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,930
abstract enough that it provides me

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,270
means to define what perfection is when

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,600
it comes to expressing those feelings

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,310
and pixel art lowers the barrier to

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,170
artistic expression while invoking

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,180
nostalgia in a fun and positive way

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,340
which is why I love it and it's what

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,620
drives me to work on make 8-bit art calm

00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,690
which is a free in browser pixel art

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,960
editor that thousands of people use

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,990
every day to express themselves in an

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,550
abstract and nostalgic way I'm also the

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,040
director of community engineering at

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:52,560
glich director sounds really fancy I

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,360
feel like the Greta Gerwig of JavaScript

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,950
and this is where I build and run most

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,870
of my work today and try to empower

00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,900
other creative people to love and use

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,610
the web to express themselves with code

00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,470
glitches the friendliest community of

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,690
coders building the apps of their dreams

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:11,100
and helping others to do this to do the

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,630
same glitch is similar to pixel art and

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,370
make a pit art in that I feel like it

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,470
lowers the barrier to expression while

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,750
invoking nostalgia and a fun and

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,850
positive way and then the case of glitch

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,620
the medium is code and the tools are the

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,700
community and the collaborative editor

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:29,160
in the browser I didn't see some glitch

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,230
users in the audience already so shouts

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,600
out and if you haven't tried it out

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,430
yourself I say give it a shot

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,940
we're trying to build something that you

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,520
know leaves people feeling joy which is

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,740
something that I feel we've seen to have

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,100
lost since the days of Geocities early

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:52,170
Neopets and the hit Warner Brothers film

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:54,210
Space Jam so I've been studying art in

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,210
tech in tandem and through that I've

00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:00,240
become a better artist engineer and also

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,700
a better citizen I always say that to be

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,570
a good programmer you need to be using

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,980
code to do social good and not harm

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,880
which lately seems to be easier said

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,220
than done

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,560
I think that a lot of Engineers have

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,170
forgotten that or worse actively ignored

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,240
that but again I'm not here to talk

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,460
about how there are tech companies maybe

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,230
some even represented here who are paid

00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,300
a lot of money to develop unsheathe

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,430
black box algorithms used to sentence

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,170
people to prison or tear families apart

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,030
there are unethical deportation

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:34,100
processes I'm here to talk about pig

00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,100
Florida and JavaScript oh I'm sorry

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,180
so yeah

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,890
pixel art JavaScript yes because that's

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,040
what the schedule says which by the way

00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,930
my page on the Jas comp website Derek

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,880
had added an Easter Egg in all the text

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:51,120
is in the lower case because that's how

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,310
I typically write I've always been very

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,800
interested in pixel art as someone who

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,990
creates it and as I entered the tech

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,610
industry as a proponent of the open web

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:04,149
and the democratization of the

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:06,070
she's around it I gained a passion for

00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:08,649
creating tools to facilitate the

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,600
creation of pixel art particularly with

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:12,370
the JavaScript language so it makes

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,930
sense that I ended up working at glitch

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,310
so I can facilitate the creation of

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:20,649
JavaScript and an artistic life just

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,829
like me pixel art has a background in

00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:26,110
academia I was a professor an

00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:28,480
administrator and academia and then left

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,490
for the tech industry five years ago the

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,820
first time the term pixel art was

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:38,440
published was in the December 1982 issue

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:40,750
of the ACM communications journal which

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,870
ACM is the Association of Computing

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,640
Machinery are there any members in here

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,930
it's a long-running professional

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,630
organization working to advance

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,089
computing as a profession they also

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,880
author the ACM code of ethics and

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:58,510
professional conduct which is a must

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,730
read I wouldn't call the 1982 issue a

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,790
must read pixel art was only mentioned

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:06,970
to describe how they morphed the like

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:10,560
previous white guy president ACM into

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:13,000
the next white guy president of ACM I

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,890
did up on Amazon this is the least

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,990
popular book in the Animorphs series I

00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:23,290
think that's why ACM pivoted to ethics

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:26,140
and professional conduct like like how

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,329
before the painting came the paint

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,519
before the pixel art there was a pixel

00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:32,500
and someone said someone say the Picts

00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,620
was created with the invention of

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:39,970
photography in 1839 or the first CRT

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:42,550
television right here in 1927 or color

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,519
television in the 1950s but they're

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,290
wrong those aren't actually pixels I

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,390
would argue that it was the

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,079
impressionist movement in the mid 1880s

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,790
where we see the first pixels

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,579
pointillism a technique popularized

00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,930
popularized by Georges Seurat it's

00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:01,779
perhaps one of the earliest forms of

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:04,570
analog pixel art if you can forgive the

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:07,480
irregular grid each dot does have a

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:10,199
color an x and y-coordinates on some

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,199
sort of canvas

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:19,850
there's a Persian by the way it would be

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,149
out of character for me to not plug my

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:26,060
old publication Bart Institute where I

00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,440
wrote code and prose inspired by fine

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,720
artists so if you want to learn more

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,520
about Seurat and see a pic sorts been on

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:37,190
some of his work you should check it out

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:41,270
so although people are not sure exactly

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:43,790
when the word was for spoken pixel first

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,089
appeared in print in 1965 by the Jet

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,990
Propulsion Laboratory or JPL

00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:49,700
surprisingly there was a time when we

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,490
were just building tech to destroy

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,529
democracy and human rights back then the

00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,300
JPL was trying to enhance images from

00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:58,550
outer space and conduct research on

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,760
computer imaging so we can have the nice

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,770
displays that we have today and in the

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,480
sixties dozens of computer scientists

00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:08,089
working out of iconic research

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,610
institutions like JPL Xerox PARC Bell

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,290
Labs we're innovating displays and the

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,910
creation of imagery for those displays

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,459
and they were hiring artists to come and

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:20,320
create art with their software imagine

00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:22,670
that allowing artists into the office

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,860
david m was one of those visual artists

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,770
he was not particularly interested in

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,600
innovating as a digital painter he came

00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,220
from traditional paint but it was par

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,200
for the course when hardware and

00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,190
software for making art were so young

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:39,770
and also like broken all the time in an

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:43,580
intro to his book on art cleverly titled

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:46,160
the art of David M he expressed exactly

00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,800
how I feel about my MacBook Pro with the

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,150
touch bar he said I quickly learned that

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,650
making pictures the state of art

00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,690
computers required a lot more than

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,490
simply learning user tools computer

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,079
programs are delicate and fragile as are

00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,209
many of the personalities who created

00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,829
them everything was in a state of

00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:06,079
development and the machines tended to

00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:07,670
break down speaking of display woes back

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,130
then the only way to capture digital

00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,980
displays was to literally photograph the

00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:15,589
screen I can relate as I recently moved

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,180
from using a math book to this Windows

00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:20,500
machine and I still have no idea

00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,500
how to take a screenshot on it

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,700
David Emmel is also one of the several

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,890
artists were able to use super paint

00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,870
which is an 8-bit digital color painting

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,790
system created out of Xerox PARC by

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,370
Richard sharp and its colleagues one of

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,950
whom was the co-creator Pixar I'll be

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,810
Ray Smith if you go to his website it's

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:42,620
currently updated and I think rivals

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:45,440
space jams and this is the the rack that

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,510
the hardware sat on super paint was an

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,399
innovative image and image editing

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:52,370
application that became the foundation

00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:56,260
of future imaging editing editing

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:59,720
software that we even used today and

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,700
this artwork black girls by this artist

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,860
Fritz Fischer who took a job as a night

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,800
guard at Xerox PARC so that he can in

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,790
his off time use the system to draw this

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,920
is one of the earliest and most

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:13,850
impressive digital paintings made on the

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,430
system and in 1983 super paint one Xerox

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:20,990
and Emmy so take that like whatever

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:22,670
actor ever won an Emmy well perhaps a

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,410
charm to most about super paint when I

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,770
learned about it was how its tools were

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,930
drawn using super paint itself this was

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,390
a major validation for me doing the same

00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:35,029
for make 8-bit art calm this is actually

00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:37,670
super paint somebody running on my

00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:39,320
macbook you can get the executable file

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,029
and I used wine bottles so I could run

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:46,520
it on the Mac and it worked

00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:48,500
look at my beautiful try so back in 2011

00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,810
I was interested in learning JavaScript

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:54,709
and leaving academia and so I built make

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:56,240
a bit art comm as a way to learn

00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:58,190
JavaScript and build something I would

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,390
use again I don't know how to explain

00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:05,390
shot unlike super paint which sat on

00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:08,209
like two five-foot equipment racks my

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:13,400
system sat on like a folder on a shared

00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:15,199
hosting site which no an initial launch

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,819
it was a large difficult aenor that held

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,160
many smaller disk wares

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:21,319
where on click it would have its

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,380
background color change to one of those

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,780
several options of the color I gave the

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,510
user and to save your art I told you to

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,830
take a screenshot

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,710
maybe a horrible human what I should

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,970
have done was tell you to photograph it

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,620
to make the user experience easier

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,630
though I learned about the canvas API

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,300
realized I needed to know a little bit

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:45,950
more about JavaScript than just jquery's

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:48,230
click and CSS functions in this this

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:51,500
code and make a pitar is doesn't use

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,360
amps so I'm not gonna do that here you

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,090
have it you have a canvas you grab the

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,180
context depending on the X&Y of where

00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,890
the mouse clicks you just draw a square

00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:05,120
on the grid using clear rector fill

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:07,010
direct I was a PHP developer at the time

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,960
so the save functionality that made

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,780
sense to me was obviously to make an

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,790
AJAX call to a PHP script that created

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,470
the file I'm a shared hosting server of

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,740
the image and returned that images

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,790
location to the user for them to save

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,350
and of course I forgot to write the

00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,440
script that made this files only

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,150
temporary which I realized when I got an

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,340
email from my shared hosting company

00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,650
reporting that like not only was i I

00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,040
disk space but like the entire like rack

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:37,670
was like filled with about 1,200 marques

00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:40,220
and I realized this all could be

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:42,530
remedied and done client-side and so I

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,270
rewrote the whole thing and I even made

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,480
the canvas of the page the full width

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,820
the window and a new color palette

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,030
features copy/paste and I realized that

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,740
the obsolescence of my constraints as a

00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,050
programmer now writing client-side

00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,700
JavaScript I was through that able to

00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,580
remove the constraints of the artists

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,750
using my tools including myself and if

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,450
you're interested in learning about how

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,520
I build the app with non developers in

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,320
mind you should watch my notorious

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,360
thunder planes yes talk your grandpa

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,070
probably doesn't have node

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,250
people just call it my open-source as a

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,810
prison talk as I mentioned earlier

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,530
thousands of people use make a pit art

00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:23,450
calm to draw probably most Mario's other

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,550
than the fact that the site loads fast

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,640
as hell using jQuery and web fonts

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,770
thanks to a lot of contributors there

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,230
was nothing particularly innovative

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:35,150
about what's going on on the site and

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,980
remember I am an innovator and an

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:40,580
inventor so naturally I was driven to

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:43,340
explore an experiment

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:49,820
I got the chance to do that in 2015 do

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:51,980
you hear my fidgets thinner so intensity

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,320
knows offered an unpaid artist residency

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,590
at the Maidan NY Media Center live in

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,269
the life they wanted cool technologists

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,890
to show the entertainment industry that

00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:03,529
innovative things really at a median

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:06,080
image Canon to happen to your city stop

00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:08,059
move in Hollywood where are you going

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,640
and I wanted to explore how to

00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:12,649
conceptualize map it Florida's more of a

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,909
process and path from blank canvas to

00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:16,669
something that invokes some sort of

00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:18,409
emotion without needing to record video

00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,600
or take constant photographs in my

00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:22,909
scream and I wanted to map that

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,100
importance of process to the work of the

00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:26,750
everyday developer as it seems to be

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,549
what artists need to do to legitimize

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,220
their work in the tech industry still

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:34,279
these days at least until JPL starts

00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:39,049
hiring more artists so here is familiar

00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:41,510
with the joy of painting for those

00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:44,210
you're not it features the artist Bob

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,070
Ross who paints mostly landscapes in an

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,799
instructional format aired during the

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,149
80s and 90s and I don't know about you

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,950
all who have watched it but I never

00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:54,590
watched it solely to see the end product

00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,330
I wanted to see Ross's process see how

00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,730
he painted those fresh mountains and

00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,350
happy trees after all the show was

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,590
called the joy of painting not the joy

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,240
of a painting and the importance of

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,039
documenting process is not only

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,870
important in art I mean who among us in

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,399
this room has not cried for joy or

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,659
terror or sadness over version control

00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:16,399
keeping a history of our applications

00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:17,990
code is one of the first things we set

00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:20,210
up before we even print out hello world

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,549
these days and being able to see a

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,149
history of what code is not only it's

00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:27,830
not only useful for reverting to before

00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:30,380
freaking commits but it's crucial for

00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,059
auditing onboarding or simply reading

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,250
the history and understanding why the

00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:36,789
features that exist exist and why they

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:39,799
were written the way that they were

00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:41,389
those who do not study history of a code

00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,250
base are doomed to repeat the same

00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:47,950
mistakes its developers made and past

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,950
sprints I said

00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,929
to me the joy codon is seeing how the

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:56,200
developer got there like being able to

00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:58,659
view source in history so it's not a

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,500
surprise to anyone who knows my work or

00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:04,000
knows glitch able to view the source of

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,960
apps and it's why we brought that

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,640
functionality to server side files and

00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,049
also we ever get realigned interface so

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,650
you can visually slide through the get

00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:16,659
history of your app studying history if

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,789
we have to do it or else be doomed we

00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:20,770
shouldn't feel doomed and cry while

00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:23,820
we're studying it like I did in my AP

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:30,039
government in politics class I did not

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:31,809
by the way so there's been a lot of

00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:34,059
really weird interesting debate over

00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,480
whether to keep you source or get rid of

00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:36,669
it

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,580
as if that's even a real idea it's

00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:43,029
already kind of hidden from view and I

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,820
say it's important for new developers to

00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:48,940
be able to learn to build the web like

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:51,309
we did by seeing working code and not

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,990
learning alone others say that if you

00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:54,970
fight for view source and that means

00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,409
that you hate performing code you don't

00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,049
care about the people who have bad

00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:00,610
internet access which isn't true and I

00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:05,830
think it's a completely unfair argument

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:08,230
my stance on it is that it's it's 2018

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,090
we have we have a robot on Mars that

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:13,330
apparently sings happy birthday to

00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:17,049
itself we have a Tesla orbiting

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:19,090
in space and you can get like a 20%

00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:22,630
discount at Helens pizza in Jersey City

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,610
if you pay with Bitcoin so technology is

00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,210
like advances and it's still

00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:29,200
evolving so instead of both sides

00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,460
dismissing the other's movement we

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,250
should instead figure out a way to

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:36,000
provide a performin information

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,289
superhighway surfing experience without

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,330
obfuscating our coach the point that

00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:43,090
there's no transparency as to what our

00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,220
apps are even doing and this can mean

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,679
that we innovate how we bundle our code

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:51,250
or how we host it or how browsers render

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,960
it or even what languages we build the

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,240
web in which we know is changing with

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,950
web assembly I think that's gonna be

00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,820
really important with the current trend

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:03,340
of developers building trackers

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,990
and using people's CPUs to buy and

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,750
to mine cryptocurrency

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,640
and consumers are becoming more hip to

00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,860
the shitty things that are being done to

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,700
them through the web and I think that if

00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:17,320
we want the open web to win which we do

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,000
we need to throw out those straw man

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,680
arguments and just accept the fact that

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,620
we have a lot of collaborative work to

00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,770
do to promote education accessibility

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,980
and performance not either/or and I

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:32,670
think all of us in this room and Beyond

00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,670
actually do want that

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,800
but I'm not here to talk about Helens

00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,740
pizza located at 183 New York Avenue in

00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,600
Jersey City which if you go to my meetup

00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,360
jersey script on the last Tuesday of

00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,190
every month you can go down the street

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,290
and have a slice that's really a good

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:57,070
I'm here to talk about everyone's

00:24:53,290 --> 00:25:00,790
favorite no no no no I'm here to talk

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:02,440
about process so in 2005 I found this

00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,150
flash-based drawing app called otis

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,370
sketch created by adobe by a design

00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,750
agency called oda pot you may know them

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,510
as the premier digital partner of

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,460
hennessey since 2012

00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,020
oh no sketch was really adorable to

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,000
provide you with small newsprint like

00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,710
canvas to create pastel like drawings

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,360
and the aesthetic was really cute my

00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,870
favorite part was that it let you replay

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,250
the drawing of your anyone else's art so

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,870
in essence it was intentionally and

00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,360
beautifully exposing the process of the

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,250
art created sadly it was a prime example

00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,080
what I've been mentioning in previous

00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,750
talks in line non-consensual

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,730
ephemerality as the app and its

00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:40,030
associated gallery no longer exists

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,410
r.i.p flash this is what happens when

00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,240
you allow your process and final

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:45,580
creation to be locked behind proprietary

00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,990
services and protocols which by the way

00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,270
glitch does not lock you into

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,590
proprietary languages or protocols you

00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,270
can export your apps and run them

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:57,670
anywhere there is no to engineer scoff

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:59,380
exclusive I figured an auto sketch like

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,820
feature that replays the process of

00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,440
drawing Pixar would be really rad for

00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,050
people who draw I make a pit art to come

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,730
and it wouldn't be too hard as I'm was

00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,020
already saving info about each stroke

00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:11,120
and paint for the reduce

00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,640
action allottee so basically whenever

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,070
you drew something I would save what the

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,200
X&Y coordinate and the color was and add

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,590
that to an array so you had an array of

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,240
the entire history but the site is

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,560
making a pin art and not make 8-bit art

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,600
and replay it and it would be out of

00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,310
character for me to build a monolith

00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,590
suite of drawing and replaying tools

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:32,420
instead of having a separate app that

00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,940
replayed the process info from my

00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,280
drawing app and I decided that if I do

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,740
that I can then standardize that process

00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,780
info in a way that it can be used in any

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,310
app that wanted in on the action whether

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:48,220
or not actually built it I want to

00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:52,160
democratize the pixel and the process

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,350
this exploration of process in its place

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,750
in the open web ecosystem led to my

00:26:54,350 --> 00:27:00,890
invention of picks on or Pixlr option

00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:02,930
pixel art object notation and it doesn't

00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,460
have to just be about pixel art it could

00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:07,490
just be anything with pixels much like

00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:09,650
how JSON is used outside of JavaScript

00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,540
despite its name I might not write that

00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:15,980
to her anymore but I always take a

00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:17,600
chance to troll the daddy of JSON so

00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,850
picks on is a proposed standard for the

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,510
representation the pics are using JSON

00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:25,550
and properties of the exit rdf schema it

00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,620
provides means for both lightweight data

00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:29,950
interchange and the object oriented

00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:33,380
creation of digital images especially

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:36,260
for pixel art I use JSON because of how

00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:39,080
universal it is unlike past attempts at

00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,840
anti compression formats like X bitmap

00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:45,200
which were written in C and its sequel X

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,360
pixmap although this is like in the late

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,310
80s when the universe wasn't all that

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,070
big so Universal interchange was a

00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:54,500
different kind of beast actually a

00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,030
thought just crossed my mind that maybe

00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,720
this will make a comeback with

00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,990
webassembly

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,150
you know I love this format by

00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:04,220
the way and it sort of inspired my

00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:06,500
thinking of Brown representing animated

00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,360
pixel art using pics on where you're

00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,690
defining the colors as a variable and

00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,190
then each like string is just like the

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,070
listing of the pixels by that color

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:18,340
which i think is pretty rad but ya pick

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,710
songs just JSON there are two objects

00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,080
Exmouth and Pyxis

00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,419
EXIF is any sort of properties defined

00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,970
by the exchangeable image format rdf

00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:29,649
schema which specifies the formats used

00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,539
by digital devices like cameras and

00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:33,640
scanners to tag digital images if you

00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:35,200
look at the info of your photo it has

00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,630
the info of like what you took the photo

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,730
with and you know when you think about

00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:42,250
the app and software combo that you make

00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,740
to draw pixel art is itself a digital

00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,149
device and for the sake of Korean fits

00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,130
art many of the properties are not

00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:50,590
necessary or even affable applicable

00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:52,990
I've narrowed it down to software

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:55,510
artists image description user comment

00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,240
copyright in daytime but you can like

00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:00,070
add as many things as you want I know it

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,330
J's copy you Ryan doll like one of his

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,669
regrets about node was how much

00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:06,100
configuration is in package JSON I just

00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:09,250
say like figure every thing and

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,770
package shape you can add as much as you

00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:15,120
want to pics on but because it's based

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:19,450
on a schema that's existed since like

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,299
2003 before that pics if is the Pixar

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,340
it's been @exif in essence it's unique

00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,590
to pixel images breaks down the image

00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,570
beyond its typical metadata and focuses

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,490
on the individual strokes and drawings

00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:33,820
of the pixels within the image

00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:35,919
the first property pixels is an array of

00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,960
pixel objects representing the pixels

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,679
drawn in the image so you basically push

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,809
to that array as the pixel is created

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,380
and you see those recognized with X Y

00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:47,980
color coordinates it can or cannot be

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,659
immutable

00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,039
I prefer immutable so that you're

00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:53,200
constantly just pushing pixels so you

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,240
can see the whole process of drying you

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,190
know if you're a spy you can like write

00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:02,730
a message and then erase it all and then

00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:06,429
draw over it I love like spies seem cool

00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:08,110
because it's a new idea in this format

00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,630
the list of properties is fluid and

00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,549
ever-changing at the moment so right now

00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,020
it's just XY in color but it's a pretty

00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:16,419
young standard considering how little

00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,549
work I've been able to put into it since

00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:21,309
I started I can see future Canon

00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:23,649
properties and pics it like frames for

00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:26,590
animated pixel art and it'll probably

00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:30,580
look something quite like X bitmap

00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:33,010
electric boogaloo and pixel objects can

00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,900
also contain stroke IDs like they do and

00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,820
make a bit

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,880
if you view the source I think Potch had

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,740
contributed that years ago I just

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,540
figured that as the community of people

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,720
developing what picks on grows and more

00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,430
properties can be standardized and the

00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,990
whole purpose of proposed in the

00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,820
standard is so that everyone can use it

00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,910
and build great apps on their own to

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,559
collaboratively and and build a

00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,410
community of cool folks excited about

00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:00,809
the open web and how it can be used to

00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,400
continue innovating digital art I'm

00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:03,780
lucky for me that's already been

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,210
happening in the past few years so I

00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,280
wanted to give you a look at some of the

00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,900
things that I've built and other people

00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,750
have built in the past couple years that

00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,300
import and export pick song so pick song

00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,250
loop clip me is the original picks on

00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,620
playground I built during my residency I

00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:24,030
made in NY used to live in August dot

00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,860
today and it's you drew it it has an

00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:28,170
initial picks on file that draws that

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,000
message and you can export it you can

00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,010
import picks on and play around with it

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,830
and it just loops drawing it over and

00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:37,410
over again just want to show off that

00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:39,990
glish apps have a console you can see

00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:45,179
here that a the picks on file for that

00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:47,670
drawing is only 14 kilobits and a PNG

00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:50,010
file would probably be about like 50k

00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:52,140
and a gif of high quality because you

00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,570
want anti compression because pixel art

00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,210
when it's compressed looks like garbage

00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:00,450
the littlest if any compression would be

00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:03,720
much higher so if you have a photograph

00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,910
and you export it to pics on it's going

00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,200
to be a really large JSON file you

00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,510
probably just want to use the photograph

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,820
but if you're concerned about keeping

00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:16,020
the process of creating abstract pixel

00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:18,840
art pics on is much more performant make

00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,970
8-bit art implements the ability to

00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,800
import and export pics on it's not as

00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,390
good as I'd liked it to be but I'm

00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,170
planning to spend my open-source time in

00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:30,780
q4 that's director speak for the fourth

00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,940
quarter of the year to focus on tree

00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,370
factory make a pit art so it doesn't use

00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,870
jQuery I want to be more responsive so

00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,220
it works as a PWA I got to add like a

00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,020
manifest and all that fun stuff

00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,610
and I want to enhance the pics on

00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,400
experience cross-browser since there

00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:47,399
tends to be issues image two picks on

00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:50,460
glyph me converts her image to pics on I

00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:52,259
made it on the fly because there's this

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,859
kid who is making a video game for his

00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:58,499
final project in college and he had it

00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:00,749
saved but then like his browser crashed

00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:03,599
and localstorage for some reason cleared

00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:05,879
out i implemented or just save your

00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,679
artwork and he was like I need to import

00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:09,749
this image so bad and I don't have that

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:14,070
part of me beep at art so I gave him

00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:16,080
this evening for him to import the pics

00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:19,139
on version of art and he did really want

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,580
less final which is really cool so even

00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:23,249
though that's not really what the point

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,809
it picks on is like it's there you can

00:33:23,249 --> 00:33:27,479
do it people do weird stuff with all

00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:29,460
tech that we do anyway terror against

00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:32,969
Allah made pixel eyes which is inspired

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:36,210
by the previous app and it lets you pick

00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:38,639
flies or pixel ties the image before

00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,529
converting to pics on which i think is

00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:43,049
pretty rad

00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:44,849
Blake Winton made an acorn extension if

00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:47,369
maybe use the acorn image editing app

00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:50,669
that lets you export your images to pics

00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:53,879
on just search acorn pics on and you'll

00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:56,879
find the gist come up Matthew Hudson

00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:58,469
made an NPM module I haven't had a

00:33:56,879 --> 00:34:00,149
chance to use yet it's fairly new he

00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:02,700
emailed me he said pick songs available

00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:04,499
can I like name my module that I was

00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,089
like I'm not your mom you can name it

00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:07,739
that but I don't think it's like the

00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:13,740
right name for it but he Lee did it

00:34:07,739 --> 00:34:16,409
anyway take me to church and then this

00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:18,629
guy Annie made an SVG picks on renderer

00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:22,440
which is really rad so it just takes

00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:24,929
picks on and then converts it to SVG so

00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,849
there are people who have made art make

00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,220
8-bit art and they're like I want to

00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:31,139
convert this to SVG and I'm like export

00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,359
the pics on run it through this renderer

00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:36,000
and you've got your SVG so I don't have

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,859
to build that monolith image editing app

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,490
I can have the set of like apps that I

00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:43,409
list in the app for people to use and I

00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:45,510
think you can just search SVG picks on

00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:47,990
renderer on code pen and have it going

00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:52,409
there and basically it just creates the

00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:55,770
SVG element and just adds a little

00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:57,720
pixels to it so yeah the future of pixel

00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,170
is unknown it needs work I plan to

00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,660
improve its usage

00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,849
art and build more apps on glitch that

00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,559
you all can remix and create the apps of

00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:07,119
your dreams with and if you're

00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:10,210
interested in getting involved the spec

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,059
can be read at Gen money dot biz slash

00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:15,549
pics on of course I should probably get

00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:17,170
its own official site who knows if you

00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:18,760
want us to watch more of me talking

00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,680
about pics on pixel art of computer

00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,630
graphics in general I mean such a

00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,039
prototype of pixel art process for

00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:27,220
animation in my thgs

00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:32,670
talk about the array prototype before I

00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,670
had my residency it had rave reviews

00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,920
much like he also loved my jorts art

00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:40,539
talk I also then spoke at James comp

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,339
Columbia after my residency where I

00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:44,109
launched pics on shortly after I

00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:47,289
released the first draft yeah shout outs

00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:49,299
in Columbia dev that's one of the best

00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:51,130
conferences ever and I sort of

00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:52,930
deconstructed the pixel and talked about

00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:54,640
the things that I was working on back

00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,619
then I was the only one that had been

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,569
doing anything that picks on and as you

00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:00,220
can see in the past couple of years more

00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:03,369
people have the communities growing

00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:05,529
which is great I talked about some

00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:07,390
computer graphics theory on specifically

00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:09,880
how to use bresenhem's line algorithms

00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:14,259
to draw lines and pixel grids at code

00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:18,369
genius and some year yeah that that

00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:20,140
crowd they think I look like Golding but

00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:21,730
yeah that was that was a fun that's one

00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,269
of my favorite talks

00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:27,789
despite the comments so yeah yeah in

00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:29,769
2014 I authored an algorithm ingest and

00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:32,589
shortly after I authored the original

00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:35,230
spec for picks on not not ingests this

00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:37,089
isn't a joke and I think that anyone can

00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,619
and should do that kind of stuff and the

00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:40,269
great thing about tech is that much of

00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:42,579
its history has been documented and we

00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:44,079
could take that and run with it and then

00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:46,630
our own technologies and help people

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,980
make great things and just like how

00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,660
there's always a new framework in our

00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,670
ecosystem that makes development easier

00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,829
for us the evolution of all technology

00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:56,890
needs us to have room to explore an

00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:58,779
invent you know like remember how like

00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:01,359
those prestigious research institutions

00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:03,309
like JPL and Xerox PARC and Bell Labs

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,230
they needed help from artists and

00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:07,960
computer scientists who had a passion

00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,670
for art and they needed them to drive

00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,530
innovation so we can see pixels on a

00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,660
screen today and I feel

00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,950
like I could already feel see it

00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,810
happening already that history is

00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:19,240
repeating itself and we're gonna need

00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:21,190
artists and web developers and computer

00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:25,990
scientists interested in art to drive

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:28,720
how future pixels are shown and I think

00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:30,730
it's imperative that more women need to

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,670
be given a space and credit for that

00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:36,670
exploration so I dedicate this talk to

00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:39,880
Joe Miller who in 1969 in Bell Labs

00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:42,720
pioneered paint software by creating the

00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,820
first frame buffer that was three bit

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,680
you can't really find much info on Joan

00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,970
and when they talk about the frame

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,420
buffer they're like yeah it's the first

00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:55,390
but it was pretty slow it was 1969 like

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,980
everything was slow so yeah not

00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,780
surprisingly homegirl doesn't have a

00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:03,040
Wikipedia page and hopefully that will

00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:05,470
change anyway I hope you all enjoy the

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,680
rest of this incredible conference I

00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:11,740
think I earned this if you have

00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:15,790
questions about pics on or glitch please

00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:17,800
do email me or come up to me throughout

00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,150
the day I really want to talk to y'all

00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,190
and see what kind of cool stuff that

00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,340
you're making and yeah thank you very

00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,340
much

00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,000
