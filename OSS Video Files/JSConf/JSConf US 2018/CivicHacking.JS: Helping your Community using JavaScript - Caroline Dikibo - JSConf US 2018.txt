okay I'll how are you guys doing today

00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:43,200
y'all I'm really glad to be here

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,750
so this talk is about civic hacking j/s

00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:53,350
pretty much helping your compute

00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,960
community with JavaScript or how as

00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,149
exposed and eventually use javascript

00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,180
and learned a lot of things about

00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:06,490
different frameworks doing Saavik civic

00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:10,390
hacking throughout texas but first how

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:12,610
am I really what do you know about me so

00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,490
I graduated from Notre Dame with a

00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,650
degree in environmental science and from

00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,799
there I was an environmental scientist

00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,930
and oil and gas got laid off and I've

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,340
had to come to like Jesus moment and I

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:29,040
was like what am I good at

00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:31,900
and I was like coding and fencing so I

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,990
actually end up becoming a fencing coach

00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,520
at a new brand new club and I saw was

00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,650
there in-house developer and I

00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,080
freelanced for three years while trying

00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:44,530
to find my full-time gig in back in

00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,720
Houston along the way every six months I

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,659
would do something very drastic to try

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,299
to get a tech job and one of the things

00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:56,020
I ended up doing was like becoming a

00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:58,450
tech organizer a little bit but another

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,750
thing I did before I decide speaking was

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:06,159
a thing was actually got involved in

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,500
civic hacking so but now I'm an

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,010
associate scientist and training at

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,129
crimson Vista doing cybersecurity so in

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:19,870
Baltimore so I just started back in like

00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:23,000
April so it's really brand-new thank you

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:26,430
[Applause]

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,090
so what is civic hacking really this is

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:33,829
a definition that open gov dated IO

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,689
gives but really civic hacking is just

00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:39,150
about people they're fed up about how

00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:42,659
slow government is moving but look

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:46,129
Kapiti has needs today and just a group

00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:48,599
of people are just very very angry at

00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:50,489
government slow processes and they're

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:55,290
just like let's get done today

00:02:50,489 --> 00:03:02,609
instead of like for like nope like

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:04,790
February 2002 but who are Civic hackers

00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:07,079
other than these people being angry

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,120
Civic hackers can be anyone in the

00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,919
community actually can be you it could

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,439
be you and the man in the mirror but you

00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,769
know that is a Michael Jackson joke and

00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:20,659
I'm kind of off topic because this is

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:25,159
supposed to be a prince - a prince talk

00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:29,819
but pretty much any one day has like any

00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:34,319
needs and any technical skill can join

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,250
it's inclusive but really what did I get

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,669
involved in this

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,579
I like there's me in the mayor and my

00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:45,810
prince pajamas somehow that happened but

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:48,540
like really I'm a nice person and I like

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,609
doing good things so that was like

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,500
number one nostril checklist but really

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,989
the big problem was I had hackathon

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,530
burnout so pretty much I was doing all

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,120
these hackathons and building apps that

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,549
would never see the light of day after

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,400
that like weekend it would just end up

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:09,520
going into the graveyard of github where

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,480
you know all the other to do apps

00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,040
[Music]

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,910
but I actually was thinking to myself

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,070
instead of building like a fun app that

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,440
will never see the light of day what if

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,300
I had spent that at time building an app

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,180
that would actually help somebody and

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,389
like make a difference in somebody's

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:36,639
life so I wanted my work to be a little

00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:39,100
bit more meaningful so open data is

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,800
great I don't know about you but how

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:45,850
many of you guys have like done web

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:50,050
scraping for fun I saw hands go up and

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,270
and down at one point I like but I don't

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,979
know like web scraping like a government

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,430
web site is kind of different because

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,780
I'm opposed to be like a wet hacker and

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:07,180
I don't want to find out the hard way

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:09,760
that orange isn't my color so open data

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,600
is great and all but what if we actually

00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,099
built apps to be open source I know

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,660
there's a lot of frameworks that are

00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:20,050
open source that gives us tools but

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:23,229
already the big problem is cities across

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,060
the nation that have similar problems it

00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:26,590
would be great instead of like starting

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,360
out from scratch you can just go to

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,240
somebody else's repo and see what they

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,919
did and they would be like hey take our

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:38,500
work and like improve it to your own

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:41,080
circumstances right another thing is

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,740
what I found out is civic hacking

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,680
communities are diverse naturally so

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,270
pretty much back in Houston the scene

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,620
over there pretty much as the

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:56,590
demographics of Houston so but in other

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,530
communities like Austin you have other

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,510
like there was an asterisks to this

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,520
because like in Austin there's problems

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:09,280
there there's jeremy gerrymandering

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,960
and also you know other things that have

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,570
been going on to push out certain

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,820
demographics and you see that when you

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,860
actually go to those meetings because

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,720
like no one is going to drive 50 miles

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:26,160
just to do civic hacking

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:30,160
except me but that's another thing so I

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,430
end up going to the I drove down to

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,970
Austin with a friend so and I went down

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:39,850
to do a hackathon yet again I couldn't

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:42,100
escape them and did the hack for Change

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:46,210
and pretty much why I found there was a

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:55,540
project to using reacts so budget party

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:57,040
was that was a app built on reactor to

00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,350
help people understand the budget and

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,990
get voters excited about what's going on

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,970
with the budget and why should we and

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:07,900
why should we like be concerned and

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:10,570
actually look at it so I was really

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,570
excited to get in there so another thing

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:16,810
about civic hacking is JavaScript has

00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:19,210
like a wide pithre ax of different

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,210
frameworks and tools and you could just

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:25,419
decide to use anything you want and no

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,650
one's gonna judge you for it so and you

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:28,360
get to play with different tools that

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,890
you haven't get to play with or play

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,710
with tools that you would play with at

00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,210
work but you're afraid to like mess

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,860
around with them at work because they're

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:40,060
gonna shut everything down and make

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:42,490
everything implode and get fired so I

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,040
ended up learning about react at the

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:48,010
time cuz I wasn't I wasn't I wasn't

00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,100
angular one person at the time so I just

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:55,200
wanted to like learn about react and I

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:57,790
was able to because due to membership so

00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,580
one of the things that our community

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:04,360
sometimes stumbles on is mentorship

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,520
outside jobs because like I know our

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,470
industry really wants people there like

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,530
senior roles but like they came from

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:14,050
somewhere people don't sprout out and

00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:16,060
become like senior developers what eight

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:21,490
years experience wouldn't react out of

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:25,690
nowhere I liked how like the dev opening

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,669
said you know but what I really liked

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,400
about this was someone took the time out

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:34,210
to help me understand react

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,279
and it became like a cycle so when I

00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,589
ended up going back home I was teaching

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,599
my other friends react and other

00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:43,680
framework so it was just like a good

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,120
like circle of life kind of thing

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,050
another thing I found out at this RIT

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:55,540
hackathon was developers really do not

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:58,470
like WordPress so at the time what was

00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:01,060
going on was there was this one project

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,740
that was using WordPress and there were

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,529
all designers and they wanted a feature

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,480
built and there was out of like 100

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:10,630
developers no one would come and help

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,410
them and I felt sad for them and being a

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:16,450
nice person I went to help them and when

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,670
I figured out was they had no

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,790
documentation on what the person before

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,980
did so I wasn't really able to help them

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,130
but I rendered I figured out how

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,860
important documentation was that day but

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:35,380
at this point I realized I was missing

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:37,000
my keys my friend had my keys and I was

00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,680
freaking out because I didn't want to

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,600
walk all the way back from Houston to

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,370
Austin like from Austin you know Seattle

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,620
and Portland is the same distance

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,720
between Austin and Houston's for some of

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,380
you guys still don't realize how big you

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,660
mean Texas is in general so I went over

00:09:53,380 --> 00:10:00,880
to his room and figure out why hasn't he

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:03,040
given back my keys so I found out that

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,650
his team was having a breakdown

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,970
they were pretty much siloed off into

00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,490
their roles and weren't communicating

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,380
with each other it was pretty late on to

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,230
like the hackathon it was like pretty

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,270
much like 6 p.m. at the first day and

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,990
for hackathon terms if you don't have

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:22,209
anything by then that's pretty bad sign

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,550
so I decided to help them out

00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:28,720
I earned up building something for them

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:31,270
like I end up like do only a little like

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,339
site map for them and just a little

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,180
sketch to know that what they can plan

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:37,000
on

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:42,670
and I wasn't really planning on doing

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,770
this but I I didn't really plan on doing

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:49,420
this but like they just needed direction

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:52,450
and to get something done but I wasn't

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,459
really expecting like what my work was

00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:59,080
like have a name and actually have a

00:10:54,459 --> 00:11:01,839
role define to it so but because like at

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,270
that time I was just a freelancer mining

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,660
my own business just getting websites

00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:09,910
built but I didn't know that there was a

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,190
whole section of our industry actually

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,440
made for people to tell these people

00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,770
what to do so it was really important to

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,890
like think about your co-workers that

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:27,250
you have back home that their work is as

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:29,589
significant as well so and civic hacking

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,330
is pretty much about seeing a need and

00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:38,190
then filling that need no matter what

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:38,190
your role is at work pretty much so I

00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:43,630
went back to my little react group for

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:50,170
budget party and I don't know about you

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:52,930
guys but bugs are like cockroaches like

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:57,220
I don't know if you seen the cockroaches

00:11:52,930 --> 00:12:00,220
back in Texas but they fly and it's

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,300
pretty similar to like at work like and

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,760
when you see one of these roaches

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,400
somebody is screaming it's usually a

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,140
manager and they don't screw able to

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,320
stop screaming until like the bug is

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,540
fixed and squash so like I took my

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,680
experience with like fixing like

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:21,220
squashing cockroaches to fixing bugs and

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,440
react and I actually ended up building a

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,959
little bit more confidence like instead

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,450
of being afraid of roaches and bugs I

00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:30,700
was like hey I can actually do this and

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,490
it just built up my confidence which

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:38,770
each one that I smushed it smashed along

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:40,959
so unfortunately I was the only person

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,329
in my group that was based in Houston so

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,110
how did it go back home but I continued

00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:50,170
being part of their program

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,170
and helped out so but it was lonely so

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,730
we actually had successfully that app

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,250
end up going on to win the Mozilla

00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,529
Internet health prize and one of my

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:06,170
friends from the group going to England

00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:09,110
so I came back to Houston and then we

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,959
had our own City hackathon pretty much a

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,420
day before the hackathon we found that

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:17,209
Houston had a pot of money just for

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:20,779
housing that wasn't going to use it

00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:22,820
wasn't being used and pretty much that

00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:26,350
there was this rebranding of section 8

00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,240
housing being called housing choice and

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:32,899
pretty much we came up with a plan like

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,290
about 16 to 20 of us actually came out

00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,880
with a plan for homelessness in the

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:42,350
vacant housing problem because of the

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:44,089
oil and gas like slump and we try to

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,660
figure it out we can build an app for

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,660
this and

00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:59,690
and we did we used HTML and CSS and of

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,610
course JavaScript you know JavaScript at

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:06,200
us hugs you know the parent you know

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:09,560
whatever but because that's pretty much

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,360
what everyone knew we didn't know there

00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,010
wasn't a collective of people knowing

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,950
just one framework and we didn't want

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:21,530
anyone to be left behind so we kept it

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:23,870
vanilla we ended up building this super

00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:27,170
like elevation of an app trying to do

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:30,770
several things and we didn't win the

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:33,230
hackathon but the mayor called a society

00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,570
it's like hey you're doing something

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,310
about this keep on doing this I give you

00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,950
permission to bug people they're

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,750
actually going to use this app so we

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,850
rented up back to the drawing board and

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,320
we actually wanted to like go ahead and

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,940
interview these people so we could

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:52,580
actually build an app that would suit

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:55,400
their needs so we had a new plan in

00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:59,060
place our group considerably shrink down

00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,890
to five people and I was like I have a

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,080
game plan I'm gonna build this out and

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,480
react as I learned it and then I'm gonna

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,220
use WordPress API to actually bring in

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,320
the data from the old databases of

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,530
government and then I'm gonna use meteor

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,930
AGS in the background and I moved on

00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,570
right thinking this is going to be done

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:22,510
it's gonna be great but then this this

00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:26,870
happened I found out very quickly like

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:28,610
nine out of ten times government

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:32,000
officials will not meet with you they

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:34,040
are very very busy people in this hands

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,050
it was caseworkers they were overloaded

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,620
and kind of had to bribe them what lunch

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:45,310
Shh but to make them actually show up

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,260
but they did once or twice but it wasn't

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,990
enough to actually flesh out this app

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:54,820
because we wanted this to be an app for

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:59,110
them and we found out like Houston is

00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:02,500
big y'all we end up driving like 30 to

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:05,050
40 miles into town each time and that

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,959
actually is a substantial gas bill after

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:09,630
you do it a couple of times so we

00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:11,800
decided we're going to find a way to

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,810
sponsor ourselves and we're like let's

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,690
do grant money but that also is a long

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,980
process that first you had to find the

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,350
right grant for you

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,720
and then you have to wait until they

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,540
decide and read all the proposals and

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,610
then you might not even get it but this

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,040
was fine

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:33,550
we thought we could wait but it got to

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,070
the point that we just if you don't have

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,140
like we had all the energy but if the

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,880
world doesn't want to work for your

00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:44,200
change right now there's nothing you can

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:46,510
do to push it along so and we found out

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,690
housing like insurance is a very thick

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:52,899
hard thing to improve but this was fun

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:56,020
because this happened so this is my

00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:59,620
neighborhood so pretty much you had the

00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:03,610
palace in picture so what had happened

00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:07,240
was Palestine was like the original

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:10,709
flooding from Harvey and then you have

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,089
the armed guard over there saying hey

00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,439
you have to evacuate because we're going

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:20,020
to release the dam and then they

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:26,860
released a dam up on top so so all this

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:30,580
took over a week period so but I was

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:34,510
already in the slack group for our civic

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,400
hacking groups get City so we all

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,800
congregated there and then people from

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,020
outside of Houston also integrated in

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:45,400
there giving us like slack had to give

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,809
us free tier at the time and pretty much

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,840
we are in a building out like around

00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:50,690
like 2030 good apps like the big one

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,870
being Harvey

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:55,730
and then we had like other ones for SMS

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,430
attacks using Twitter and Twitter gave

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:02,270
us free tier thank God

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:04,970
also muck rack and just a lot of like

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:08,480
Maps and shelter and just telling people

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:11,180
like where to go to get goods and needs

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:18,050
they might not hence the title Harvey

00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:19,820
needs and I know that we don't really

00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:22,220
think about this much but like a little

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,020
speck machines matter so when we're

00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,480
working in these groups like some of

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,390
these people are working from like their

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,270
teams at work and they have like various

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,580
ways they build things like things that

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:38,780
actually you have to go and use things

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:41,270
that you have to use sources like

00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,910
applications that actually use like 16

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,620
Giga RAM to get in so all you get to you

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,600
get to the point that you start up and

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,160
you're only able to clone the repo and

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,290
then you're not able to do anything else

00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,450
and then you're not actually able to

00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:56,150
like go to localhost which is really not

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,070
exciting so it's really heartbreaking as

00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:01,010
a developer for someone to tell you that

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:04,580
your machine is a parity a barrier to

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:06,890
entry but what's really heartbreaking is

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:10,820
that you end up building like a desktop

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:13,820
app and no one can use this desktop app

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:16,280
because your users don't have desktops

00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,650
they only have phones and no one can go

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,930
to the library because your library is

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:29,860
flooded so no one can use your desktop

00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:32,920
app so I know so setting up development

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,960
environments can be a lengthy process

00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,780
like we have so many like spin-ups

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:43,040
and CIS so this helped us like develop

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:44,780
quicker oh I don't know do people

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,380
actually like playing with wet pack and

00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:50,210
starting things up I'm like cuz that

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:54,230
could take that could take a couple of

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:56,660
hours honestly so we end up things using

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,880
things like CRA CMS is like WordPress

00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,710
even though people don't like WordPress

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,760
they saw like they needed to get things

00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:06,050
up quickly so they they used it

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,420
another thing we found out really easily

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,550
it was pair programming was very useful

00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:14,620
especially when you lost your laptop in

00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:18,800
the flood and you still wanted to code

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:20,210
so you know so you got to like hang out

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,080
with your friend and use their laptop

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:29,390
and also still be able to contribute

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:32,150
right but then also coding blind is very

00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:36,110
hard especially when you're trying to

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:40,070
like some people are just like putting

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:42,320
in HTML tags and like turn in and over

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,700
slack and just like they're not part of

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,980
the you can't stand up their own

00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,400
development repo so they're trying to

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:51,320
contribute but you can't really see what

00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,850
like as front-end people you can't

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,800
really see what's going on and you just

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,900
have to like hope that your code makes

00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,190
it look right and have the faith that

00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,870
somebody else will correct your mistakes

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,480
and talking about mistakes it's okay to

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,980
fail in this circumstances because

00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,429
you're not getting paid for the work

00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,230
you're doing so and your job is not on

00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:14,480
the line it's just millions of others

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:20,929
but like they weren't gonna get anything

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:24,860
done in the first place so so it's like

00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:26,420
it's a safe place to fail so no one's

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,570
gonna blame you they're gonna be like

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:31,880
damn I really wish during this hurricane

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:35,059
this developer got this thing right I'm

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:40,550
like no it's more like hey I hate you

00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:45,020
mother nature my home is gone but it

00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:46,910
wasn't just only coding so we pretty

00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:49,400
much had a environmental crisis our

00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,950
hands so like my background and the

00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,929
viral science helped out especially when

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,460
it came to like water quality and then

00:21:53,929 --> 00:22:01,309
finding out that everything was

00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:02,900
contaminated so but then again hurricane

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:04,940
armor happened and we really weren't

00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,840
expecting that to happen like really

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,490
like for like oh this is almost gone we

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,340
can go back to normal but then this

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,860
happened and pretty much we ended up

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,090
going to a different flat group and in

00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,830
that slack group

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:22,130
it was pretty much the armored response

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:24,230
group so pretty much the people from

00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,210
Houston we migrated over to that slack

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,940
group and we were like hey here's all

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:34,100
the apps we built all you need to do is

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:37,190
change the branding and like the URL and

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:39,140
here you go right so we helped with

00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:42,560
homelink we didn't build the same thing

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,420
twice but there were some innovations

00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,190
that happened on like from they learned

00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,070
from our mistakes they had the chat box

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:51,110
so pretty much a tat box was an easy way

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:54,320
for people that were fleeing their homes

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:57,080
to like actually use their phones and

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,120
get in touch with simple messages to

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:03,860
like guide them on the right path

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,420
so however unlike the team back in

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,660
Houston that all knew each other

00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,910
the Florida team was people that really

00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,770
didn't hang out together so they didn't

00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,360
really know each other and they were all

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:18,260
in different cities and they didn't have

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,240
like one big central like big city that

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,650
all of them met each other so they

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,710
didn't really know each other and it was

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:26,570
just like a circle of like trust not

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:31,910
being there so let's do a little trust

00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:33,830
exercise so how many people can trust a

00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:39,560
person that's sitting next to them their

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:43,060
code raise your hand I saw hands go up

00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:49,040
and down what is this it's like wavering

00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:51,770
make a choice okay now all the people

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,820
that still have their hands up put your

00:23:51,770 --> 00:24:03,710
hands down if the person that is next to

00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:05,630
you as a co-worker put your hand down if

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,230
the person next to you is the Twitter

00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,230
celebrity

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,170
okay so it was only like like this group

00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:18,570
over here like what's your story ah so

00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:21,270
they had a community where they actually

00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:24,270
learned from each other similar to civic

00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:26,880
hacking and thus why they trust each

00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:30,630
other despite working long hours at work

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,610
or seeing Twitter feeds of different

00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:38,370
code geniuses things they've done in the

00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:40,290
past so and also there was different

00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,000
sources of data but you know people

00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,000
couldn't really trust that source of

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,500
data because it ain't trust that person

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
causing like a cachet of like an

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:52,050
infinite loop they couldn't get out of

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,720
of data trust so but then Hurricane

00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:57,510
Maria happened and that was different

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,970
because assembly using a slack group we

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,610
are and abusing whatsapp and what

00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:05,370
whatsapp you know there's a limit of how

00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:08,850
many people can be on that group so we

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,980
actually end up losing people and we

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:12,710
didn't run we're in contact with some

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,510
people and we didn't hear from them

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:18,440
during and some of them we didn't hear

00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:21,030
from them after so it was a scary time

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,850
we were prepared to do the same things

00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:25,559
but it was a little bit different from

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,900
like some of my group of friends we

00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:31,860
ended up doing a create negative that

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:34,140
and we actually thought it was a great

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,350
idea because people would actually use

00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:41,450
their phones first and it just didn't

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:46,530
work out because like FEMA was like no

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:48,420
like no not on my watch and I just had

00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,730
to find out there's some things that the

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:56,100
government should actually pay attention

00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:57,660
to and actually just they should be in

00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,630
charge of that and they should do that

00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,950
but it shouldn't always solved they

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,570
shouldn't always fall down to

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:08,460
individuals because there's only so much

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:11,370
we can do but the good thing is through

00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,559
this getting to know people in person

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,870
and joining an open like source

00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,669
community the civic hacking is pretty

00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:20,460
much the most open source that you can

00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:21,810
but on the fly I was able to get back to

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,200
open source and

00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:29,850
the rat community and also participate

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:32,400
in a friendly what is it called a

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:35,040
holiday party where the reacting that

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,980
pitcher is react versus angular and I

00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:43,230
was on the react team and we gently like

00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:45,120
one against angular by one point so but

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,480
it brings me back so like meaningful

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,580
work I'm like I don't know about you but

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,020
there's like different apps like

00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,050
everyone's working on different things

00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:57,300
at it like work but like some things are

00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:59,720
more crucial than others and then some

00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:05,130
people are just working on is hot dogs

00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:07,770
so but there's a way like if you're

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:10,680
working on is hot dog that is fine you

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:13,290
have to make your money somehow but you

00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,840
can just if you want to get involved you

00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:17,790
can get involved like doing things small

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,080
and local you don't have to go far you

00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:23,520
don't have to drive around a whole state

00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,740
plan a you can just join your local

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,830
brigade like every city has a brigade

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,960
the brigades I went to were open Austin

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,320
and the my local brigade would sketch

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,440
city and you can find your brigade right

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,470
here like there's a website for that so

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,260
if you want to get involved but if if

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:45,420
you don't have time or if there isn't a

00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,240
brigade you can start your own honestly

00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:51,510
but there's always Plan B you can

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,280
convince your workplace and usually if

00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,620
you're like working in a good place your

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,540
workplace will be like yeah we'll go for

00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,550
it but if you're working for a like a

00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,710
more you know where you work for though

00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:03,750
really like I don't have to like tell

00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,460
you like to put yourself out there if

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,190
it's a place that you know they're not

00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,860
going to go for this but you know that's

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:15,840
my little shady thing you know if you

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:19,380
work for evil calm so pretty much this

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,720
has been a tale of pretty much my

00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,810
hacking experience Pacific was safe

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,700
akaky in 2017 I'm glad you guys stayed

00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,190
frigid journey and these are things I

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,270
learned the hard way not the easy way so

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:35,330
and this is it thank you guys

00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,330
