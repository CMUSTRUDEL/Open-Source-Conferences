00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,719
jus thank you for having us welcome to

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:45,300
the last talk of Jay s comp us very

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:48,070
exciting one of two things has happened

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,460
either we've saved the best for last or

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,050
they've pushed all the crap to the end

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,450
we're not really sure which but I think

00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,430
we're about to find out but let's be

00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,050
honest yeah I don't want to do this you

00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,489
don't want to know this do ya let's not

00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,710
do this we'll just go straight to the

00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:06,630
party you don't want to do this come on

00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:09,729
just get in the hot tub yeah who cares

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,530
yes so welcome to datura what is this

00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:15,760
car discovering the true identity of

00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:18,400
horse Jay s using machine learning I'm

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,229
Burke and this is Jasmine Jasmine we're

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,270
gonna pass this shirt and forth here

00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:27,850
yeah so we we work at Microsoft we work

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,500
on the azure team and one of the things

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,000
actually you know before we start you

00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,210
want to just tell about a little bit

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,840
thing a little bit about yourself Burke

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,330
specifically your shirt

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,369
oh sure so I have a show called five

00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,159
things that we do anybody here seen the

00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:43,689
show five things a couple right so a

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,729
couple of I think I work with most of

00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:48,220
these folks thank you for being here we

00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:50,320
have literally dozens of viewers it's

00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,240
the hottest show on YouTube we have at

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,350
least two comments across 17 videos so

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,140
yeah that's me I'm from Nashville

00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,299
Tennessee so on behalf of all the web

00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,590
developers in Nashville thank you for

00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:07,960
having me yeah yeah and as I mentioned

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,750
before I'm I'm from New York

00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,549
I'm from New York but I lived in Florida

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,099
so I was really excited to come hang out

00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:18,129
at James calm 2015 when that happened

00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,730
and I just recently learned that I'm

00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,739
emceeing

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,280
and purchase so this was like we held in

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:25,360
New York City so I'm excited yeah so we

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,420
like I said mentioned before we're gonna

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,239
add your team at Microsoft and one of

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,160
the things that our team does for

00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,860
training is we have these these boot

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,739
camps a lot of us have backgrounds that

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,830
are not in Azure or sometimes not even

00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:44,590
in with cloud technology so it's just a

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,510
great time for us to get to learn about

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,480
the platform learn about the cloud and

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:52,060
also a chance for us our team to get to

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,470
meet each other in real life because we

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,239
are a globally distributed and remote

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:59,230
team so we don't get to see each other

00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,480
in person at all are often so this is

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,680
pretty much where the story starts right

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,239
Burke yeah absolutely

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,069
so Jasmine makes a gift when we're

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,290
actually not on the same team or in the

00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:12,670
in the same organization but Microsoft

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:14,739
is sort of a large company so when we

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,140
say organization we mean like a small

00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:21,040
country and so we work on different

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:23,920
teams inside of the same organization we

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,069
were at this boot camp and this idea

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,670
like most great ideas was born of pure

00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,510
boredom so we were in this class on

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,910
artificial intelligence and machine

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,850
learning and it was a real deep dive

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,549
into actually building models we'd been

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,690
there for two days this is day two we're

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,190
sitting in the back we're highly

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,750
caffeinated we'd be eating Google

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,459
clusters all day if you don't know what

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,910
that is see me later I'll explain to you

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:51,310
the glory of a Google cluster and and we

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:55,060
stopped paying attention as one does at

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,290
the end of two days of workshop actually

00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,989
I stopped paying attention to about

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,040
10:00 a.m. on day one that's that's a

00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,269
problem I should probably get some

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,859
medicine for that I'm gonna look into

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:06,780
that but we're sitting there talking

00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:10,150
about machine learning and and we said

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,870
what if we could use this great power to

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:17,620
do some real good things like

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:20,320
discovering the true identity of the

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,970
horse j/s twitter account and so we had

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,800
this idea that we could take a bunch of

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,990
data and we could just stick it up in

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,900
the cloud and then like we could just

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,310
say like Alexa who is horse j/s and it

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,300
would just tell us because that's how

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,889
machine learning works

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,400
of coure

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:38,550
everybody knows that and so that's how

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,629
the idea came about but who what is

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,389
force chance for those who don't know

00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:44,580
Jasmine yeah sure you did you want

00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,800
explaining worse chances oh yes you're

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,300
absolutely can obviously we prepared

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,150
we've rehearsed this many times we have

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,219
it down to a science so horse genius is

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,610
a parody account on Twitter and what it

00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:59,479
does is it takes fragments of other

00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,479
people's tweets

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,530
and it and it tweets them out and of

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,330
course there's no context it's taken

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,960
completely out of context and so when

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,610
you see the horse Janice tweet right

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,890
like that's great and a lot of times

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,960
it's almost poetic right you're like oh

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,170
that's exactly how I was feeling right

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,870
now so it's this it's this weird

00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,520
it's this weird sort of effect and it

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,830
actually comes from a viral account

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,020
called horse ebooks if you're familiar

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,820
with that which was started by a fellow

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,380
in Russia who later actually sold that

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,830
Twitter account to someone it got so

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,970
popular and so we really we've been

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,520
following this account both of us have

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,160
but we really enjoy this right I guess I

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,360
get a lot of joy out of what his horse

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,410
Jay is gonna say next

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,440
nobody knows right and so from that was

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:59,520
born the project which we called project

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,000
horse yeah so so naming and anything's

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,350
is hard

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,870
Namie piece is hard right so so we're

00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:10,620
gonna talk a little bit about the the

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:13,080
story of how we we went through the the

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,360
process of with process horse our

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,100
projects our excuse me project horse so

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,890
first thing we did is we gather some

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,570
questions other than just who is horse

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,940
genius we had some additional questions

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,220
to kind of give us some clues as to as

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,190
to who it might be and to get to give us

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,540
a end result and then we from those

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,010
questions we started drawing some

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,170
assumptions some things that we already

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,090
knew about like twitter users and you

00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,910
know the tech Twitterverse are the

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:41,220
JavaScript Twitterverse and the people

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,200
we knew and so from that we had some

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,880
assumptions and then finally we moved on

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,650
to planning trying to figure out what

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,720
technology we should use trying to

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,750
figure out what our what our end goal

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
was and trying to figure out how to even

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,260
get started

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,820
and then then we went we're going to

00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:00,030
talk about how we pretty much built

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,880
built project course and then finally

00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:05,640
we'll talk about the results and we'll

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,480
talk about and and we'll expose to you

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,550
exactly who horse races now I know I've

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,320
heard I've heard that people have been

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,849
saying if they don't say who course Jas

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,259
is

00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:16,939
I'm gonna I'm gonna freak out they

00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:18,139
better not say something like oh we're

00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:20,719
all horseshoe yes

00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:22,580
oh yeah I see you're laughing because

00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:24,830
you said it we know you said it yeah

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,479
exactly and when that I mean that's kind

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,819
of a given right we are hurt we all owe

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,009
hurt yes you know horse jss content is

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,599
you know pretty much it's it's us you

00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:34,399
know and like when you saw that tweet

00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,259
you you you Chuck a little because you

00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,149
can identify with that you know that

00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:40,610
whole I think therefore I am right thing

00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:42,679
right you know but let's but before we

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,819
even get into the results we don't want

00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:45,229
we want to make sure that we don't put

00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:51,459
the cart before the horse

00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:54,349
ah thanks welcome that's free that was

00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,519
so uh so first thing so first we're

00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,379
going to look at the questions that we

00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,899
had so the first question that we

00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:01,909
thought of had is we want to figure out

00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:04,490
was horse Jess more than one person I

00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:07,129
initially I thought the horse Jess might

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,419
have been a bot and so at first I was

00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:10,219
like should we even do this maybe it's

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,639
just about maybe we just move on maybe

00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:15,559
there's nothing here and then we and

00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,769
then you know also again horse jess has

00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:22,879
has had has been has been around since

00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:25,939
2012 I believe and has over 7,000 tweets

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,740
so we were like that's that's a lot of

00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,689
that's a lot of content to keep up with

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,399
it can it can really be just one person

00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,060
so other question we had was what tweets

00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,000
just horse

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,130
Jess react to what makes horse GS want

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,779
to quote your tweet what what what do

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,849
you have to say to make horse Jess other

00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,740
than the word JavaScript right to have

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:45,079
horse jeaious react to your tweet or

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,240
quote your tweet we also wanted to know

00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,709
when horse Jess was the most most active

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,560
because that could be some some clues

00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:54,259
that expose expose who this person might

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,910
be and then also we want to know if

00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:59,899
there are certain accounts that horse

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,209
just like to react to and figure out if

00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:04,610
that if that could kind of give us some

00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,810
clues as to if they're followers or if

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,360
they are actually following horse neighs

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,889
yes and then finally we want to make

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,439
sure we want to check in horses ever

00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:15,399
slipped up and maintaining their

00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:19,490
anonymity because for any grid and crime

00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,380
there are an average of 20 mistakes made

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,910
that point directly to the perpetrator

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,589
so we're hoping that we'd find something

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,760
good in that data set that's actually a

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:26,889
true fact if you're thinking of

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,230
committing a crime just

00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:30,639
no statistically speaking there are 20

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,279
things that you will forget about that

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,290
will point directly to you and you will

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,480
be caught thusly so that's what you're

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,369
hoping for right exactly so from those

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,869
questions then we started to think about

00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:44,259
our assumptions and you want to talk a

00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:45,819
little bit about that sure so we had to

00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:47,679
go into this whole thing with a certain

00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:50,319
amount of assumptions you have to start

00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,660
from somewhere so you know after sort of

00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:54,759
the question phase here we moved into

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,290
forming some solid assumptions off of

00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,689
which we could sort of move forward and

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,249
actually do something here you know what

00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:02,889
we're what we're doing here is is very

00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:05,439
much sort of a forensic analysis which

00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:07,660
is why it gets very interesting so the

00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,059
assumptions that we had here the first

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,279
one is that that horse is an actual

00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:15,699
Twitter user ok whoever is behind horse

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:18,399
is also an active Twitter user it is not

00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:21,029
a bot if it were a bot it would be very

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,709
hard to catch because it does not exist

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:26,259
and so we started with this assumption

00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:28,359
that that was the case we didn't know

00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:31,149
that but we had to assume that to move

00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:34,179
forward the second thing that we assumed

00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:36,660
is that horse Janus is a web developer a

00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:39,730
JavaScript developer a node developer

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,199
they are not someone who is outside the

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,209
industry right it's not a real estate

00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:44,889
agent who works all day selling houses

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,509
and then meet in the you know on the

00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:48,160
side is tweeting out things about

00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:50,860
JavaScript if you are a real estate

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,399
agent and you're here welcome we're glad

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,470
you're here

00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,079
but we just figured that was not you so

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,249
that was assumption that we made there

00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:03,999
about horse Jay is important another one

00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:07,389
that we made is that the person behind

00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:10,509
horse jeaious is probably following

00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:14,529
horse jeaious have you ever heard this

00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:17,769
one the person who commits the crime

00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:20,649
often returns to the scene of the crime

00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:24,129
were you heard that before there's a lot

00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:27,759
of crime analogies in here that's very

00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:32,289
true and we figured that whoever horse

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:35,049
Jay s is they probably cannot help but

00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:37,980
seeing themselves in their own timeline

00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:37,980
and chuckling

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:45,530
at the cleverness of what they have just

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,570
birthed to the world and so we assume

00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,400
that they are they're following that

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,860
account because they just can't help

00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,030
themselves

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,550
sort of developing a psychological

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,080
profile here the other assumption we

00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,000
made is that horse jeaious is a single

00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,980
person now I don't mean like horse

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,660
jeaious doesn't date I mean like it's

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,280
just one I want to clarify that first I

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,910
don't think that has anything to do with

00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,240
horse yes

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:13,460
if horse jas is more than one person and

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,780
actually I should clarify here we

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,180
actually operated under different

00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,560
assumptions here you were you were

00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,180
pretty sure that it was more than one

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,880
person and I was pretty sure there was

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:25,400
only one person part of the reason why I

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:31,580
was sure of that is because I wanted

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:33,140
that to be the case this is how I this

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,950
on my life works how I engage with

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:40,700
reality and so if you think about it if

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:42,620
horse j/s is one person that makes it a

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,690
relatively straightforward task in terms

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,690
of trying to find who it is if it's more

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:50,660
than one person now your analysis has an

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,670
exponent on it and the logic tree has a

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,110
ton more branches in it and there's a

00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,600
ton more things that you have to chase

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,750
down so actually finding one person

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,780
would be much much much easier than

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,800
trying to find multiple people trying to

00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,660
solve crimes where there's multiple

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,290
perpetrators involved as incredibly

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,850
difficult to do another something that

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,680
we made is that horse jeaious is not

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,410
using a private list and this is another

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,120
one where we sort of disagreed kind of

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,280
threw out Jasmine thought that they were

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,720
I didn't know what a private list was

00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,020
because I don't know how to use Twitter

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,030
apparently but apparently you can have a

00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,030
list of people that you follow that

00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,230
other people can't see and so if you go

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,880
to the horse Janus Twitter account

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,900
they're not following anyone they're

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,260
following an account called horse

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,840
context that is in tweeted in years and

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,970
so you know I assumed that that account

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,580
wasn't following anyone specifically but

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,160
that whoever was behind horse j/s what

00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,870
was happening was there there on the

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,910
internet they on Twitter they're like

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,630
hahaha and then they turn over to this

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,950
other account

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,440
the horse count and then they tweeted

00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,970
out that was the assumption and then the

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,710
last assumption we made the most

00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,900
important one is that machine learning

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,130
is the answer to everything it's it's

00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,090
like SharePoint it solves all your

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,560
problems hey can we cut that joke out of

00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:10,340
the video now I'm just kidding leave it

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,960
in and so again we're JavaScript

00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,890
developers we don't know anything about

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,080
machine learning

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:17,000
we're not data scientists right we're

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,560
just we're just trying to use it because

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,970
everybody's talking about it and they

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,030
won't shut up about it so here we are

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,530
let's let's make it work can it solve

00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,140
this problem so there's really

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,820
assumptions that we made and then the

00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,960
most in question that we important

00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,260
question that we had to ask at this

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,870
point was how in the world are we gonna

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,930
do this we used to have these calls when

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,130
we were first starting out where we

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,630
would just sit there and talk for like

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,400
30 minutes to an hour and at the end of

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,960
the discussion we just had nothing right

00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,700
under the bit like we didn't know what

00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,350
conferences that we were going to and

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,390
like you know how our summer is going

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,450
but we didn't really bother than that

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,160
and and so and I was starting to get

00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,660
really really worried because after the

00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,850
day after we had submitted the abstract

00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,740
you know we we submit the abstract to

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,060
J's comp us they said hey

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,790
congratulations

00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:07,340
and I called jasmine I said oh crap I

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,480
got some bad news I was hoping for an A

00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,480
but they said yeah because

00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:21,110
so we had to get started and we did not

00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:22,639
know how to get started this was

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:28,059
actually the hardest part of the whole

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:33,769
project fortunately there's this guy

00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:37,489
this this is Vadim this is actually dr.

00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:39,709
Vadim Vadim works on the azure team and

00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:43,519
he has a PhD in computational biophysics

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:49,339
I have a Bachelors of Science in

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:53,179
Business Administration Vadim is

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:57,439
slightly more qualified than me to solve

00:15:53,179 --> 00:16:01,519
this problem so when we sat down and we

00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:04,160
met with Vadim I explained to him what

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,739
we were trying to do and he said okay

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:11,600
and what is your data set and I said

00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:16,730
it's Twitter all of Twitter is the data

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,980
set it was like ooh and then he told me

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,720
something that was that completely sort

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:25,369
of changed the trajectory of this

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:28,040
project and what he said was you don't

00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:31,999
have a machine learning problem you have

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,679
a statistics problem now what I didn't

00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,329
understand about machine learning is

00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,759
that what machine learning does is it

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:40,279
takes statistical models that you've

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,379
already created and it crunches those

00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:44,809
models to then make predictions about

00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,519
what might happen in the future so for

00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:48,920
instance you could take all of the data

00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,869
about horse j/s all the times that it's

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,660
tweeted and then what machine learning

00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:55,999
can do is tell you based on this pattern

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,429
it's probably going to tweet again at

00:16:55,999 --> 00:17:01,160
this time what machine learning is not

00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:03,499
going to do is create the model for you

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,069
and give you the answer that just does

00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:10,610
not work and so what we had to do here

00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:13,010
was was really not about machine

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:16,279
learning as much as it was about data

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:19,220
and data science there is another person

00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:20,569
who works at Microsoft I actually don't

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,730
know where this guy works this is Matt

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,559
Veloso I'm not sure where he is in the

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,100
organization but he tweeted this and I

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,100
was like oh

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:41,840
if you take one thing from this

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:43,520
presentation so so the next time

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,680
somebody at your company goes we need

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,140
machine learning like what maybe you

00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,020
don't you might just need a regular old

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:57,770
query tell them to it hold your horses

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:59,150
you just might need a query oh I wish I

00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,240
could say that was the last one but it's

00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,410
probably not oh all right

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,150
so this is this is a really important

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,900
fact and one thing that I I think that

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,060
you're gonna take away from this

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,920
presentation is that machine learning is

00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:14,300
very powerful it's very interesting it's

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,760
a very remarkable technology but it you

00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,530
plug it in when you need it and I think

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,470
the thing that we all struggle with is

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:24,440
when do I need it and the answer is I

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,330
don't know but as we walk through this

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,160
presentation we're gonna get to a point

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,780
where we actually do use some machine

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,080
learning and you'll see that it's just

00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,700
one piece of the puzzle ok so a lot of

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,170
the things that you can do you still do

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,630
those things but there's gonna be that

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,280
one thing where you're like I can't we

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,440
would need an army of people to do this

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,780
and it's one thing and that's where you

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:49,580
plug machine learning in that that's the

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:52,090
hole that it fills so with that we were

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:56,570
ready to get started yes what do we do

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:59,480
well first thing we wanted to do was

00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:02,390
grab all these tweets and put them in a

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,390
datastore no the challenge was was

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:07,400
trying to figure out how how far back we

00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,720
wanted to go on how how much or how much

00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,470
tweets how many tweets did you want to

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,810
collect so to help us with this we use

00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:17,990
this account called horse-playing j/s

00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:21,020
thanks thanks to Trisha wherever you are

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,250
thank you for for informing us about

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,800
this and this account this room was

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:28,100
really helpful because what horse Blaine

00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,860
does is for every horse j/s tweet horse

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,260
plane comes in and mentions the purse

00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,330
the the originator tweet and then quotes

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,670
the the actual tweet that they they

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,490
posted yes thank you very much was it

00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:42,730
Patricia you said yeah

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,740
thank you and horse thank you yeah horse

00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,000
plane has ratted you out let me just

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,950
tell you because if it wasn't for this

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,870
account there is no way we could have

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,830
gotten started it have been so so - yes

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:56,440
so so so we're like thinking okay how do

00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,990
we get started of course we need to grab

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,900
we need to you know use Twitter API to

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:04,450
grab grab this data and put it in a data

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,000
store but how what what do we build and

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:10,510
what do we use to do that so we thought

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,610
of a serverless solution which is on the

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:16,480
top left here in this graph called a

00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:18,370
juror functions it's a service

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,470
serverless solution that allows you to

00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:23,980
do event-driven event-driven code

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:25,540
execution we were at Microsoft we have a

00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,460
bunch of credits so and it's the fastest

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,410
cheapest way for us to do it we worked

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,429
on it look it's what the greatest thing

00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,900
about working there is you just have

00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,030
like all of as your like I'll just take

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:37,090
that whole data center for my project

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:41,740
for J Escom oh yeah et nos we've got it

00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:44,770
right so and then and then we use we use

00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:48,220
that to hit to get get our connect to

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:50,920
the Twitter API we use the 399 version

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,540
of that which you know can cause a few

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,860
like rate limit issues and I'll talk a

00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,220
little bit about that in the next slide

00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:59,980
of how we overcame that and then we put

00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:03,490
that into a datastore and then we used

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,679
also cognitive services text API I do

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,080
some text analytics on some of the some

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,510
of the tweets and then out of all that

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,120
is was consumed by graph through a

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,220
four-horse just to figure out what the

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,690
results are well what the result set was

00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,300
so we can kind of make sense of all this

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:22,059
data and and one of the important things

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,800
here is that this is just the API and

00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:25,420
this took most of the time almost the

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,730
entirety of our time was spent just

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,980
building the API which is I feel like

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,660
how everything else goes right like 80%

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,510
of the work is spent doing something

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,860
that nobody ever sees but it's got to be

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,860
done we also learned some interesting

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:42,880
things about about DB because

00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:44,530
cosmos TV uses the DB API I didn't

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,500
know much about it I still don't I don't

00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,850
I would I said jazzing a message be like

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,530
can you can you please run this

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,790
aggregation query you have no idea

00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,390
what's going on here and should be like

00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,570
sure

00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,790
and yeah my my browser history for the

00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,809
last like two months has been

00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:01,510
fascinating it's all it's all the

00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:03,970
MongoDB document mine is like every

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,830
Stack Overflow post on MongoDB ever ever

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:09,610
I've been there I've been to every

00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:11,260
single one so we learned a lot it was

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,059
very very difficult and there were a lot

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,390
of times we just wanted to quit right

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:21,640
yeah but how can you quit when you have

00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:23,799
free free credits right right so just to

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,960
talk a little about the azure function

00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:27,669
that we use we use this function we

00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,900
called it our function half at horse

00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:32,169
hunt because I mean obviously we're

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,419
hunting for hunting for a horse and what

00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:36,309
the function app does is it hosts our

00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,540
functions and then it's also a place

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:40,240
where you can add like configuration

00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,340
file if it configuration so for example

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,000
we know Twitter the Twitter API we you

00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,590
need need keys you need a token keys for

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,780
secret we're secret's out of your

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:55,270
firstborn child yeah exactly and and so

00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,760
so the nice thing about that is that you

00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,320
know you you have one place to add your

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,120
configuration and then all your

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,740
functions all your functions already

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,929
have access to all of that so you don't

00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,150
have to you know copy and paste it you

00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:10,030
know billions of times work for your

00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,910
functions to work with the API or

00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:15,250
whatever else you're connecting it to so

00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:17,919
for so the first so we used to event

00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,929
event function event based functions the

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,840
first one is a timer the timer the timer

00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:26,080
event function and what that does it it

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,929
would run we had one that ran at 1:00

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,900
a.m. every day and it would get it would

00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:33,790
collect the tweets from from the prior

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,350
day that horse yes that we didn't have

00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,750
in our data store yet from the prior day

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:40,720
and dumped it into our cosmos TV

00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,970
instance and then we came with the

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,960
challenge of backfilling going back as

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,960
far as we could

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,390
we went us back as far as as a horse

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,730
plane j/s account did so that we could

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,770
kind of easily run our queries and you

00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,380
know and compare and compare the

00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:58,990
original tweets and the horse tweets and

00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,090
with that that was where we really came

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:03,160
across some reliving issues so we had

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,390
this we had a timer trigger or a timer

00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,570
triggered function

00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,890
would run run on a schedule and this

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:12,460
really easy to set up and used to do it

00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:14,170
with a cron job and it would it stop and

00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,410
eventually it was done when we told the

00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:21,070
stuff we kind of had we gave it a few a

00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:22,840
few dates a few dates and time and got

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,360
and collected as many tweets as we could

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,920
and then once that was done we we shut

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,679
it off and it's literally as easy as a

00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,390
click of a button and then when we

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,660
wanted to consume that data we used a

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:36,910
HTTP event function and that was what we

00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:41,260
used to to get all of our outputs for

00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:43,929
our queries and our results so what when

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,580
it comes to when so in the end like like

00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:47,470
Burke said we use pretty much built API

00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,240
that collects the data puts in a

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:55,480
datastore and then also to query that

00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:58,210
data now for a cosmos DB we we had a we

00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,880
had so Kozma DB is a implication of

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,400
document DB I believe and what the nice

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,809
thing about it is that the the documents

00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,000
your document structure will all look

00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:09,460
just will will look the same but the

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,790
thing that differs is the API that you

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,410
use to to consume your data with so

00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:17,970
there's different options for example

00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:20,590
there's sequel Cassandra there's a graph

00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,110
API yeah there's all kinds of stuff the

00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:26,410
one we use as mentioned before was

00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:28,360
MongoDB and in these two screenshots

00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:30,220
here where I'm just it's just an example

00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,470
of what the structure kind of looked

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,600
kind of looked like so we had a horse

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,799
object and that would contain the horse

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,000
J's tweet and some additional metadata

00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:41,500
by the way which was like completely

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,900
empty horse Chase is really good at

00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,780
covering their tracks and then we had an

00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:49,000
original object which also had the

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:53,559
original tweet and some additional

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,500
metadata in that and then we when we

00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:59,320
additional initially aside from also

00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,200
consuming consuming the data and like

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,870
running queries to put in charts and

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,590
stuff to make sense of this data we also

00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:10,780
used the cognitive services API

00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:14,200
specifically their text analytics API to

00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:16,540
run some analysis on the tweets so

00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,020
cognitive Services is pretty much the AI

00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,310
and ml that

00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,620
you don't have to do we just kind of

00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,300
it's pretty much just an API it has an

00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,920
endpoint you give it you give it some

00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,350
data or you give it some info and it

00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,960
spits out pizza or gives you return

00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,460
something back to you and the nice thing

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,050
about that is that we don't have to do

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,400
we don't have to build our models we

00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,290
have to do anything we just had to just

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,840
hit an API endpoint which is really nice

00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:42,380
so what you're looking at here is and

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:45,280
the the demo site for the text analytics

00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,260
API and what's happening here is that

00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,480
the SEMO you put on in some text and if

00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:54,470
you can see here that I have a text or a

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,750
tweet from one of the the the data store

00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,960
or from one of the text or text from one

00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,890
of the tweets that was from an original

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,270
original one of the original tweets in

00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:07,580
our in our cosmos DB instance and and on

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,990
to the right there we have we see it's

00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,570
measuring things like sentiment and

00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:14,120
keywords and things like that and then

00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:17,000
on the bottom here we is an example of

00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,610
what it looks like in our database or in

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,850
our in our database collection and or in

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:24,980
our collection excuse me and and what we

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,690
pretty much really ended up using was

00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,010
the keyword sentiment was kind of cool

00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,260
and what sentiment does is it's pretty

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,870
much measures whether some whether or

00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,720
not text is positive or negative so

00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:37,250
anything above 50% would be perceived as

00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,680
positive anything below that's negative

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,570
and we didn't really use that but the

00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,190
keyword the keyword really came in handy

00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,410
for us right yeah and you'll see that

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,000
here in a bit how we use that but that

00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,920
was that was interesting because the

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,850
sentiment is sort of what you think it

00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,320
would be used for but that's not

00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:54,110
actually what we used it we used it for

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,420
key phrase recognition and if you would

00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:59,120
otherwise have to do by hand right that

00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,730
would be fun exactly and like and we did

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,560
discover that using set the sentiment

00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,510
analysis on hoarseness one wasn't going

00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,310
to work at all because because it's not

00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,950
it's a lot of it's just nonsense or

00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:12,320
sarcasm and computers as it turns out

00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:16,010
are not great with sarcasm true story

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,200
right and and in fact a horse some of

00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,880
the horses tweets actually broke some of

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,610
our functions when we tried to like to

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,340
when we tried to get text analysis on it

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:28,240
because even like the text API would say

00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,680
I don't know what you this is two words

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,330
this is not a sentence

00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:36,740
sentence like this is not coherent I

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:39,830
can't help so so with that with all that

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,820
stuff we finally got some we finally

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,890
started to make sense of our day we

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,660
started to work on some of the results

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,980
so Burke you want to talk a little bit

00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,140
about those results right you don't want

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,780
to talk about results do you want to see

00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:54,110
this yes why did you waste so much time

00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:56,900
already all right okay let's do it then

00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:59,090
all right so here are the results from

00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,890
all of the work that we did all of the

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,760
weeks of sifting through this data here

00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:06,980
we go the first analysis that we did is

00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,560
something called a time series analysis

00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,810
now I'm about to make some broad and

00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,840
inaccurate statements about the study of

00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:17,120
Statistics because I am NOT an expert in

00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,040
statistics so don't add me if you want

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,650
to come see me later at the party and

00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,410
explain why I'm wrong I will be happy to

00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:26,840
hear you out but for the purposes of

00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:28,670
this talk grant me some leniency here as

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,000
I say some horribly wrong things here we

00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,000
go

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,960
a time series analysis is when you look

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,240
at a series of events as they occur over

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,140
a period of time it's actually quite

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,150
simple I can't wait to hear how that was

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,280
so terribly wrong but I'm sure I messed

00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:49,760
that up so the first thing that we did

00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:52,160
was we we took all of the horse J s

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,720
tweets and we looked at them over a

00:29:52,160 --> 00:30:01,700
period of time so let's do that this is

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:06,130
a graph a scatter of every single horse

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:08,560
J s tweet that we had in the database

00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,060
something should pop out to you right

00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,570
away

00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,570
what do you see

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:27,809
they sleep ah are they really a

00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:29,070
developer then now this is where this

00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,809
really starts to get interesting because

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,029
what you're gonna see is the same thing

00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:35,009
we saw which is that we would go in with

00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:37,049
these assumptions and then we would run

00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:38,940
these these queries and look at these

00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:40,980
graphs and Riaan have completely

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,470
different realizations so you almost

00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,139
don't know what you're looking for until

00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:48,419
the graph reveals that to you here's

00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:50,070
what's really interesting on the bottom

00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:53,159
here what we're looking at are dates

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:56,429
okay so this is 2016 and this is up to

00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,500
July over here on the side is supposed

00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:00,720
to be time

00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,029
this is chart Jas and I learned to

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,220
charge a s about three weeks ago so I

00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:07,169
have no idea what I'm doing I tried to

00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,840
convert it into 24-hour format on the

00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:11,490
side but it's actually not correct let

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,889
me tell you what this chart actually

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:20,360
reads right here right here ish is about

00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:24,049
10:00 p.m. Central Standard Time

00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:28,200
okay right here where it picks back up

00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:31,740
this is about 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.

00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:37,820
Central Standard Time what does that

00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:40,970
tell us they're in Texas that's right

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:44,029
or they are in the Eastern time zone

00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:48,619
they are most likely in Central Standard

00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:50,269
Time or Eastern Time most likely they're

00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:51,590
probably not in mountain time because

00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:53,179
that would be a bedtime of like 9

00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,470
o'clock and they're definitely not a

00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:56,629
Pacific time because it would be a

00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,159
bedtime of 8 o'clock and waking up and

00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:59,629
starting tweeting at 4:00 and that

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,720
definitely doesn't sound like a

00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:04,609
developer to me except for a couple of

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,409
nights like right here in January this

00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:08,059
is like 4:30 a.m. I don't know what

00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:11,450
horse Jess was doing but there was a big

00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:13,039
party in January also this one here this

00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:14,479
was also a late night I don't know what

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,909
not sure what's happening there new

00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:18,320
years it could been yeah exactly

00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:19,700
but other than that they're getting a

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,440
good eight hours of sleep and they're

00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:26,629
not active at night good for you horse

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,190
j/s healthy lifestyle choices okay

00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:30,619
so the next thing we want to do here is

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,970
we want to look at the original tweets

00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:34,849
the quoted tweets we're going to do the

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:37,849
same analysis on those tweets okay so

00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:41,349
here's those tweets now what you'll

00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:46,119
notice is that it looks kind of the same

00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:49,129
okay we've got this big opening here

00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:53,450
it's a little bit more populated but it

00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:55,759
looks remarkably the same what can we

00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:59,330
glean from that well we could assume

00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:01,340
that possibly horse j/s is quoting

00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,529
people that are in the same time zone so

00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,729
they're quoting friends people that they

00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:07,580
know people that live in close proximity

00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:08,779
maybe again we're making assumptions

00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:13,940
from the data here but we don't know

00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:18,710
anything yet at this point I said okay

00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:21,830
well let's do this let's overlay the

00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:24,229
horse data on top of the original data

00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:26,029
and see what we get I'm not sure what I

00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:29,799
was expecting to find that just sounded

00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:29,799
like something you would do with a chart

00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:41,029
so this is what we've got now this is

00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:45,169
interesting the blue dots are the

00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:47,720
original tweets okay the the red dots or

00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:51,379
the pinkish dots are horses tweets

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:54,470
now on accident I gave these things a

00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:59,179
transparency of 0.5 because I thought it

00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:00,649
was pretty but that actually was

00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:02,240
interesting because what you'll notice

00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:05,629
is there are some places where it is

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,599
pink bright pink see there you see there

00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:13,119
you see there you know what's happening

00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:15,770
there what's happening there same time

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,710
these tweets are occurring at almost the

00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:26,690
exact same time some of them within

00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:32,119
seconds of each other they doesn't lie

00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:36,490
that is awful quick just saying so from

00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:39,290
this we made this assumption that okay

00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:42,649
if the tweets are very close together

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:46,579
let's say 60 seconds or less it's highly

00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:48,020
likely that horse Jas is following those

00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:49,639
people directly now remember I'm

00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,560
operating under the assumption that this

00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:55,849
person sees the tweet and then tweets as

00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:59,810
horse J s okay so I said let's pull out

00:34:55,849 --> 00:35:02,180
all of the tweets that occur within 60

00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,089
seconds of the original tweet so let's

00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:07,579
do that

00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:09,890
there they are okay you'll see that this

00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:12,560
there's like this one over here again I

00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,119
told you I'm terrible at charge a s I'd

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,500
like to apologize at the charge a s

00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,950
people their product deserves better

00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,950
than me

00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:24,290
okay so there's not a lot of them okay

00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,940
now if we spread this out to like five

00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,440
minutes to 10 minutes it starts to get

00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,690
more interesting but then may that's a

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,060
lot of time on Twitter y'all five

00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:35,510
minutes is a ton of time the other thing

00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:38,780
is is that the analysis that we then did

00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:41,030
from here is we said okay for each one

00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,520
of these people let's get all of their

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,490
followers from the Twitter API okay and

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,790
then we can compare those followers and

00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:52,310
see which followers do those accounts

00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:54,790
have in common and that's how we're

00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,790
going to get them

00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,100
and that was an incredibly difficult

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,660
task here's why Brendan Eich was one of

00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:08,550
those people and that dude's got like

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:10,830
200,000 followers West boss was one of

00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,230
those people that guys got like 200,000

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,890
followers and what we really quickly

00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:18,690
learned is first of all the Twitter API

00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,820
just rate limited the crap out of us I

00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,100
mean it was just all day long so that

00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,450
was that was number one so basically

00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,800
what you'd have to do is you would test

00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,920
but then when she hit the rate limit

00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,470
used to stop for 15 minutes and wait

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,090
some imagine that as a dev process right

00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,620
sometimes I would just end our did we

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,600
just end our days like oh great limits

00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:39,270
happen again let's just go he done so

00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,830
yeah all right so what we did was we had

00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:45,270
to set up these processes that would

00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:48,140
recover by themselves so we did that and

00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,140
here's what we found

00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,560
all right so after all this what do we

00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,420
know horse jeaious is probably in

00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:02,880
central time or eastern time or the rest

00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:04,830
of it was a vast waste of my time so

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,990
when it comes to frequency analysis I

00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,910
don't have as good as a definition as

00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,710
Berk does he as Brooke did for time

00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:12,480
series or for the time series analysis

00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,450
so I'm not gonna give you an example or

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,660
I'm going to show you the example of

00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:21,150
what frequency analysis is and when it

00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:24,480
hasn't released our project or project

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:28,290
horse so one thing that we did is that

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,840
we ran an aggregation query to find out

00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:35,250
the people that horse Jess had quoted

00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:36,990
more than five times and this is pretty

00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,790
much answering the question what is

00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,770
horse you know who does horse just like

00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:43,800
to tweet whose horse just like to quote

00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:46,230
and so from this we got some really

00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,360
interesting from some interesting data

00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:51,870
and some interesting results so if you

00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,510
notice who you're your left guess your

00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:57,390
left your left here that there is

00:37:54,510 --> 00:38:00,060
somebody who has been quoted a lot of

00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:02,100
times and then there's also a cluster of

00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,830
people after that have been quoted

00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,560
pretty pretty often as well and then

00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:08,530
notice that

00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,960
as as you move over to the right there

00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:13,150
starts to level off a little bit and

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,900
level off a bit so it seems that

00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:19,810
horseshoes has a circle of people or

00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:22,330
other friends or maybe he's just or

00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:25,150
maybe they are just a superfan or maybe

00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,530
they are just reordered maybe they have

00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,970
that private list I don't know I'm still

00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:32,350
convinced and it might they might have a

00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:34,570
private list but anyway but so we so we

00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:37,590
kind of focus in on those on that right

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:41,230
we're right on that high number of

00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:44,770
quotes that occurrence of recurrences of

00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:46,510
quotes per account and we when we take a

00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:49,210
look we took a little bit closer look at

00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:51,970
that and we we use the metadata from

00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,290
from those from those tweets to gather

00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,730
some more info you want talk a little

00:38:53,290 --> 00:39:00,040
bit more about that book yeah absolutely

00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:01,810
so it's important to note that here we

00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,500
we kind of decided that horse J us

00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:06,880
probably tweets themselves a lot again

00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,590
because it would take a lot of restraint

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,450
not to do that and we just feel like

00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:13,000
that's not who that is

00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,770
that just that to us just does not

00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,410
restraint does not sound like horse

00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:20,200
neighs so what you're looking at here is

00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:21,850
a Graham app here of all of the people

00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,480
that live in either central or Eastern

00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:27,430
time there's only six of all these

00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,980
people and yes I know the names are

00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:32,050
bordered at the bottom we're trying to

00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:36,040
obscure some data here of all of these

00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:39,840
people only six one of them is in Texas

00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:44,050
and there are five in the New York area

00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:47,800
all right so from this we can again make

00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:49,780
a few assumptions about horse jeaious we

00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,980
could make the assumption and we sort of

00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:57,540
did that horse jeaious probably lives in

00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:59,770
the New York area also of these other

00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,690
four people that are in the New York

00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:03,700
area with them almost all of those

00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:07,270
people are on the left side of this

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:09,970
chart so it is highly likely that horse

00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:11,500
a s is in New York or the New York area

00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:13,900
they have a group of friends in that

00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,970
area they are they are quoting those

00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:19,210
people because their friends and it's

00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:21,310
funny so we decided from this

00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,320
that horse Jas lives in the Eastern time

00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,520
zone which took us to the next part in

00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,920
which we learned about some machine

00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,550
learning yeah so this is the output of

00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,290
the text analysis that we got and so so

00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,510
like I showed you before we put all our

00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:37,599
text analysis in a separate collection

00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:39,339
ran an aggregate query I got really good

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,609
at arrogation if you if you ever need

00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:43,900
everybody I had never used MongoDB

00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:47,260
before so it was a learning experience

00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:50,200
to start a consulting service for good

00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:52,270
to be aggregation queries and what we

00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,190
did is rent aggregation query on all the

00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,810
keywords we want to kind of figure out

00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:59,920
this is kind of answering the question

00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:02,170
what does what makes horse GS tweet our

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,750
quote specific tweets what what are the

00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:08,020
keywords that makes horse jeaious want

00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:10,839
to want to quote a tweet and if you take

00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,400
a look here so actually so on the left

00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:14,140
here the first two there are kind of

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,650
kind of Givens there JavaScript and

00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,720
jeaious

00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,369
and I feel like that's kind of like even

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,599
those are even though even though those

00:41:18,369 --> 00:41:20,980
are blurred I think that those are

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,540
probably a given you would you'd

00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,450
probably assume that those it would be

00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,880
first two and then there was some in

00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:30,760
here that were actually kind of

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,540
surprising for example node was a rule

00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,820
further to the right and and that was to

00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,140
the and then also there was which is

00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,480
actually kind of interesting because it

00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:42,490
actually came I believe came before it

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,740
was there was more NPM than node

00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,420
significantly more NPM yeah it was like

00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,830
a little further further apart from each

00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,330
other on the chart which is actually

00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,980
really interesting because you would

00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,480
think that they would kind of be like a

00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,070
little bit more equal because they can

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,830
only think when I think of note I think

00:41:54,070 --> 00:42:00,520
also of NPM so it was that was a little

00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:01,810
interesting but yeah so the the the

00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,510
interesting thing about that even though

00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:09,339
that we didn't really gather too much

00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:12,480
about our about a who horse yes is from

00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:14,500
from this chart we did we did kind of

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,050
confirm some of our assumptions for

00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:19,240
example we thought we assumed that

00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:21,460
horses web developer and the keywords

00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,859
that we got from our aggregation and

00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,690
this chart kind of confirmed some of

00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:26,950
those stuff right and and once we figure

00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,330
out who was that there was actually a

00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,859
key piece of evidence in here that we're

00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:32,000
not showing you that was actually like

00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:35,090
yep of course it is

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,490
all right um so the last thing we

00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:39,020
alright sources and this one's this

00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,760
one's super interesting so remember we

00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,380
talked about whenever you commit a crime

00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,700
there's 20 pieces of evidence that you

00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:47,450
leave behind that point directly to you

00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:52,610
this is it so whenever you tweet just

00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:55,970
FYI there is a sources property that you

00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:58,670
are sending that is the origination of

00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:02,420
your tweet and that could be the web

00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:05,660
that could be your device your tablet

00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:07,490
whatever it is you send a source to

00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:11,240
Twitter and Twitter records that source

00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:15,020
and horse jeaious is no exception it

00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:17,180
recorded that source for them and lucky

00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:21,380
for us that source was kind of

00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:25,930
interesting on the left we have the web

00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:29,180
client and on the right we have Android

00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:31,130
now here's what's really interesting of

00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,380
all those people in the chart that we

00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,220
showed you before there's only a handful

00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,220
using Android

00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:45,890
and of all the six people that were our

00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:45,890
suspects in New York there's only one

00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:54,710
and this was the moment at Friday where

00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:58,100
I said to Jasmine oh my gosh

00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,100

00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,400
located in New York we know that there

00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,290
are certain subjects that they tweet

00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,920
about more than others we have obscured

00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:23,980
those results from you we know that they

00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:28,450
are one of our six suspects and we know

00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:30,760
that they use Android so with that and

00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:32,050
some key information that we have not

00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,990
shown you otherwise you'd be able to

00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:39,860
