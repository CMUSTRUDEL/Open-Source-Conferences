Description: 
	There’s a lot to be said about pressing pause, resetting and unfolding that roadmap often to see if you’re still going in the right direction.

Being a brilliant dev is great, but being a brilliant dev who understands balance, how to manage time, how to focus and be aware of when they’re most productive and effective… well, this person becomes a super dev.

OMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/

Hi, everyone.

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,680
How are you?

00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,040
Can you hear me okay?

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,540
Awesome.

00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,460
All right.

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,200
I'm really, really excited to be here today with you all.

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,699
Look, yes, my name is Patima.

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,109
So, a quick introduction.

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:28,369
I'm the head of product and design at 7 west media in Australia.

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:30,589
I'm from Perth.

00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:34,110
And we have very adorable quokka animals.

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,470
That's me traveling here for the first time ever in Europe.

00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,530
And I'm super, super excited to be here.

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,969
It's amazing and it's quite an experience.

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,930
So, I bring over with me a little bit of Aussie slang.

00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:59,120
So, as I have been told that my accent is quite strong, so I hope you can all understand

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
me.

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,509
But we do like to have a few idioms where we can connect and concatenate words together.

00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:10,729
And the words I want to run through you all today is hard yakka.

00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:14,820
Who has heard of the term before.

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,660
We have a few hands there.

00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,410
Hey in the back there.

00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:26,840
Now, hard yakka is the meaning of it is basically hard work.

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,960
And it comes from rural slang, essentially.

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,350
So, in the country there's wood, which is referred to as yakka.

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,390
And hard yakka is that meaning of hard work and work ethic.

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,350
And this term reminds me of my granddad.

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,939
Look how cute he is.

00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,380
He's adorable.

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,619
But he's one of the most hard working people I know, and he's got an amazing work ethic.

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,540
And just one of those people that has sage advice for any scenario.

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,130
And he's one of my greatest role models.

00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:06,450
So, he'll say things like, work hard and be good to your mother.

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,120
Listen before you speak.

00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,910
And never say gonna, because if you're gonna, you haven't done it yet.

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:22,300
And he's taught me a lot about work ethic and having just, I suppose, that determination

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:29,220
to really apply myself and to work hard no matter no matter what the circumstance and

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,960
just set goals and go for it.

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,460
So, he's really taught me a lot about resilience and diligence.

00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,770
And determination, of course.

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,570
But this transition of work ethic and hard yakka in our industry has been something that

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,510
I have been trying to adjust to for this, I don't know, 15 years I have been here working

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,020
in the web.

00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:58,390
And the I suppose that concept of it is tricky because, well, the state of our industry is

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,420
something that requires a lot of mental willpower.

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,310
And there's something that is not quite the same about it like other industries would

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,360
have in a traditional sense.

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,680
So, I suppose I just wanted to ask you all a few questions today, because this is something

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,840
that's been swirling around in my mind for a little bit.

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,420
And it's the observation of, I suppose, what's become normal in our industry.

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,940
Constant learning.

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,070
So, what I mean by this, as you know in our industry, we're always learning something

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,070
new.

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,230
I suppose here's a simple question for you all.

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,560
Who has learned something new this week?

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,850
Last week?

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,340
Last month?

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,730
Daily?

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,930
It's continuous and constant learning.

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,660
And it's also continuous change.

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,560
Another question for you all.

00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,050
Who is doing the exact same workflow as what they did two years ago?

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,560
One year ago?

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,840
One month ago?

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Okay.

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Okay.

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,790
Sounds about right.

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,770
Also, community.

00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,450
No, connectivity, I've jumped forward.

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,570
So, who hops on their laptops or their machines after work?

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,750
Or on the weekends?

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,180
Oh, that's a lot of hands.

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,180
Yep.

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,180
Me too.

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,180
Me too.

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,380
And who goes out and hangs out with the community?

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,280
Who runs or volunteers at or attends meetups all the time?

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,070
Uh huh, uh huh.

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,070
Contributions.

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,140
Who is contributed to open source software in this last week?

00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,860
This month?

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,580
This year?

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,580
Yeah.

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,160
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,480
And the last C that I wanted to bring in and talk about is in the state of our industry

00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,770
is also creativity.

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,720
And in that sense of, how many of you have a side project going on or are working on

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,280
a side project, have worked on side projects, thinking about working on a side project?

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Yeah.

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,040
That's a that's a lot happening, right?

00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,160
That's we're doing all of this stuff.

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,120
Probably on top of full time work or full time study, and, you know, that's that's a

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,780
lot of hours that we're putting into this world.

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,900
So, then I kind of got to thinking about, you know, what is it that we value and normalize

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,830
as good, strong work ethic in our industry?

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,620
What's the hard yakka here?

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,820
And really, you know, it's it's what we value, right?

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,980
As human beings and as professionals.

00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,720
And you kind of hear these kind of praises that swirl around and humble brags that happen.

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,340
These might sound familiar.

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,500
You know, there's Dev, it's super fast.

00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,080
And then you might do the whole, I worked nine hours today.

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,410
Well, I worked ten hours today.

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,060
I worked 24.

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,580
It's like this humble bragging that's happening.

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,340
And, you know, it's this kind of sense, oh, well, that is what we consider maybe working

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,480
harder.

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,660
But then we've also got this kind of world surrounding us as well which is, you know,

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,570
blog posts and contributing and working on side projects and mentoring and all these

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,020
other things that we do to kind of keep progressing our career forward.

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,600
And then we kind of have this really hard wired mentality.

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,780
But, you know, we do all these things of, well, so much to do and I'm so busy and these

00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,490
are the general normal conversations that we have.

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,210
And to me I kind of I kind of worry.

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:48,530
Because what we're saying to not only ourselves, but to the people that are looking up to us

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,840
or that we speak to day to day, the things that we're praising each other about are saying

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
these.

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,190
I suppose the translations, that somehow high performance is shipping things quickly.

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,450
Regardless of quality, maintainability.

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,410
Yeah, smash it out.

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,790
Let's get other things done.

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,889
Or that clocking becomes this badge of pride that's somehow related to productivity because

00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:19,270
we're doing so much all the time and we're always busy.

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,470
Is that a good thing?

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,550
And doing all of these things somehow is expected of us to get ahead in this industry.

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,950
If you're not doing all of those things I was listing out before with the state of our

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,790
industry somehow, you know, are we performing the best that we can?

00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,790
Are we meeting our potential?

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:46,320
And the other thing I'm reading into it is, if we're always busy and needed, then this

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,890
relates to somehow the I'm valuable conversation.

00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,640
So, I see a few nods out there.

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,370
And this is kind of my reaction to it.

00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,720
Like, what is happening to our industry?

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,470
It doesn't quite sound right.

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,470
Kind of like this.

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,680
It's like a little yeah.

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,490
Oh, I love it.

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,030
So, suppose when we're kind of looking at Googling.

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,230
Good old Google.

00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,990
Leveling up, you know?

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:22,130
If we want to level up as developer or human being, then all of a sudden, we have to go,

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,700
well, what are the steps that we need to take to do that?

00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,790
And all the things that are expected of us, are they fair?

00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:35,330
And I came across this Tweet from Eric Elliott a little while ago and it really got me thinking.

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,710
It's one of those reflective pieces, right?

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,670
It's like, think of the most extraordinary developer you have worked with and the traits

00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,750
and qualities they have.

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,810
And the results of the survey, he wrote a great blog post about it.

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,350
Feel free to go forth and check it out.

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:59,240
He came out with these top five qualities, communicative, honest, top five traits, problem

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,240
solver, skilled, mentor, teacher, excellent learner, passionate.

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Cool.

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Not bad.

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,820
These are things I would personally expect any kind of working professional to have these

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,050
kinds of skills and traits.

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,850
But, you know, kind of add to this, we see lots of mind maps around about the state of

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,850
the web.

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,529
And, wow, that just keeps going.

00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:29,640
And that's from frontend to backend to DevOps to, you know, sitting in this full stack world.

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,870
It's so full on and we're just learning all these things constantly.

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,370
And all the expectations.

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,620
We should know everything.

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,970
And then we just it's tiring.

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,150
You know?

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,710
Do we do we accept this?

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:49,601
Do we accept that this is a healthy environment that we want people to come into our industry

00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:51,160
and go, hey, yeah?

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,750
Working ten hours to 15 hours to getting no sleep and being busy all the time is cool.

00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,750
Yeah.

00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,670
I don't know.

00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,860
I don't know.

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,600
With this save the world, I feel like it's no wonder we're exhausted.

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,850
And it's no wonder we're seeing people talk about, I suppose, the signs and symptoms of

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,850
burnout.

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:19,110
And I find that really concerning because there's some really talented people that are

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,000
kind of hitting this stage and then not able to recover.

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,350
And they're leaving the industry or changing the industry or taking these massive breaks.

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:34,820
And when we're talking about it in a physical sense, it's actually a thing called OTS.

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,620
Turn out, it's a symptom.

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:44,080
Overtraining syndrome is something that is used to describe athletes who have completely

00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,110
trained themselves to a state of, or overtrained themselves to a state of mentor or physical

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,170
exhaustion.

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,580
And this is mega.

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:59,370
This is an imbalance of the simple equation which is that training should be the result

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,790
of workout and recovery.

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:09,430
But when an athlete is diagnosed with OTS, they're often out for 4 6 months.

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:16,160
Now, I've broke an few limbs in my time and it only puts me out for 6 8 weeks.

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,750
So, this is massive.

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,500
And if we translate this into how this can work with the mind, if we're burnt out from

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,710
just mental exhaustion of keeping up with the industry and how the state of how things

00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:33,610
are, then our energy is just going to be pretty low.

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,889
And it's pretty hard to recover back from zero.

00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:44,850
, you know, when we get towards our energy who plays Mortal Kombat or has?

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,710
That's the analogy.

00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,620
When your power bar goes low.

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,290
And you're the at stage, you could lose this game.

00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,290
Boo.

00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:00,930
But really, with that, is when you've got full energy, you can actually you can do so

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,930
much more.

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,940
You can be creative and energetic.

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,080
And, you know, just be really inspired.

00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:13,600
But when you're when you're low on energy, you start to have, you know, have these uncharacteristic

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,100
things happen to yourself like you start forgetting things.

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,820
You start having trouble with communication.

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,820
You know?

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,850
You start just being overwhelmed or it's just it gets too much sometimes.

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:32,270
And this is something that I've experienced at one point in my time over that 15 years.

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:40,170
There was a point where I was working so much and not getting much sleep and what I decided

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:46,410
to do was make a change of reducing from full time hours to three and a half days a week.

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,390
What that meant was that two people came on board full time to replace that one and a

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,390
half days that I wasn't working.

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,670
I feel like that wasn't right.

00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,820
Maybe.

00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,100
So, zero.

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,089
It's a not a good thing when we're thinking about energy.

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:08,440
So, how do we go about what are the ways that we can move towards recharging this energy

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
bar?

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,290
Let's not maybe get to that zero point.

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:18,060
Let's see how we might be able to restock our pantries and actually is pantries a word

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,710
that's used here?

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,640
Like a cupboard with food?

00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
Yep.

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Maybe?

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Okay.

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,560
So, a pantry is like a cupboard that would exist in your kitchen that you would actually

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,050
store things like canned fruits in and yep?

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,050
Okay.

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:42,339
So, look, when that's empty, and you're going to reach in for more food and nothing's there

00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:47,260
because you haven't been restocking it, well, that's kind of the same thing with our energy

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,460
stores.

00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,630
And ways that we can recharge are actually pretty achievable.

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,470
They're all doable.

00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,990
And I'll run you through a few of these methods.

00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,100
Taking regular breaks.

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,990
Removing the noise.

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,120
Getting quality sleep.

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,450
Not working long hours.

00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,100
And working on things that are meaningful to you.

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,860
So, let's unpack these a bit further.

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,430
Because I think that they're really important and there's some really, I suppose there's

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,880
some tools out there that we can use to really help us along with this process.

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,750
So, taking regular breaks.

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,290
Yeah, sounds simple.

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,860
But it takes a lot of discipline.

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,360
It actually takes a lot of willpower to do this.

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,930
And when you're super, super busy, or there's a culture in your work place that taking breaks

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,000
is laziness or slacking off.

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,680
That's more of a struggle to do that.

00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,650
Who does actually take regular breaks?

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,650
That's wonderful.

00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,930
That's really great.

00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:58,740
Because, you know, breaks breaks can actually the science, of course.

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,440
There's a lot of studies which breaks can replenish the psychological cost with working

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,140
hard, improving work performance and boosting energy.

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:17,920
What they're actually helping do is your well, the doggo your PXE, your pre frontal cortex.

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,590
The thinking part of your brain.

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:27,510
The part that takes on the logic and executive functions, keeps you focused.

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,220
That's doing a lot.

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,690
That's the part that you're actually doing to solve a lot of the problems in your day

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,730
to day.

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:39,260
And because it's doing so much, I feel like doggo should get a break.

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,959
Let's recharge.

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,310
How can we take an effective break?

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,130
Schedule them at right times.

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,709
Know when you're really productive.

00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:58,170
And I suppose one of the saying that is fairly easy, but actually knowing when you're really

00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,550
productive and what methods you might take to go, okay, well, I'm going to go on a sprint

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,630
mode here and then take a rest here is actually it's different and individual to how, you

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,300
know, we all work individually as well.

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,579
So, that is something to I know a lot of people raised their hands but that's something that

00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:22,649
is a little bit of tweaking required so that we might recharge that chance of that overload

00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,890
that we're feeling.

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:29,300
Taking an effective break is about leaving your desk, leaving your workstation, giving

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,140
your eyes a rest.

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,320
Standing up and stretching, drinking water.

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,670
Actually, taking yourself out of that environment.

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,970
Leaving and then recharging and come back.

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:45,140
I can't begin to tell you how many times I've walked away from my desk and was able to come

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,010
back after trying to figure out something for ages and coming back and figuring out

00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,899
it was a stinking semicolon or something ridiculous like that.

00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,160
It's all it took.

00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,950
It took me a while to break out of these.

00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,920
I had this hard yakka mentality.

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,600
And taking a break, maybe I'm slacking off.

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,609
Maybe I need to push through.

00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:12,009
But that push through was really detrimental to me.

00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:17,049
So, the tools that I used for this was using my calendar.

00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:22,389
Actually, blanking out times of when I was going to design in those breaks.

00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,220
It was really important.

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,489
Because then I was taking control of that calendar and taking control of that space.

00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:31,400
Something like Slackbot reminders.

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,970
Who uses Slack here in their work?

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,970
Cool.

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,360
About 50%.

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,629
Setting up a Slack bot or whatever tool you might be using internally to have little notifications

00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:49,280
to remind yourself to stand up and stretch every now and then is really, really excellent.

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,820
I had this designed in for my team I was working with and doing that twice a day.

00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,129
We use that as an activity to get away from our desks and muster in the middle and take

00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:01,210
a stretch break.

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,100
That's only five minutes twice a day.

00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,330
It just meant we're able to have that break.

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:12,110
Who has heard of tiny care bot on Twitter?

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,110
It's adorable.

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,029
If you are on Twitter, hop along and follow it along.

00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:22,950
It's simple little gems that really just give you a little boost.

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,639
So, let's move on to the next part of topping up your energy bar.

00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,279
Removing noise.

00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:37,669
Now, when we think of working or in agile development in any sense, we want to remove

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:42,260
all that noise and have this really, you know, clear focus on what we're working on so that

00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,289
we're not distracted by everything else that's going along and not thinking about the backlog.

00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:52,259
We basically are ensuring that what we're working on is the important thing that we're

00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,379
working on and supposed to be focused on right there and then.

00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:57,649
And we can give it our 100%.

00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:04,609
So, what we want to do is remove the noise so that we're not doing a situation where

00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:10,070
when everything is important, nothing is important scenario and trying to multi task and splitting

00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,260
our focus across a few things.

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,109
So, how we want to reduce unwanted noise.

00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:20,309
Same kind of agile methodologies.

00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,639
Having calendar hygiene.

00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:25,899
And checking in on that regularly.

00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:30,419
And the calendar is something that is it's such a strong tool that you can use in your

00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,419
day to day.

00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:37,100
By taking control of it, you can blank out these areas in your day that you might be

00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,119
able to go, well, I can focus for an hour block here on this particular task.

00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:48,950
Or I can blank out this whole day to just play or learn or whatever that might be.

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,279
And it means that you can kind of continuously look at it and take out things that might

00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,239
not be relevant anymore.

00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:58,059
Maybe you don't need to go to six meetups this week.

00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:01,629
Maybe you could just choose one that you really want to focus on.

00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:04,529
Writing things down and getting them out of your head.

00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:07,309
It's I highly recommend it.

00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,029
Because when it's all swirling around up here, it's just noise.

00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:15,059
So, writing down the things that you want to achieve and what you want to do.

00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:18,409
And then going through and grooming those goals.

00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:20,379
Definitely, definitely a winner.

00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:24,479
It's something that really helps with that focus piece.

00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:29,729
Do not disturb modes are another massive one if you're going to go into a sprint.

00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:36,179
A sprint being so, you know, if you wanted to do a 20 minute session of just focus.

00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,609
And then taking away those notifications as well during those times.

00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:44,659
Or notifications when you're out of hours and after work which probably don't need to

00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,179
be pinged at all in these times.

00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:54,389
And most importantly, probably saying no is a tricky one to do.

00:20:54,389 --> 00:21:00,269
But that is all about taking control of our lives and taking control of what we're spending

00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:01,720
on what we do day to day.

00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,590
Because there's a temptation to take on a lot all the time.

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,250
But it's unnecessary.

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:15,590
So, I suggest I've suggested calendar a few times and taking control of that.

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:21,409
Head space app is a really good app for meditation and taking bringing mindfulness into the approach

00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:26,600
and that is something that you can essentially use to reduce the noise that's going along

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,639
going on in there.

00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:32,009
But it's, you know, it's a great tool if that's where you would like to head to.

00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:37,919
There's also a Slack bot called stop, breathe and think which is pretty good as well.

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,759
It brings up reminders for you.

00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,780
And has anyone used the momentum plugin?

00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,780
Kind of looks like this.

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,349
Yeah, got a couple of hands there.

00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:53,230
It's a great little Chrome and Firefox plugin that you can install, and it just gives you

00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,230
a focus mode.

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,950
So, you can just focus on one task at a time.

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,879
And then you have your other little goals that you have set up at least on the side.

00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:02,879
And, yeah.

00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:06,529
It just gives you that chance to just go, okay, I'm going to hone in on one thing and

00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:07,710
one thing only.

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,210
How great?

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,370
And that was the Slack bot that I was talking about.

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,019
Okay.

00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:18,019
On to a third way of recharging your energy bar.

00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,929
Getting sleep.

00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:23,509
What does our life look like about healthy sleep?

00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:32,850
Lack of concentration, tiredness, inability to make decisions, memory loss, lower tolerance.

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,570
It's not great.

00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,570
It's not great.

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,070
And I did actually go through a time where I was getting about four hours of sleep a

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,909
night for about three years running.

00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:43,070
Oh.

00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,710
I was able to persevere.

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,600
And that hard yakka mentality really pushed me through it.

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,420
But it really it really got me to a point where I was not starting to like what I was

00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,490
doing anymore.

00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,960
It was possibly just a bit much.

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,139
I just did not think that I could sustain this.

00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:06,559
And when we're thinking about OTS, I was getting pretty tired.

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,669
And I came across this quote.

00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:12,340
I thought it was pretty apt.

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,460
If you routinely lose sleep or choose to sleep less than needed, it adds up.

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,799
It's called your sleep dep.

00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:25,779
You have a sleep dep of 14 hours after a week.

00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:32,879
And turns out it's not something that can be paid off via naps either, sleep debt.

00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:37,129
It's a fundamental of actually being able to have a good night's sleep and be rested

00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:39,639
enough to be able to tackle the following day.

00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:45,999
There are so many resources out there about going, okay, how do we get a good night's

00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:51,549
sleep and be rested and well recovered and energized up?

00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:57,109
And look, just a few things that can get you started along the way if you're having trouble

00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:59,129
sleeping at all.

00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:08,109
Avoid looking at a device an hour before bedtime, consistent routine, avoid alcohol and caffeine

00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:14,649
six to seven hours before bed, that can be hard.

00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:15,710
And exercising.

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,809
These are simple steps that you can take towards that.

00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:28,429
And it's that first step that is the one that really takes you towards putting and prioritizing

00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:29,970
your wellness first there.

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,669
So, quickly just run you through.

00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:34,529
Yep, try these tools.

00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:44,280
Yeah, having the reoccurring reminder, the sleep cycle apps, and the sleep bot app that

00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:52,620
monitors your sleep patterns and wakes you up in a window that's not within your REM.

00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,389
And I've got two more things to go through.

00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:57,029
Don't work on hours.

00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,769
Easy to say.

00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:00,990
Little trickier to do.

00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,970
But super important.

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:08,080
There's this term that happens, I suppose, in our industry.

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,520
And actually, a lot of industries called presentism.

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,019
This is the practice of being present in one's place of work for more hours that is required,

00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:26,100
especially as a manifestation of insecurity about one's job.

00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,289
It's not it's not great.

00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:29,289
It's not great.

00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:31,929
And when we have the culture, remember, I was saying when, you know, you're hearing

00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:39,919
the praise about, oh, well, I worked 10 hours and 20 hours hey, good on you.

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:40,919
great.

00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,220
But did they actually get much done during that time?

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,749
Was that really productive?

00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:48,149
And were they able to recover from that?

00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:53,450
So, let's kind of play at the scenario of what it would look like if we were to happen

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,799
to leave on time.

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,499
Well, you would leave work on time.

00:25:57,499 --> 00:26:04,720
Look, make, who knows, improvement on time management and communication.

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,369
Because if you are leaving at the time you are supposed to be leaving, perhaps people

00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:13,340
might be more prepared to catch you before you go.

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,879
Maybe they might be more organized to say, okay, well, I really need you for X, Y, Z.

00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:21,149
Can we catch up in the window where you're available?

00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:26,240
And you might then become a better communicator of saying I'm not available from this time

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,109
onwards.

00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:30,279
Maybe catch me in a window I'm available.

00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,369
Again, taking control of that calendar again.

00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:39,330
And, I mean, it sounds pretty awful, but you get time to do the things that you really

00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,140
like to enjoy.

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,950
Or enjoy doing or that are important to you.

00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,889
Wouldn't that be a bit ace?

00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:50,960
So, here's the methods I would suggest just getting started with that.

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,460
Because it can be difficult, especially if there's a culture in your work place where

00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:00,090
people are staying back or online all the time because that's the state of our industry,

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,090
right?

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:06,330
Maybe just start by booking in a few after work appointments.

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,039
Whether that's a coffee and a cake with someone.

00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:12,320
Whether that's a walking catchup with someone else.

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,549
But having a regular routine, maybe something like a fitness group or rock climbing or whatever

00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:24,639
activity to take on that you're doing with someone else means you have that responsibility.

00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:27,460
You can go out and do it together with your buddy.

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:34,179
And committing to leaving on time is really something that is going to take a lot of discipline.

00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:39,970
And working in that habit might be a little tricky at first, but then you start to be

00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,840
okay with it.

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,830
And here's a really important one if you are working a lot of open source projects.

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:53,809
Ask your boss and create that culture within that environment that you're working in for

00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:57,139
these contributions to be happening during work hours.

00:27:57,139 --> 00:27:59,679
I think this is professional development.

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,669
I think this is the way as an employee or someone working in the industry you're growing

00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:07,059
your skills in that way.

00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:13,309
And that training should be endorsed and encouraged within work hours in some way, share, or form.

00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:17,809
So, you know, that and also if you're going to a lot of meetups, that's also training

00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:18,809
as well.

00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:24,129
Maybe balance that out, okay, if I'm going to meetup one night can I come in later the

00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:25,129
next day?

00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:27,639
That was learning time.

00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:33,149
Taking control of that more so you can spend time on things that matter.

00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:38,450
And the hard yakka side of it really comes into knowing and understanding that your time

00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,690
is precious.

00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,820
And really that's our most valuable commodity.

00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,730
So, shouldn't we be dedicating that to things that bring us joy?

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,519
Or making us more us?

00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,509
What about spending time with family and friends?

00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:56,830
What about prioritizing your interests and hobbies?

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,729
Learning and discovery, playing, travel, exploration.

00:29:01,729 --> 00:29:05,539
We're all very unique human beings that are inspired by different things.

00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:08,269
So, why not embrace that?

00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:12,609
And something that might help towards that so that you might have some more energy to

00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:16,369
contribute to it is a journal.

00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:21,789
Getting things out of your head and reflecting on it means you might have that chance to

00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:25,210
see it laid out rather than just swirling around in your mind.

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,739
Feel free to get a Pinterest or a happiness board up and running.

00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:32,940
Those visuals give you those reminders constantly.

00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,999
And deliberately booking time for play.

00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:38,719
Again, taking ownership of your calendar.

00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:47,239
So, I say, in your own way, and that energized people can do even more, and we should take

00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:50,289
care of ourselves and take care of each other.

00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:54,929
And what my grandad would say is, hard yakka is good, but don't be a dingo.

00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:55,750
