Title: Please wait... loading: a tale of two loaders - Myles Borins - JSConf EU 2018

Description: 
	Modules were first standardized in ECMAScript 6 in 2015. As of December 2017 you can now use ESModules (ESM) in 3 out of 4 of the major browsers. Node.js has traditionally shipped an implementation of Common.js (CJS), you use it in your Node.js code today via require().

There are vast differences between the two module systems that make it quite difficult to utilize Common.js code in an ESModule and vice versa. Implementing modules correctly in Node.js will have a significant impact on the future of JavaScript, the wrong decisions could fause fractures in the ecosystem. This talk will dive into some of the more nefarious edge cases and the ways the Node.js project has navigated them. The talk will also look into joint efforts with the Web platform as we attempt to make a singular pattern that can work on both the client and server.
