Lyrics
Half Time
We’re little but we’re straight up tallawah (strong)
We’re not into problem wallowers
We’re not fake like Instagram followers
Oh I’m in the flow

Fingers on the keyboard beat like drums, I say
Characters flow like rum, I say
Bugs in the system stick like gum, I say
Oh I‘m in the the flow

Call the read function on the fetcher
async/await, no callback adventure
We make fat arrows like a fletcher
Help each other with the tough stuff like a denture

We spend love like capital by venture
JSConf, every year, passes like a blur
Brown sugar, Flat White, ready to stir
Big up all the speakers ready for the lecture

Double Time
Read function on the fetcher
No callback adventure
Fat arrows, like a fletcher
Deal with the tough stuff like a denture

Spend love like capital by a venture
JSConf every year like a Blur

OMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/

[Music]

00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:36,130
hi oh wow

00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:36,130
alright yeah so hi hi everyone here

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:55,949
[Music]

00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,510
since this is jazz college I'm guessing

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,059
that most of you are JavaScript

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,059
developers people are talking about how

00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:14,329
[Music]

00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,980
so

00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:24,920
[Music]

00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:41,080
[Applause]

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:41,080
[Music]

00:01:41,580 --> 00:02:03,479
[Laughter]

00:01:45,570 --> 00:02:03,479
[Music]

00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:16,120
[Music]

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,590
[Music]

00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:50,970
the web is it's just amazing one more

00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:53,790
reason you should stick to JavaScript

00:02:50,970 --> 00:03:00,060
it's it's just a really really cool stop

00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:01,349
talking about this so this is a rock and

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,129
it rocks pretty hard

00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:10,049
in the way that rocks so I'd like to

00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:14,920
read your column nobody sits like this

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:21,550
rock you rock rock

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:27,069
throughout just sits and is you show us

00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,340
how to just sit here and that's what we

00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:34,139
need

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:34,139
[Music]

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:43,700
this is too abstract I can't use this

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:45,470
how do I make it make more sense it

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,489
doesn't make sense you see it doesn't

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,660
make sense

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:55,040
how do I make it make more sense brains

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:58,250
brains I deleted it and brain brains

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,610
obviously it does melt your brain spring

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,590
rains in the open brain brain brain

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,569
brain and I really do this in the old

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,569
days can we do stuff

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:36,860
[Music]

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:38,400
it would just jump beauties around time

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,040
of application

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,350
[Music]

00:04:42,040 --> 00:06:00,269
during the runtime of application

00:04:45,350 --> 00:06:00,269
[Music]

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:17,179
try to make a dial-up connection

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:17,179
[Music]

00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:37,009
