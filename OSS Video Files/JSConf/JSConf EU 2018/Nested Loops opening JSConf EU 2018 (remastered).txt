Lyrics
Half Time
We’re little but we’re straight up tallawah (strong)
We’re not into problem wallowers
We’re not fake like Instagram followers
Oh I’m in the flow

Fingers on the keyboard beat like drums, I say
Characters flow like rum, I say
Bugs in the system stick like gum, I say
Oh I‘m in the the flow

Call the read function on the fetcher
async/await, no callback adventure
We make fat arrows like a fletcher
Help each other with the tough stuff like a denture

We spend love like capital by venture
JSConf, every year, passes like a blur
Brown sugar, Flat White, ready to stir
Big up all the speakers ready for the lecture

Double Time
Read function on the fetcher
No callback adventure
Fat arrows, like a fletcher
Deal with the tough stuff like a denture

Spend love like capital by a venture
JSConf every year like a Blur

OMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/
