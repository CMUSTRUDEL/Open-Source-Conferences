Thank you very much.

00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:14,730
Welcome to my talk about coding kids and screaming carrots.

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,789
Just to be sure, I'm talking about kids from 6 12 years and I hope you enjoy it.

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,180
My name is Georgios Kaleadis.

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,470
I'm 34 years old.

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,849
I live in Munich and I'm a frontend developer.

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:38,890
In my spare time I teach coding to kids, and I'm origami addicted since it was taught to

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,820
me in front of Osaka castle nearly two years ago in Japan.

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:50,299
Today and nearly every day, and I created a project about virtual origami folding.

00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:52,680
So, let's start.

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,090
And first I'm going to start with me as the coding kid.

00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,740
To make sure you have the proper image, that's me.

00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,720
I'm 10 years old.

00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,960
It's 1994.

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,659
I called this, this is the holder for a reason.

00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,220
At the time I loved to play with the Super Nintendo and Sega Game Gear.

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,600
And I loved to be with the shelves of magazines.

00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:25,360
And they had them attached, and the ones with computers had applications and trials and

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
patches.

00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
Why?

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,400
Because the Internet was not available to everyone.

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,460
And could you use them?

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,460
Not at all.

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,470
I didn't own a computer.

00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,979
I got in touch with real computers when my sister took me to an agency office.

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:45,420
And I got to tinker around with a Mac OS9.

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,560
Photoshop was my favorite application.

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,780
I created dozens of galaxy spirals.

00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:56,270
And jump to 1997, the year of my first PC.

00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,890
Actually, I had to wait until Christmas 1997.

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,000
It's now three years since my first magazine.

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,590
My computer is running Windows 95 and had a 4-gigabyte hard disk.

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,370
And what does a kid do with a brand-new computer?

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,370
Playing games.

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,950
It's 1998 and I enjoyed my computer day and night.

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,950
My very first game I bought was Blade runner.

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,930
It was distributed and took up half of my disk space.

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,810
Let's go ahead to 1999.

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,180
The year I got my Internet access.

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:41,100
I had a 56K modem to connect, which was slower than your frontal data plan on your smartphone.

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,849
Let's listen to the iconic sound for a quick flashback.

00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:53,820
If I can get sound.

00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:00,989
[modem sounds ahhh... memories...]

00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,580
[ Applause ] Yeah.

00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:17,150
And I still can't believe that the Internet worked back then.

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,190
This is some random day in April 1999.

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,200
I was watching my favorite TV station called NBC Giga.

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,100
They usually talked about games and computers all day long.

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,739
This particular day they were showing us a brand-new application for creating animations.

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,060
They let a red ball bounce around.

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,370
It must have looked like this.

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,660
And I was impressed.

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:47,160
They mentioned the name of the application, but I didn't write it down.

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,879
After school I wanted to search for the version on all of my magazines.

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,459
But I forgot the name.

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:56,530
The week went by quickly.

00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,530
It is Saturday.

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,620
Which means getting up as early as possible and watching series like Saber Rider, Captain

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,710
Future or Duck Tales.

00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,170
And around lunchtime, watched Giga TV again.

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,590
I could not believe it, it was repeated from earlier in the week.

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:19,430
I was frozen and held my breath and waited for the moment they would tell met name I

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,430
forgot.

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,680
And then there it was on the TV screen.

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,750
It was called Macromedia Flash 4.

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:36,060
And just now, with Flash, this was the genesis of my whole programming career.

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,490
Flash looks like this.

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,229
There's a timeline, some layers and tools.

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:43,139
And, of course, the stage where things move around.

00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,190
I quickly found a place to code.

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,000
And soon I was able to program the very famous menu.

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,340
It's a horizontal navigation with the illusion of infinity.

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,340
And I was so good at programming that thing that I could go to agencies to earn my first

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,000
money.

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,870
It was an amazing time full of amazing websites.

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,500
You see here the portal.

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,290
Yes, this is a website.

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,610
And stuff like this drove my ambition to get me where I am today.

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,419
So, what's my point, you are asking?

00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:19,750
Well, remember the genesis of my programming career in front of the TV?

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:25,210
I wish I would have had some guidance during school so that more than a single moment in

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,530
front of the TV would have guided me to my career.

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,810
That's the most I had in school, this.

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,470
Later, computer classes were like this.

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:49,050
And computer classes today are [audio breaking up] I want to be and change the things.

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,000
That's why I began teaching coding in my spare time.

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,020
And I wanted to teach how you can contribute to.

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:03,460
So, for the next 20 minutes I will talk about how to teach and where to teach it.

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,830
So, why do for kids let's start with something easy.

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,889
We all can describe to a child how is more or less, right?

00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:19,240
We can even tell how it works.

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,880
But when you press a play button on a video, yeah.

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,670
What would you tell that kid?

00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,240
It's hard for many of us.

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,940
It's like something is missing in school.

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,009
So, let's fix this for our children by teaching coding to kids.

00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,610
The whole world is talking like that.

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:42,199
It's like people are concerned about the future of our kids or that we fear that technology

00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,509
leaves us behind.

00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,850
But no matter what, the command is the same.

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,449
Our kids should learn coding.

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,949
This is justified.

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,990
I'm biased in this question for obvious reasons.

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,660
So, let's step back and take a look at the bigger picture.

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,810
We start by looking at the mechanic and apply the whole coding discussion on to it.

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,830
And it goes like this.

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,800
It's sort of like an obsession with being an auto mechanic.

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,370
There's tons of cars and there's tons of driving.

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,370
But I think it's a little silly and go and say that everyone should really learn to be

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:23,230
an auto mechanic just because cars are so essential to the functioning of our society.

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,230
Yeah.

00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,290
It would be silly, indeed.

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,190
But what do we do?

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,270
There's tons of technology and we go around and tell everybody how important coding is.

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,530
So, are we silly, then?

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,509
Or are we just talking about something else than coding?

00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,289
What if the word "Coding" is born out of confusion?

00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:46,690
The question is, what do people actually mean with coding?

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:54,130
In 1943 Konrad Zuse built the famous Plankalkul and together with it, the very first programming

00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,130
language.

00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,300
It looked like this.

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,449
And the technology escalated pretty quickly.

00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:07,460
With this, you hold the device that combines everything we learned in the past 70 years.

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,259
That's a lot of very complex.

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,949
It makes computer science not easy to talk about.

00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:19,370
Coding on the other side is easy, take someone at the keyboard and watch that person give

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,330
commands to the computer.

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,580
That's coding and people understand it.

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,800
If coding is such an easy word, maybe that's why it's mixed up.

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,469
Let's try a theory, when people talk about coding, they actually mean technology.

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,990
And people demand our kids not to learn coding.

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,769
They're saying our kids need to learn technology.

00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:45,389
And the whole coding discussion suddenly makes sense.

00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:47,329
It's not about coding anymore.

00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:51,569
It's about exposure to technology, computer science and programming.

00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:56,070
So, kids can understand the bigger picture and the connecting lines.

00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,319
Most of the kids will never be a coder anyway.

00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:04,010
Our children should learn that smartphones and technology are not magical.

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,509
That there are limitations, benefits and possibilities for using them.

00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:11,500
Teaching coding still makes sense.

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,249
It's only one part of understanding technology.

00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:18,029
But you benefit in many ways when you learn to code.

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:23,989
As a coder, you make the transition from being a consumer to a producer who can tell stories

00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:27,259
and create your own worlds in the computer.

00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,769
Coding stretches your mind.

00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:33,300
And it creates a thinking which is useful in depends.

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:40,170
The room for creativity is endless like painting and music, but often more accessible and affordable.

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,970
And speaking of affordable, coding gives you chances.

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:50,970
Computers are cheap nowadays, poor children can afford it.

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,429
Everybody can become a coder today.

00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:58,920
So, I hope I've convinced you by now why teaching coding matters.

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,410
Let me show you some possibilities how to teach coding.

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:09,160
I will present you now a list of my favorite tools I love to use when teaching.

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,709
It's about tinkering, robots and actual coding.

00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:14,709
Let's have a look at tinkering.

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:19,179
This is all about playing around with electronics.

00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,790
For example, with a robot.

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,499
This is a toy that every kid starting at 4 years can build by themselves.

00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:29,660
The parts cost less than 2 Euros.

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,299
There's a battery and a rotating motor.

00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:41,009
When activated, the robot will vibrate and start walking around drawing on the underlying

00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,009
surface.

00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:47,269
This looks like real art in the end, and it's so much fun for the kids to watch their robot

00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:48,489
to be alive.

00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:53,040
And making it, its simplicity is just awesome.

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,980
The MakeyMakey is a board that presents to be a computer keyboard.

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:06,610
When they get close, they close a circuit on the MakeyMakey and you press a defined

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,290
code on the computer.

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,749
What can you do?

00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:13,899
Build a Super Mario controller.

00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,980
Find a Mario game that you can control with the keyboard.

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:27,540
And you can be productive and design your own game controller to move and jump.

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,199
Our next tool, robots.

00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:34,209
Many of them can be programmed with the child friendly programming language.

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:37,389
Let me show you some.

00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,319
Say hello to Dash & Dot.

00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:43,499
Those are robots with many censors, LSDs and speakers.

00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:45,639
Together they cost around 200 Euros.

00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:52,980
And to play with them, you can use it so that everything is about exploring and adventures.

00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:00,279
You don't create programs, but have missions by using commands for light, sound and movement.

00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,359
This also is where you have more of a coding experience.

00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:08,509
This gives the kid a focus on their own creativity with the robots.

00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:11,910
And my favorite robot.

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,639
He's open source.

00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,959
You can theoretically create all parts yourself and use the software for free.

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,489
You can, of course, buy it as a package for 80 Euros.

00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:27,519
And what's special about it?

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,619
That the kid will assemble it.

00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:31,570
Usually within 20 minutes.

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:37,779
You can then start an automatic program, use an app or code your own program.

00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:45,059
When you activate the autonomous driving mode, it uses the sensor to follow a line and avoid

00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:50,420
obstacles in front of it.

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,860
Let's look at how coding is being taught.

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,399
You usually tackle it in three different parts.

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,429
Analog activity, playing games, and dive into the actual coding experience.

00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:04,470
Let's look at the analog activity.

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,759
If you want to control a robot, you have to behave like a robot first.

00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,069
So, it's playing the human robot game.

00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:15,250
One kid all year dresses up as a robot.

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:21,239
A helmet is usually enough for the illusion, but the full costume like this is never wrong.

00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:28,109
You explain the kids around that they can only use five commands to control the robot.

00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:32,739
Forward, turn left, turn right, backward and stop.

00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:34,730
So, let's begin.

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,389
Imagine this task.

00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:39,529
You want the robot to turn to the right and walk in that direction.

00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:43,639
So, you begin with a turn right, right?

00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:49,240
Let's see what happens after the kids yelled that command to the robot.

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,549
The robot will spin forever and ever and ever, of course.

00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:56,829
The command was correct, but not exact enough.

00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:00,439
They should have said turn right for a quarter.

00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:07,369
While spinning around, somebody will hopefully scream a releasing step to the desperate robot.

00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:09,799
In the end, kids really love that game.

00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,129
Collaborate and understand the limits of a machine.

00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:19,759
They also understand the requirement of exact commands and to put one command after another

00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,980
just like in programming.

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,050
Your crowd is ready for some more fun.

00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,609
Let's play some coding games.

00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:30,419
There's some rules in our Hour of Code to do so.

00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:38,109
There are dozens of one-hour games and tutorials translated in over 45 languages.

00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:40,860
Everybody's encouraged to try it.

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:47,059
The games are themed after kid's games like Princess Elsa or Minecraft.

00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,649
And they teach the principles of programming while playing.

00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:56,629
I usually pick a game to follow up with the human robot example.

00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:06,249
This is a level where he has to be guided to his favorite food, the level, and it's

00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:07,660
a flower.

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:15,299
And you move with simple demands, move forward, turn left, right.

00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:18,529
Kids usually place one command after the other.

00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:20,679
That's simple and it's working.

00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:23,029
But it results in a huge list.

00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:30,329
They can't even complete the level as they're forced to use a new block to repeat commands.

00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:37,489
I then show them a pattern of four blocks they can repeat instead of the huge list.

00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:40,499
Forward, left, forward, right.

00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:43,470
And I point them to the pink repeating block.

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,790
And, success!

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,059
They usually just know what to do.

00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:52,240
Pick the pink loop block and repeat the repeating pattern inside.

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,220
It's now a small and beautiful block of code.

00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,959
I love this moment.

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,350
I explain this is what it computer is for.

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,540
The computer should repeat the boring stuff.

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,879
It is not your task.

00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:12,399
After the hour, the kids should have internalized those block based commands and they are ready

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,100
for Scratch to do some real coding.

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,949
Scratch is the most famous tool in kid programming.

00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:22,269
It was created by Mr. Resnick at MIT in 2002.

00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:27,279
It can be used with Flash.

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:34,189
The next, version 3 is based on HTML 5 and will be released in August.

00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:38,970
Everything you code can be shared on the Scratch website and remixed by others as the source

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,220
code is always accessible.

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,199
Let's have a look inside Scratch.

00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:47,819
On the left you have a stage where everything will move around.

00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:50,619
And on the right, you see the coding theater.

00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:53,479
That's where you code with colorful blocks.

00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:59,859
This is called block based programming and very easy to understand by children.

00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:05,179
And to complete a section, I brought you something special.

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:10,230
A screaming carrot, which is also part of the sensational title.

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,279
It's programmed in Scratch and it will make use of a MakeyMakey.

00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:20,839
So, I will switch over to my application.

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:31,610
Let's try it if this is working.

00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,150
yeah.

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,720
I will align myself.

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Yeah.

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,539
This is setup I prepared.

00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:48,419
And you will see momentarily what I've prepared here because I am going to switch over into

00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,510
webcam mode.

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,889
So, that's me.

00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:59,610
And you should see now the hardware I've prepared.

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,600
The people in front should have problems, the resolution is low.

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,630
I will explain it so you can fill the rest of the image.

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:16,549
So, what you can see here is first of all, a kitchen knife made of steel.

00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:17,730
That's important.

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,270
The mandatory carrot.

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,520
You can see here two connecting cables.

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,760
They're called alligator clips.

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,950
And they are titled because they are looking like an alligator.

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,259
And you have here the MakeyMakey.

00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:35,350
I hope you can see it now.

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,190
It's this board.

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,610
And you can see some contact points.

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,299
You see some labeled with space or just arrow keys mimicking the once on your keyboard.

00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:48,860
And at the bottom, you see what is required to close the circuit.

00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,660
Let's use all that stuff.

00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:57,360
Use the space key to connect it.

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,900
I will plug it into the carrot.

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:09,320
I will use the green to connect to the grounding bar.

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,240
And I will plug it into the knife.

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,649
And what happens now is, when I touch the carrot, I will align it here if I touch the

00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:21,919
carrot, it will flow through the orange cable into the carrot.

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,140
And back to the MakeyMakey, and the MakeyMakey will tell the computer, hey, the space key

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,279
is pressed, and you can do fantastic stuff with this.

00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:34,370
I will connect it and show you what it's doing at the moment.

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,480
You will see it heavily blink.

00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Which is a good sign.

00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Yep.

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,600
And if I attach it, you should see in the lower right corner, space key pressed.

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,900
That's boring because I promised you something even cooler.

00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,509
So, let's do a quick live coding session.

00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,769
Yeah.

00:19:55,769 --> 00:20:02,200
[ Applause ] So, that's pretty hard, over my shoulder.

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,659
But I will get there because I'm prepared.

00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:11,129
So, this is the part which is showing the issue.

00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:15,059
And I will replace it with the sound I prepared.

00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,639
Its code name is same sound.

00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:18,440
And I plug it here.

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,550
And you can read it there, when space key is pressed, play some sound until done.

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:31,820
So, let's see what's happen for I'm going back into full screen mode.

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,309
I will show you the carrot.

00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:35,309
Not.

00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:40,309
It's coming my way.

00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:41,490
Always failing.

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,490
Okay.

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,820
So, let's try it to cut a carrot.

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:56,769
I mean, it's a pretty big one.

00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:12,080
[carrot screaming] [ Applause ]

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,880
And I promise I will eat that carrot just to save the moment.

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,980
So, let's get back into the presentation.

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,299
Okay.

00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:30,400
What's left is the question where everybody could try teaching coding.

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,830
I want to stress the word everybody.

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,210
You don't have to be a programmer.

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,820
Everybody can learn coding, and everybody can teach about coding or robots.

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:46,570
I started teaching coding to kids in my spare time exactly one and a half years ago.

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:53,120
They started in Berlin in 2016 and opened an office in Munich in 2017.

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,730
This schedule is about coding with Scratch, robotics, motion, and exploring the worlds

00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,730
of Minecraft.

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,529
If you want to try it, just go like I did.

00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:09,850
And you can host an Hour of Code even where you play games like the zombie game and explain

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,269
programming to interested people.

00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:16,480
And you may find an Hour of Code in your home town.

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,779
Try to join and get in touch with the organizers.

00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:22,049
And don't forget your family at home.

00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:27,929
You can start teaching your own kids and relatives easily with the tools I've shown you.

00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:33,400
And you won't believe it, but designers, project managers or maybe your clients are eager to

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,190
learn coding too.

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:42,309
They will have fun and understand you better the next time you talk about bits and bytes.

00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:43,309
Okay.

00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,659
Enough about how, why and where to teach coding.

00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:49,259
There's another important thing we didn't talk about yet.

00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:52,610
What about me, the teach center what do I get?

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,779
Well, when did you play with toys for no reason the last time?

00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:00,500
It's healthy and it relaxes your mind.

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,990
It literally entertains the kid inside you.

00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,620
And teaching coding makes not only the kids, but you creative.

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:13,030
You need to think about what to do with a MakeyMakey or create coding challenges in

00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,309
Scratch.

00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:20,620
Maybe you will use Scratch by yourself to surprise someone special on their birthday.

00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,740
If you are a coder, did you ever try to explain someone programming?

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,840
Yes, it's very difficult.

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,909
You have to reflect on the very, very basics of programming again.

00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:36,789
But once you've mastered this, it will help you throughout your whole mentoring career.

00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,620
And working with kids is fun.

00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:44,539
I always had an amazing time and I'm still surprised about all the funny ideas they have.

00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:48,399
You are full of knowledge now.

00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:49,399
Use it.

00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:52,679
A quick recap of what I've told you.

00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,649
Coding mentors because it was never about coding only.

00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:00,350
But being exposed to technology, computer science and programming.

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:06,010
So, kids can see the bigger picture and the connecting lines between technologies.

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,059
But coding still makes sense.

00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:09,870
Computers don't care who you are.

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,029
And many can afford it.

00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:17,750
And coding boosts your creativity and is useful in all demands.

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,990
And you know how to do it too.

00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:25,720
By building robots and using a MakeyMakey to make carrots scream, for example.

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:33,249
You know there are robots for kids like Dash & Dot and they are easily programmable.

00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:39,650
And finally, let the kids play the human robot game followed by the zombie to prepare them

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,279
for coding in scratch where they unleash their creativity.

00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:51,330
And you know you can teach at the place you started with locations around Germany, or

00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:55,769
you decide to host or join an Hour of Code event.

00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:01,999
And you can start using your family at home or make your office happy by teaching people

00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:04,570
a bit about coding.

00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,990
And there's one last thing I want to tell.

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,750
I still remember my very first time I taught kids.

00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:16,400
The glowing in their eyes when they connected the pieces and finally understood what I teach

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
them.

00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,049
And this is why I stand in front of you today and I want you to experience the same and

00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,210
have some kids finding their way through technology.

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,190
You can kind the slides and the link list on this URL.

00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,190
Thanks lot for listening.

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,191
