Title: Hey you, do you even design ? - Florence Okoye - JSConf EU 2018
Publication date: 2018-07-17
Playlist: JSConf EU 2018
Description: 
	How do we move beyond designing and building ever more myopic services that barely improve on our competitors and still find it a continual struggle to provide real value to users? For all our conversations about empathy driven and user centred design, what’s missing in the way we build the web for the very persons we’re meant to be empathising with and why? What can we do about it?

It’s time to bring a bit of critical theory into our solution architecture and look at ways our concern for ethics, sustainability, access and social impact can intersect with our code. Combining insights from design thinking and intersectional analysis, this talk will look both at how misconstrued design fails and endangers users at all levels and what it should really mean to design for the modern web.
