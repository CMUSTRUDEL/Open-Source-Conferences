Title: Hey you, do you even design ? - Florence Okoye - JSConf EU 2018
Publication date: 2018-07-17
Playlist: JSConf EU 2018
Description: 
	How do we move beyond designing and building ever more myopic services that barely improve on our competitors and still find it a continual struggle to provide real value to users? For all our conversations about empathy driven and user centred design, what’s missing in the way we build the web for the very persons we’re meant to be empathising with and why? What can we do about it?

It’s time to bring a bit of critical theory into our solution architecture and look at ways our concern for ethics, sustainability, access and social impact can intersect with our code. Combining insights from design thinking and intersectional analysis, this talk will look both at how misconstrued design fails and endangers users at all levels and what it should really mean to design for the modern web.

Hi, everyone.

00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,310
So, I am wondering how to start this talk off, and I was advised that it's always best

00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:25,599
to start off from a place of truth, so, in that spirit of honesty, I guess I will start

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,539
off with my truth.

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:34,450
That is that, sometimes, well, to be honest, a lot of times, when it comes to the web,

00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,520
I actually have no idea what it is that we are doing.

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,740
I have no idea it is we think we're doing.

00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:48,330
Those moments of confusion tend to hit me both as a designer and a user alike before

00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:54,860
as a user, I find myself often confronted with in wide array of products, most of which

00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:01,130
are practically interchangeable, and neither of them really make much difference to the

00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,850
core task I've been trying to do with them.

00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:10,990
And often, even when I do subscribe to any of these products, any of these services,

00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:18,070
I find myself quite literally afflicted by upgrades, and changes that are poorly communicated,

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:23,530
and, quite frankly, don't seem to have any real benefit to myself, and are definitely

00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,050
an example of feature-creep.

00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:33,140
Which concerns me as a designer, because, certainly, on the local level, there's obviously

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,280
the impact on the users' direct experience, when we think about loading times — and

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,180
I'm also particularly concerned that these plethora of services often aren't much more

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,700
usable than the other.

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,460
They're certainly not particularly accessible, especially when you consider, in the context

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,280
of the EU, we have about 26 per cent of EU citizens who self-report that they live with

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,979
some form of disability, and, certainly, these products aren't any more ethical, which, again,

00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:11,230
is a massive concern, especially when you're considering whether that is in terms of the

00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:18,010
amount of time and attention they demand from the user to the security of the users' information,

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,350
even just to how they communicate what is connected by using the service, where the

00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,540
data is coming from and where the data is going.

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,360
When you put that in terms of the global context, you know, when you think of all these products

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,780
and services, which are taking up reams of service space, which has a huge environmental

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:44,650
cost, if you think of the 70 million servers that contribute 2 per cent to all greenhouse

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,130
emissions, not to speak of the impact of the production life cycle of the hardware on our

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:58,310
environmental, biological ecosystems, as well as the poorest of the global population, and,

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:07,090
so, in that spirit of fascination and confusion — fascination because, like many of us here,

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,460
I am someone who is generally excited and interested, and fascinated by technologies

00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:21,400
— and I really want to take this opportunity to slightly provoke us as a community, and

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,800
start asking ourselves firstly what are we actually doing here?

00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,810
And really to get into how are we doing it?

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:38,069
So, yes, I'm sorry, but it's that time of the day, and what we're going to talk about

00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,110
is design.

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:45,280
A bit of content warning: the next slide has some geometric black and white animations,

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,360
but hopefully, I won't linger on that too long.

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,400
So, design.

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,420
What is design?

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:02,959
For me in the context of this talk, I'm fundamentally talking about problem-solving.

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,960
When I talk about design and implicitly designers, I'm talking about those of us who are creating

00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:16,160
something with an intent, so I'm not speaking to those of us who are backend engineers as

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,469
I am for those who are API developers and user interface designers.

00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:29,690
To quote, "If you're someone who moves things from an existing condition to a preferred

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,990
one, you are a designer."

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:41,509
And so, if to design is to provoke movement, questions arise such as where are we moving

00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:42,930
to?

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,979
What are we moving from?

00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:49,999
And perhaps, more importantly, what is it that we are actually moving?

00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:55,680
If we look at this ecosystem, if we think about the things we're trying to move, one

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,499
of the most obvious things is people.

00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:04,340
We're trying to move modes of behaviour, ways of understanding.

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,680
These are all conditions that we may well either be asked by our product owners, by

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,870
ideators or innovators to change, or they may well be, that we ourselves wish to move.

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:23,439
Often, when we start to understand where people are in order to understand how we could potentially

00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:30,050
shift their behaviours and their ways of thinking, we tend to map out their experiences in this

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,050
particular way.

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,529
We tend to this about what they think and what they feel, what they say, and what they

00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:39,979
hear, what they say, and what he they to.

00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:48,749
By doing so, we are trying to get a sense of the complexity of the person who will be

00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,699
using our services and our technology.

00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:56,699
And I say "complexity", and there is, in fact, a clue in the way I phrase the segments of

00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:02,399
the map, because, often in reality, what we find, is that this is riddled with paradoxes.

00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,490
There are paradoxes between the way people think and how they feel, between what they

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,680
say and what they actually do.

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,520
Between the things they think they see or observe, and the things that they actually

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,610
act on and take note of.

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:24,050
So here we have one way of trying to understand the humans that we as designers are trying

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,050
to influence.

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:31,460
But already, there's a major pitfall that we are all susceptible to, and I suspect,

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:37,509
given that there are fascinatingly confusing state of things, we all too frequently give

00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:39,379
into.

00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:49,789
Ultimately, what happens, is that we tend to limit the way we are mapping our users

00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:53,419
the way we imagine and understand our users.

00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:57,550
Too much in terms of the problem that we think we're trying to solve.

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,509
Ultimately, what that means is that we are inadequately framing the person who we think

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:09,369
we are trying to serve, and ultimately, this is the source of the problem.

00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:15,759
Inadequate framing of the person leads to an inaccurate framing of the problem.

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:22,059
Ultimately, understanding people is meant to help us frames problems better to generate

00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:24,029
better outcomes.

00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:28,599
To quote: "It's easy to make bad choices when there

00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:35,430
aren't many choices to begin with," and that is impacted by our inadequate framing of the

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,639
person.

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:43,059
Because, ultimately, if the problem we think we are trying to solve is all there is to

00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:47,699
life, the universe, and everything, well, hang on, no, because it isn't.

00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:55,779
Ultimately, it if our job is to move things into a preferred condition, it's vital to

00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:02,029
understand the current condition, because humans don't just exist in relation to the

00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:04,139
problems that we think we are trying to solve.

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:12,650
In fact, as humans, we exist in relation to many other interfering mental and social models.

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:22,199
We exist in relation to many other environments, natural, social, and built.

00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,639
One of those built objects, one of those built environments, is the other object that we

00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:34,230
are trying to move over to a preferred condition, and that other object is the web.

00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:41,850
Now, at its most basic, the web is created by a computational devices communicating with

00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,520
each other by an agreed protocol.

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,680
But I'm often being quite curious, because if you think about the map we use to try to

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,700
interrogate the experience of the human, what happens if we try to use that same map to

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,670
understand the experience of the web?

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,910
Often, what happens is that, in many ways, we see that the same paradoxes apply.

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:13,560
Formula the internet is created of communications between computers, sending bits of information

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,520
between each other, yet, this information, regardless of the fact that it is broken down

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,420
into its binary components, is nonetheless combined with the physical structure of the

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:32,840
network, the physical structure that actually arises out of already existing evolving geopolitical

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,710
and economic infrastructures.

00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:41,430
It's that which contributes to fundamental inequalities, as to which languages with more

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:47,520
dominant, who has access to the web in the first place, when they do, and how.

00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,590
So, to clarify, what is going on is that the inequalities we see on the web scheme from

00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,880
the material nature of the web.

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,930
These inequalities that impact what people get to read, see, how secure their data might

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:09,450
be, and indeed how safe they might be as a citizen of their country.

00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,960
And it's the materiality of the web which is where, as designers, our concern for the

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,050
environmental impact of the web should also come in.

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,620
After all, all those servers are what helps to contribute to the fact that the web is

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:38,830
the fourth largest producer of C02 after the United States, China, and India.

00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:46,090
What you have is an object made up of the relationship between the human and the web,

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:52,970
or our solution, the things that transmits movement to the system to move this relationship

00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:58,670
to a different way of being, actually becomes a part of the system.

00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,510
Ultimately, the intersection of the web, the user, and whatever additional dynamics we

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:13,060
create will create in turn another emergent system, and, like all emergent systems, it

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,930
is complex in nature.

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:24,200
It is chaotic, and unpredictable, arises into huge and often un seen phase shifts.

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,620
Sometimes, it's often what results in cases like this.

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,230
So this is a screen shot from a developer, Jackie Arsino, who is one of who noticed that

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:46,320
the fact that the facial recognition software that Google had put in place was incapable

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,760
of realising that black people were, in fact, human beings, and, instead, categorised them

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,480
as gorillas.

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,420
I always point to this example, partly because it is pretty famous, and most people have

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:04,920
at least heard an inkling of it, but I think in terms of what I'm trying to talk about,

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,900
in terms of designing for this human and web system, it highlights some of the key assumptions

00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,250
that we tend to infect our solutions with.

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,320
It highlights assumptions about what aspects of the human need to be taken into consideration,

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,370
and particularly in the case of this example, my lights our assumptions about our ability

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:36,520
to manage and solve any resultant errors in the service we think we are providing.

00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,530
Seeing this kind of stuff is fascinating for me as a user-experience designer, because

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,600
it is enough to make anyone cry.

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,480
Do you even design!

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:54,000
A lot of what is happening is that we are too busy framing our design research into

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,030
how it directly applies to the problem we want to solve.

00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:03,590
We're ignoring the noise because it doesn't seem to be relevant.

00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:08,450
If this is something I myself am totally susceptible to.

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:14,500
I'm from the UK, a society that is still massively riven by class and racial inequalities, and

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,280
even I sometimes will fall prey to this.

00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:24,360
I have to remember that myself, as a middle class cis-gendered university educated abled

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,990
citizen of a first-world Anglophone nation, that so much of what I might perceive as just

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:38,410
additional and extra bits of information essentially, the noise in my research data, is not, in

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,410
fact, noise.

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:47,800
Who is going on is simply my relative privilege impeding my ability to interpret the data.

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,550
It's not noise.

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,220
It's just your privilege talking.

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,810
The designed object, after all, is a revelatory object.

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:05,010
It reveals our assumptions about people, our assumptions about how we think the world works,

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,350
or, indeed, how we think it doesn't.

00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:14,470
It certainly isn't neutral, and, as a child of humanity, technology can never be neutral.

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,250
So, when we are designing things that will be used by people, we need to check how we

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,100
think about people, and how we think about the world.

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,250
We all, after all, have multiple facets to ourselves as to how we are seen by society.

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:38,310
The work of Kimblely Crenshaw, who invented the word "intersectionality", with , that

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:46,390
work came out of rigorous analysis about how legislation in the United States at the time

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:53,420
couldn't fully account for the discriminatory experience faced by black women in the workplace.

00:14:53,420 --> 00:15:00,690
As people who were both black and women, the legal system couldn't adequately frame their

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,800
experience being a combination of sexism and racism.

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,180
And so, similarly, like that legal system, our technologies may not be able to adequately

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:20,120
frame the experiences of our users and could, as a result, put them at risk from the inequality

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,340
that they already interface with in their society, and, in fact, that our technologies

00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,180
will in turn interface and being be impacted by.

00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,610
It's not noise.

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,720
It's just your privilege talking.

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,180
So, I promised that this would also have something a bit practical.

00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:45,120
I guess now, the most obvious question is: well, hey, you, teaching us how to design,

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,720
what can we try instead?

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:57,279
What I always like to say is first off start by reaching out and opening up.

00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,390
Reach out.

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,050
Get your technology looked at.

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,690
Get your technology considered from a different perspective.

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:13,100
If you're living in a university city, or nearby a research institute, find out who

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,540
your local digital humanities academics are.

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,160
Get in touch with ethnographers and social historians who will have experience in analysing

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:30,310
hundreds of years worth of data concerning human behaviour and the interaction with technology.

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:36,630
If your city has an impact hub, or a maker space, reach out to them, and get them involved

00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:42,480
in critiquing, with ideating and testing the solutions and your technology that might help

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,050
them.

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,070
Working in machine-learning?

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:54,390
Join the Algorithmic Justice League to raise concerns that you might have about how well

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:59,130
the data set has been formulated.

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:04,519
If you're already in development phase or thinking about pushing upgrades, use gamified

00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:10,529
interventions like the Tarot Card of Tech to help you design and improve architecture

00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:17,379
flexible enough to handle the various situations that even a single persona can find themselves

00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:18,980
in.

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:25,069
Even if it is almost too late to which those changes to your ways of working, at the very

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:31,590
least, it help you be honest about where the potential security and social risks for users

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,059
will be.

00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:40,419
The next tip is to design your technology as a service.

00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:42,110
What a does that mean?

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:49,559
What it means, to paraphrase the service design network, is that think about how you're designing

00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,840
the infrastructure, the communication between the different levels of your systems, and

00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,370
the material components of the service will interact not just with the people who are

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,289
using the service, but also with the service provider.

00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:12,320
Your solution is in 19 ways a go-between between two already existing complex systems.

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,299
Design the whole life cycle; design what happens if it breaks or degrades; design how people

00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,330
will deal with it if they have issues with it, what happens if the user dies.

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,179
What happens to their data then?

00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:26,740
Design, design.

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,659
Think about this.

00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:34,539
The other thing that might also be helpful as a fun little exercise: actually map out

00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:39,669
the experience of your solution as though it were a person — and I'm honestly not

00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,879
trying to be cute.

00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:46,080
Actually pin down how is it that your solution thinks?

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,090
How does it feel?

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,360
What does it think about its users?

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,009
What is the mental model of your technology?

00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,350
What can it understand about people?

00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,749
Are they just first and last name?

00:18:58,749 --> 00:18:59,799
Do they usual social media.

00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:07,690
Do they see what other things the user transmits across the vast ecosystem of the web?

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:16,299
What does your technology see and hear from other services and other technologies?

00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:23,759
Most importantly, I would advise you to remember, and to understand the person, the human being,

00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,960
as multi-dimensional, and, remember that complexity in any complex system comes from the most

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,159
basic component: the variations that exist within that system are often what lead to

00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,240
wide divergences in behaviours and phases.

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:46,890
And then, for us, as designers of the web, that complexity comes from the human.

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,190
So, think.

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,980
How their context informs even their non-task related needs.

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,990
Is it always safe for them to use social media logins to gain access to your service.

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:06,119
If they have done, can they, and are they empowered to change what information is displayed?

00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:12,570
One of the things that always frankly annoys me quite significantly is if I'm using — logging

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:18,539
into a solution, and I can, for example, use my Twitter handle to log in — and yet I

00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,649
can't change the image.

00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:24,730
I can't change it into, say, a generic avatar in case I don't want people to realise it

00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:31,250
is the same person on Twitter and meet-up or wherever else using this particular product.

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,379
So, what other issues?

00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:39,710
How do they report if something goes wrong with the solution, either in terms of the

00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:45,950
other users they're encountering, or with the solution itself in can you build this

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,090
at scale?

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,929
Always consider how your solution will be used in the context of the other.

00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:56,450
Someone as different from you as possible.

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,520
Consider how your tech might be used by, or impact someone, who was homeless, someone

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,289
who was a refugee, someone who is a woman, someone who is trans, someone with varying

00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:11,280
power supply in their local context.

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,029
If it seems tokenistic, well, to be honest, that says more about your technology than

00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:19,130
the design process.

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:25,999
If considering the multiplicity of human experience comes across as tokenistic, quite, frankly,

00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:31,530
that's because your technology is already objectifying people, so check yourself: do

00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,320
people actually need the service that you think you're providing?

00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,809
If you're truly convinced that people do, then I'm afraid you need to be ready to get

00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:46,789
uncomfortable and start engaging with the realities of human existence.

00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:52,470
A really great way, then, to account for this complexity is what often gets called design-jamming,

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:58,549
and, you know, the famous saying how it goes: if you can't beat 'em, involve 'em.

00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:08,289
Even before acceptance testing, get co-creating with your users, testers, and auditors.

00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:12,350
What you will end up with are technologies that are much more resilient and have a more

00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:17,799
durable end-to-end service, because, instead of having to react to the complexity once

00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:23,379
they're out there in the ecosystem, they have already have imbibed that complexity as part

00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:27,169
of the basic architecture of the product.

00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:31,419
If you need help — and you may well do, and that's fine — there's a huge service

00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:38,889
design network out there filled with friendly and excited designers who are itching to help

00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:48,070
you design the technologies of the future which is be human-centred, ethical, and accessible.

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:56,289
By 2020, it's estimated there will be 200 billion connected devices, changing zeta bytes'

00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:58,340
worth of data.

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:04,570
Yet, if the foundational technologies that allow us to analyse and extract a value from

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:11,720
this data to create our products, if those foundation al technologies are built in hope

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,980
rather than on the evidence about our intersectional realities, that means we create an ever greater

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:26,309
pile-up of digital gunk that no-one really needs, increases our environmental deficit,

00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:32,850
and puts us all at increased risk from cyber and socio-political attacks.

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,600
I implore you, therefore, as a fellow designer.

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,580
Think broader than your problem.

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,710
Think broader than your screens.

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,799
Think broader than your personas.

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,989
Think broader than your neat little plugins.

00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,409
Think broader.

00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:50,710
Make inclusively, and start designing better.

00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,710
Thank you.

00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,619
