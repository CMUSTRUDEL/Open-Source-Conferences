[Music]

00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:15,680
my talk was called Haiti even design and

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:18,140
how we design for the web how we design

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,680
for people in an inclusive and

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,750
intersectional way have fun and that the

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,750
web can do any kind of nonsense how we

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,130
can improve programming a communication

00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,560
thinking better about language my

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,530
journey of chatting gears levers in my

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,740
city burning bright but not bearing out

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,619
errors and error handling and ways to be

[Music]

00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:14,430
I applied for a scholarship I want to

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,130
get this experience and try to get it to

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,850
my own community reason why I attend

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:24,360
change camp is to experience the the

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:27,210
cyphers atmosphere of depth community

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,490
and I think it's the reason why taya

00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,920
community is going so fast I actually

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,670
first came to this conference two years

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,230
ago on a scholarship ticket like the

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,700
next year I was kind of watching the

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,910
tool to me interacting with people on

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,640
Twitter this year I'm here as a speaker

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,010
and throughout that journey I have made

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,320
some incredible friends Jos home feel is

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,750
really the one event that brings the

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,130
whole JavaScript community together

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,390
across different frameworks across

00:02:53,130 --> 00:03:20,739
different libraries

00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:20,739
[Music]

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,980
me personally the thing I love about us

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,660
compass I've made friends in my

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,450
adulthood that I wouldn't have normally

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,190
made how welcoming is the community to

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,840
people from all over the world and how

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,880
they try to make it happen with

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,310
scholarships and so on that really

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,530
people feel welcomed and integrated into

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,230
the conference so no matter where you're

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,540
from what languages you speak your

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,700
access Nate Holland the organizers and

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,410
the volunteers has been so much effort

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,110
into trying to make this event as

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,240
accessible as possible for everyone that

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,220

people that are on the standards bodies

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,400
and making the frameworks with the

00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,770
people who are the future of JavaScript

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,190
