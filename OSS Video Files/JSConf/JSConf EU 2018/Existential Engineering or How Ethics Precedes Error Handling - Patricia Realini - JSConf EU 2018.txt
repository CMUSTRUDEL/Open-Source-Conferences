Title: Existential Engineering or How Ethics Precedes Error Handling - Patricia Realini - JSConf EU 2018
Publication date: 2018-06-20
Playlist: JSConf EU 2018
Description: 
	If Javascript has taught me anything it is that when something goes wrong, only computers can use the excuse that they are “just following orders”. Though our code is interpreted literally by our machines, our intentions and unconscious biases are not. By looking at the various schools of ethics available to us, existing code of ethics for engineers, and the most pressing ethical dilemmas plaguing our industry today, we can make the world wide web a better place for everyone.

OMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/

Hi, everyone.

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,210
Thank you so much for coming here today, and a big shout out to the organisers for putting

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,210
this event together.

00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,760
I'm very honoured to get to be on this stage and talk to you about some really serious

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,280
stuff.

00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,000
In 2016, the most pressing topic of the year for software engineers was empathy, and, in

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,140
2017, the topic of the year was inclusion, and, this year, the topic seems to be about

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,839
ethics, which I'm really excited about, because the discourse grows more and more concerning

00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,219
each day.

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,729
Even though these issues feel like new wounds, they have a long history steeped in bias,

00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:52,899
and systemic oppression, and we need to pay attention to these things.

00:00:52,899 --> 00:01:01,210
Data and society research institute recently hosted Author Algorithms of Oppression, talking

00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,210
about technological red lining.

00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:10,480
Noble reflected at the event on her upbringing in Fresno, California.

00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:20,470
She recalls seeing the KKK in public, the sun set curfew on black people, the black

00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:27,060
poor side of town was a food desert which meant there were no grocery stores at all.

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:36,910
With no buses serving the town, it meant there was a huge burden placed on the poor and the

00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,670
black people of Fresno, California.

00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,830
Her talking about that history and having grown newspaper that environment, and how

00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,520
it shaped her to be the person who she was and pushed her to do the research that she

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,500
did to publish the book Algorithms of Oppression, reminded me about the forgotten New York City

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,310
of neighbourhood of Manhattan Town.

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:09,280
In 1905, the colour line was broken in Colombia University when he began purchasing real estate

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:19,980
on upper 99th Street and then between Columbus Avenue and Central Park West.

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,069
There were a lot of notable resident of Manhattan town, including some of the most venerated

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:28,879
artists and intellectuals of the Harlem Renaissance.

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:40,959
One of my trivia facts was that Sadie Fagin, the mother of Billie Holliday ran a cafe called

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:49,420
Mom Holidays, where she got in an argument with Billie wanting to borrow money, and that's

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,340
when she came up with the title of the song God Bless The Child.

00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:02,629
By 19 inform the 1955, those two blocks were nothing but rubble.

00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:09,919
In 1949, President Harry Truman signed the Housing Act which gave Robert Moses in his

00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,540
position as Chairman of the New York City Selenium committee, the power to condemn building

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,450
and steal land under the guise of urban renewal.

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,769
He would grant the land to companies of his choosing, often as a way to amass political

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:26,189
favour.

00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:31,200
Manhattan Town was literally the very first neighbourhood that Moses picked to do this

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,530
to.

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,469
Residents of Manhattan Town were evicted in 1951, the buildings were torn down, and most

00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:45,760
of it was just rubble until the 1960s when the Park West Village Apartments were built.

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,049
Moses did irrevocable social I don't economic damage by forcing more than 300,000 families

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:58,329
out of their home in the name of urban renewal.

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:05,469
Here you can see on maps, the two blocks are gone, and in their place are the Park West

00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:09,029
Apartments and a Whole Foods Markets.

00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:17,209
We talk about displacement of people through gentrification.

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,900
In April of this year, Saheed Vassell was killed by the New York Police Department as

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,800
a consequence of gentrification.

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,360
And tech has been responsible for all the gentrification of all of San Francisco, and

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:40,630
made it easy for the culture neighbourhoods, Little Havana in Miami, and much of Brooklyn

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:48,640
and New York, to be digitally erased by prioritising commonly search terms that gain prominence.

00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,430
When we use Google to search for things, we teach those machines that that is the priority,

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,620
and, since many times low-income people don't have access, they don't have a need to Google

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,500
for something, that means, when there is more attention paid to a neighbourhood, when gentrification

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,690
starts happening, the software we are writing is backing that up.

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,720
So, algorithms with the help of machine-learning are not objective.

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,980
They're instilled with the biases by the people who write them, when measures are not taken

00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,090
to consider the consequences of disruption.

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,780
This is why we need to apply more scrutiny when it comes to whether or not the features

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,960
we push as software are ethical.

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,910
Satre's theory of existentialism dictates that humans creates their own values and determine

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,620
their meaning to their life.

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,810
For Satre, once an oppressive situation is regarded as such by those who feel oppressed,

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,010
the situation becomes intolerable.

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:51,040
We are then compelled to project our intentions on to our present condition and transform

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,630
them into action.

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:58,810
And because ethical dilemmas disproportionately affect under represented minorities, it is

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,350
important to take the time to listen to us instead of assuming what we need.

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:09,920
Some of the most pressing dilemmas right now are surrounding the issues of privacy, surveillance,

00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,310
data, and discrimination.

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,940
Of course, we've all heard about the way that Cambridge Analytica unethically used Facebook's

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,370
data, but there are even more serious things happening right now, especially in the United

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,370
States.

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:29,840
The Stop LED Spying Coalition recently released a report about the harassment and mistreatment

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,050
of low-income black people due to the use of predictive policing software by Palantir

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:42,500
that they sold to the LAPD and nearly sold to the New York Police Department.

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:49,340
Amazon is trying to get into the predictive policing with product recognition.

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:55,560
It has the power to recognise people in large groups of people and crowded events and public

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,780
places, and they include race as an identifier which results in increased bias.

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,130
None of these issues are new.

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:13,860
In 2016, Pro Publica uncovered bias, in the Compass software, correctional management

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:22,900
profiling for alternative sanctions, and it is used by courts to automatically determine

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:29,060
if sentencing based on criminal recidivism scores set by questions that have extreme

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,550
bias, against low-income black people, so how do we prevent this kind of discrimination?

00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:40,770
How do we prevent our software from ending people's lives?

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,790
We need to agree on what the ethical foundation of our work is in this industry, in the workplace,

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,260
and in the world.

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:55,020
In 1985, James Moore detailed in his essay What Is Computer Ethics, these four tenets.

00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:01,890
It's important to apply these to the workplace and ask these questions when we talk about

00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,480
machine-learning, AI, and data collection, just to name a few.

00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,900
According to Professor Margaret Ann Pierce, she defined the need for the following three

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:23,490
ethical influences: an individual personal code, an informal code of ethics, and - I'm

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:30,590
sorry - an informal code of ethics, and a code of ethics in the workplace.

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,820
Because, unlike our code, we can't say that we were only taking orders.

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:43,390
Or, as it was been called, rationalising in the way of the little - I like to remember,

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:50,500
when we talk about ethics, the root Greek word is "ethos" which translates to "habit"

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:57,150
or "custom", and that is the key to developing an ethical framework, because we need to be

00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,150
accountable.

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,050
We need to make it a habit; we need to make it a custom.

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:11,180
In the essay Moral Machines, they wrote about how machine ethics were drive advancement

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,320
in human ethics but forcing us to address gaps in modern normative theories of ethics.

00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
This is our moral imperative.

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:26,780
It is our job to consider the ways that our actions are shaping the ethical world.

00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,810
Here are some organisations with their own form al codes.

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,430
Right how in the United States, the only CS programmes that require ethics are the ones

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:41,530
that are ABET accredited, but the Association For Computer Machinery - ACM - is considered

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,090
one of the most appropriate for web development.

00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:49,760
I urge you all to look up all six of these, and pick one.

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,279
Apply it to your work.

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,190
Apply it to the decisions that you make.

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:02,260
Practising ethical decision-making in the workplace is about stretching your imagination.

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:10,110
The EFF recently published a science fiction story by Corey Doctrau to consider the sections

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:17,390
of 12.01 of the DMCA and how, coming down hard on copyright infringement, will change

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,390
society.

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:28,300
It is important not just to think about these issues, it's important that we act on them.

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,990
If you remember Robert Moses, the man who basically pushed all of those people out of

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,660
Manhattanville, his legacy was extremely far reaching.

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:47,589
He was a big fan of the automobile, and he wanted to build a highway that would run right

00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:52,590
down the middle of Washington Square Park, and carve up the middle of the park, carve

00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,660
up the middle of the neighbourhood, and just send trucks and cars right down the middle

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,730
of the neighbourhood, because he felt innovation in automobiles was more important than the

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,080
lives of the people in the communities.

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:12,221
He was also making a lot of money for a lot of other people, and felt that that was more

00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:16,190
important than the people who were living in these homes.

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,760
But, he was stopped.

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,779
Washington Square Park, if you've ever been there, has no highway running through it,

00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:26,430
and that's because of this person.

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,970
This is Jane Jacobs.

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,980
She was a writer.

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,321
She most notably published a book called The death and Life of Great American Cities, and

00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:38,790
she was an activist in New York City.

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,589
When Robert Moses came to that neighbourhood, when he came to Washington Square Park, Jane

00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:55,020
Jacobs organised the people of the neighbourhood and put together activism to keep Robert Moses

00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,900
from enacting his plan.

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,750
Jane Jacobs was really good at the photo op.

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:08,190
She put moms with strollers in the middle of the park to protest, and she had a ribbon

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:14,930
re-tying ceremony in the park to mock Moses' ribbon-cutting ceremony that he would do when

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:21,230
he opened new highways and bridges, about and because she rallied all of these people

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:29,080
and participated in civil disobedience, got arrested for protesting at city hearings,

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,340
the mayor was forced to stop these plans that Robert Moses had to build a highway through

00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,390
the middle of the park.

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,460
What ended up happening was he went on and he tried to continue to do this, and, as he

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,160
continued to try to do this in other neighbourhoods, tried to carve the middle of Canal Street

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,220
down in New York City, and Jane Jacobs came back and pushed him down, they kept and got

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,920
to maintain the living that they already had.

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,339
They were able to defend themselves, and, we recently saw this happen too in our industry,

00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:15,000
because just yesterday, Google - Gizmodo reported Google will not be renewing their contract

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,089
for Project Maven with the DOD because the actions employees took.

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:27,600
A dozen employees resigned, signed paperwork saying they didn't believe that this was analytical

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,550
decision, didn't want to participate in writing AI software for drones, and, because of this,

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,190
just like the civil disobedience and the activism of Jane Jacobs, we, too, can have an effect

00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,730
on our industry.

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,270
Companies are willing to ... [Applause].

00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:54,959
Consider how much money companies are willing to pay to get our attention.

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,520
How much money they're willing to pay us in salaries; how much money they're spending

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,410
to sponsor conferences just like this one.

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:08,290
We have power over them as a collective group, and we need to - it's our moral imperative

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:14,140
to use that power for good and not for evil, and we need to come up with an ethical framework

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,380
to do that that is more explicit than just good versions evil.

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,370
We need to decide on codes of ethics, the same way that we decide on codes of conduct

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,570
for our conferences.

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:31,100
Codes of conduct are just ethical - codes of ethics that we apply to our internal group.

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,250
It is deciding the ways that we want to treat the people in our society.

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:46,430
So we need to apply the same kind of codes to our work and the world at large.

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:51,140
[Applause].

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:58,120
It's our job to design computers, to design phones, to design software, in a way that

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:06,360
no-one dies, and to consider the historical, global, political, social, and economic repercussions

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,160
of the work that we do.

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:19,029
I want to encourage each and every one of you to consider the ways that you can make

00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:23,810
your work more ethical, the ways that you can prevent people from being harmed by the

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,779
software that you write, whether it be through gentrification in maps, through AI having

00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:38,490
bias, in machine-learning, or even on your team, when the team-mates are the subject

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,530
of their own oppression.

00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,670
What are you doing with your power to help the people who you work with and the people

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,500
of the world at large?

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,910
God will not have his work made manifest by cowards before you have to be brave, you have

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,290
to take that responsibility on yourself.
