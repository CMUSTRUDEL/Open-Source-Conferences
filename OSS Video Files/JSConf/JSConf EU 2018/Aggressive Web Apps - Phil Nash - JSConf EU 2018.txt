Title: Aggressive Web Apps - Phil Nash - JSConf EU 2018
Publication date: 2018-06-06
Playlist: JSConf EU 2018
Description: 
	Push notifications on the web can be a force for good, but is that how they are coming across? We'll take a look at how push notifications permissions are being implemented and how we can do it better. We'll then look at the notifications themselves, find out what the best kind of notifications are and how not to wind up with your app's, or the entire web's, notifications blocked forever.

JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/

Can I send you push notifications.

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,240
Do I have to be here?

00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,380
All right.

00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,460
[Laughter].

00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,850
So that was a poor start.

00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,850
But let's try again.

00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,850
Hi, everyone.

00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,850
My name is Phil Nash.

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,250
I'm a developer evangelist at Twilio.

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,480
What I'm here to talk to you about today is progressive web apps.

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:52,659
We've not heard a lot about them this time around at JSConf which means it's an part

00:00:52,659 --> 00:01:04,430
in the life cycle of a new feature of the way that we build applications.

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,360
What I like is the technology behind it and what we can do with it, and the service worker

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,200
is my favourite thing, because we have JavaScript that runs outside of our page now.

00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,030
I love that.

00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:24,250
What I really love about it is that it's now supported in every major browser!

00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,460
[Cheering].

00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:36,780
This means we can start talking to our places of work and businesses to build application

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,970
that is are better for users, can build for interesting stuff and native app-like features

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,830
because that's some of the things that we've been missing that the native applications

00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,490
have had over us.

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,320
One of those is push notifications.

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,690
I think push notifications are wonderful which is why I want to talk about them today, because

00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,530
I'm not sure you do!

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,510
Push notifications are probably important to cover because it is not quite everyone

00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,030
because we can get there, and we can do it.

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,750
You know how to do push notifications.

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,500
You have had a native app.

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,340
We will get there.

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,239
I just wanted to show a quick example because I'm so delighted that it did appear - this

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,390
is Edge.

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,670
It works in Edge.

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,870
Out of the box for the first version of service workers push notifications came in, it was

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,319
way, and then wooh!

00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:39,120
And I had to redownload a VM for that, because, you know.

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,650
If I go to Can I Use, it looks red and dangerous.

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,700
If you're looking at the reds and greens on this, it's not correct.

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,440
You want to look in the top right corner there where it says almost 75 per cent of active

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,610
users based on the global stats, almost 75 per cent of people have access to these.

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,700
You need to be thinking about them and building them in the correct way.

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,140
Push notifications are good, and that's what I want to talk to you today.

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,990
We are going to cover three things.

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,550
Briefly, how to push, with then we're going to talk about good push notifications, and

00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,400
then talk about permissions.

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,480
Permissions get sculls because we're doing it wrong.

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:34,180
Quickly on how to push: there's quite a convoluted setup to make push notifications work.

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:40,170
You start with a user and a browser, and you have to register your service worker.

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:47,019
Once you do that, you can ask for permission to send push notifications to the user.

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:54,459
When they say - if they say yes, you will get back a URL and a couple of encryption

00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:02,540
keys which you will want to save on your server somewhere so you can use them later.

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,410
When you make a push notification, from your server you send a post request to the URL

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,209
you got which is the browser's push notification service.

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,840
You can encrypt information with that with the keys you got earlier so the browsers can't

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,430
read what you're sending to your users, and then the service will send a push to your

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:33,120
device which will wake up the service worker, which will react, send it back and make it

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,289
happen.

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:38,190
I'm not going to go into the technical side of that, the code, or anything.

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:57,940
If you want to find out 

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:05,729
about that [sound distorted].

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,430
This is a tweet that comes across every once in a while on Twitter.

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,490
[Inaudible].

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,570
I don't think that's true.

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,810
I don't believe that.

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,379
I want push notifications for something.

00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:22,160
They're useful things for us.

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,560
Push notifications are incredibly useful for the right things.

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:34,720
I do believe that the person that says that maybe doesn't want push notifications.

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,830
It's entirely possible that you are a person who, when you get your phone, the first thing

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,210
you go is go to settings and turn off notifications and never get that, and that's fine, but it's

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,320
not true for everyone.

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,350
I have examples of good notifications and we need to hear them.

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,940
Appointment reminders is a good one.

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,490
I work at Twilio.

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:07,870
We've an API for sending text messages we have had for around eight years now, and text

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,560
messages get used for notification purposes as well.

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,900
One of our clients, the Arkansas Children's Hospital used appointment reminders.

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,370
They cut down no-shows, bearing in mind this is a children's hospital, appointments for

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,360
sick children's, no-shows were 20 per cent.

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,039
After they implemented notifications to say, "You've got an appointment tomorrow", it dropped

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,900
to two per cent.

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,180
That's real-life, important stuff, keeping doctors doing the job they should be doing

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,110
and getting kids to appointments they need to going to.

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,040
Chat alert is an obvious one.

00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,699
I'm sure we would like to ignore them some of the time, because they're not normally

00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,789
always good news, but then I know that having been in Berlin for the last week, I kind of

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,740
tried to hang out and meet one different people.

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,259
The push notifications of various chatting and messaging people have kept me on the ball

00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,850
for that.

00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,449
ETA alerts.

00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:09,449
Things arriving.

00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,639
If you order a car, food, any kind of delivery at all, getting a notification that it's there

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,639
is excellent.

00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,840
It means that you actually leave your house and get in the car, or you pick up that food.

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,889
Event updates, you don't want to download an entire native application for a one or

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:28,889
two-day event.

00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:40,490
Some of the other events, like flights, and three different planes to get here, being

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,389
told an updated when I could check in, and also when there were delays.

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,350
It makes that so much easier.

00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:57,780
These notifications have three tenets to them that you should consider when building push

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,069
notifications: timely, actionable, and personal.

00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:04,139
Timely is sort of obvious.

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,360
If I get a push notification to say that my car has just arrived after I finished the

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,560
journey, that's not very useful.

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,100
There are other considerations to that as well.

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,610
This is a picture that goes around Twitter once in a while as well.

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:25,830
It is the Slack decision tree of whether to send somebody a push notification.

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:32,519
A whole bunch of those things are time-based stuff.

00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,880
Is the person asleep?

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Working?

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,099
Do they really need this?

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,740
Weirdly enough, when I'm using Slack, I can be on the desktop typing a message to somebody

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,949
and my phone will buzz with a notification, so I modified this to - that's how it works

00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:49,300
for me.

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,160
I don't know what's gone on there.

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,040
These are the considerations like the time of day, the time zone, and the number of notifications

00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,519
you're sending somebody as well.

00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,379
You don't want to keep piling them on.

00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:01,730
That's not helpful after a while.

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:11,040
Then you have actionable stuff, where you get something that you can do something about.

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,930
If you receive a chat message from someone, then you want to read it, respond to it, deal

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,040
with that.

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,180
If your car is here and it's time to leave the house, or time to go on the street and

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,829
look for it.

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:26,059
If your flight is open for check-in, you might get the extra leg room seats if you check

00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:28,809
in now - important to me.

00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:31,660
Then they're personal.

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,949
One thing you might have noticed is they're all about you.

00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:40,319
And I'm pretty sure, if you searched Twitter two weeks ago for push notifications, lots

00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:44,889
of people very surprised that they had 20 or so notifications that some guy was getting

00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:49,459
married, as the royal wedding goes off and news organisations are like we must push this

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:51,160
to everything.

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,899
It's not personal, actionable, or interesting at all.

00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:55,899
That's not true.

00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:01,980
Some people probably wanted that, but I didn't, so it's fine.

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,309
You can break the rules on this, though.

00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:08,149
Some people might have wanted royal wedding notifications.

00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:15,389
A really good example of this back in 2016 when the Guardian team in the UK covered the

00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:20,699
UK general election, and did this experiment with push notifications that kept people up

00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:26,509
to date with how the votes were coming in overnight.

00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:32,700
This is an amazing bit of work as well, because they actually assembled this image in the

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,389
service worker, and, if you work with a service worker, you know that there is no canvas element,

00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:41,639
there's no way to manipulate images properly so they were doing it entirely with buffers,

00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,350
which is kind of amazing.

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,470
This actually shows one other thing.

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,600
In the middle between latest declared and settings, there's a button to stop.

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,259
That's one they programmed in, because maybe you do want to go to bed because this goes

00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,670
all night, and you don't want to keep hitting notifications.

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:06,730
So you have to let people opt out from within your application.

00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,690
This is the Twitter iOS application where you can choose who push notifications you

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,690
get.

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,679
They have a bad reputation of adding things to this and checking them, so you have to

00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:23,850
keep revisiting once in a while, but, if I want at mentions but I don't want Twitter

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:31,790
news, because then you can go and sort it out inside the application.

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:37,649
Because alternative for us on the web is terrible.

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,369
The alternative looks a little like this.

00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:44,899
I'm going to go out to Chrome for a second here.

00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,959
Make sure notifications are working.

00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,209
We are registering for push notifications there.

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,309
When I send one, it will come into the screen.

00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:04,800
It will come into the screen ... . It's not going to do it.

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Cool.

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,710
In the notification, you get to see - as you hover over it, there are two buttons: one

00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,709
importantly, is settings.

00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:18,629
When you click the settings button, you get taken to this screen which allows you to block

00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:25,949
that individual website, and, even worse, allows you to block all of them.

00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:33,939
If one website sends a bad push notification a user can't opt out of, it's a very quickstep

00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:40,269
to that user blocking every single application's push notifications.

00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:42,790
This is what is looks like in Firefox as well.

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,420
It's not good.

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,019
I am terrified that the rest of the internet can affect my application in that way.

00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:57,689
If I'm sending useful things to a user that they want to receive, but they get put off

00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:06,129
by an abuse of this API, then that is horrifying.

00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:13,519
So, this leads me on to the other other terrifying part of this which is the permissions.

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:23,100
I found one of those tweets that kind of said, "Dear every website, I don't want you to post

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,949
notifications to my website, I don't want you to know my location, please stop autoplaying

00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:33,279
that video, I'm angry and sad now."

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:40,359
Websites are making using angry and sad because they're doing this.

00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:45,579
The power of the web has been increasingly increasing over the recent years as we get

00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:55,589
the ability to use methods and device capabilities like geolocation, like the push notifications,

00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:02,350
like media devices, camera, and microphone, Bluetooth, maybe, web TV, all of those things,

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,769
but we require permission for them because they're more invasive.

00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:12,540
That is correct, and the web has had this permissions model that you ask for it when

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:18,199
you need it, which is good, except we keep asking and doing lot of things.

00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,489
It doesn't make you ask you when you need it.

00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:27,029
I want to pick on a couple of sites.

00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,689
Apologies to them but they should shot have done this.

00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:34,339
This is what happens when you load producthunt.com for the first time.

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:42,639
When you get there for the first time, why are we being asked for permissions for push

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,910
notifications?

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,649
This is cnet, a tech and review site.

00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,299
Push notifications first time.

00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:53,600
This is sitepoint.com.

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,049
Not only permissions but an entire page overlay asking you to pay for stuff.

00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:02,699
You don't even know what the site does yet.

00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,930
It's supposed to look like that.

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,919
This is a site that does tutorials on web development.

00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:16,769
YouTube did it the other day.

00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,429
This is the home page.

00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:23,069
It gave me no context about what it what happened wanted to do with these push notifications,

00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:26,360
it justified asked for permission.

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,309
Context is absolutely kick in this case - absolutely king.

00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:37,139
Would would you give permission to any site to have one of those invasive permissions?

00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,870
This counts for geolocation, and counts for media devices as well.

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,139
Why would you give permission to one of those sites without context?

00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:53,910
And then in recent changes from Chrome, they stopped allowing you to dismiss the permission.

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,609
You either block or allow.

00:15:56,609 --> 00:16:00,209
So that is straight into block straightaway, obviously.

00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,240
We need to stop this.

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,479
We need to stop this or our users will stop it for us.

00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:15,279
There are sites like howtogee k saying how to turn them off.

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,179
this is one or two sites that can ruin for the rest of us, and ruin it for the users

00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:34,029
as well. and Firefox. if you're here, which I hope you are, let's have a chat about this.

00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,879
I don't think this is cool.

00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:39,939
I don't think building a feature, and then telling people that the feature you built

00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:45,589
into your browser is terrible is a good idea, especially when I think we can agree some

00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:53,959
of those push notification examples I gave earlier are good ideas and can help meme.

00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,209
maybe now you can think of some good reasons to get push notifications on Firefox.

00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,769
let's sort this out.

00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:09,760
so, please, if you have built push notifications into your website at all, do not demand notification

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,500
permissions on page load.

00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,839
don't!

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,179
[Applause].

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:29,190
my worry, as I said already, is that permissions have become the new pop-ups. they will be

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:35,110
reviled and dismissed by users, but just the annoyances in the browser, and it doesn't

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,299
matter what the feature behind them is, where there is push locations, geolocation, whatever,

00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,049
they dismiss it, it's not care.

00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:50,380
when they dismiss them by default, our web platform loses its power to build engaging

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:57,190
and useful experiences for those users.

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,350
that little check box is terrifying.

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,710
so, please, don't demand notification permissions on page load.

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,620
I have some suggestions, though.

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,700
I don't think I can reach everybody by standing on stage here.

00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,140
I'm glad to reach you and tell you this, but we have to do better than that.

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,360
I have some suggestions for now, and then for the future, how we can improve this in

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
general.

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,779
for now, it is better patterns of UX for this.

00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:31,779
wait.

00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:39,159
build up the context that will make the user aware of why you need that permission.

00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:46,240
Matt gaunt from the Chrome team wrote a great post and an example application based on this.

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,500
he built a fake airline ticketing site.

00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,880
once you've finished the purchase process of an airline ticket, at the bottom of the

00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,730
screen, it pops up "get notifications for flight delays."

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,280
you've bought an airline ticket and you have no wish to turn up to the airport ten hours

00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,600
early because your flight is delayed.

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,350
this seems like a good idea.

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:16,240
I know exactly what I'm going to get out of this.

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,970
it can be obvious.

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,740
still don't put the permissions up, but if you're building a chat application like Slack,

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,539
that top bar at the top is reasonable.

00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:30,720
it is the same for geolocation permissions. if there there is a map on the back of the

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,860
screen behind the notification, it's probably obvious what we are trying to do here.

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,930
that's fine.

00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:44,059
but, for the future, this I think is more important, because, I think together, we can

00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,120
work to fix this in general.

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,970
this needs to be the start of a conversation or the continuing of a conversation that has

00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,970
existed.

00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:01,399
My suggestion was that browsers should enforce the user interaction before asking for a permission.

00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:06,210
Something like "pop-ups" where you have to have had a click before you can pop something

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,740
up.

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,269
there's arguments about this, but you can get involved in them.

00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:20,400
On the GitHub, on the WICG repos, there is an interventions repo which is great.

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,009
issue 49 is the suggestion from have been else that there should be an interaction before

00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,009
a permissions pop-up.

00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:35,610
That has stalled right now because there are a couple of companies that have built up a

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,899
service that does push notifications on behalf of other websites, for those websites that

00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:48,590
haven't managed to change on to HTTPS yet, which you need for the service worker.

00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,730
I think those businesses are tenuous at best.

00:20:52,730 --> 00:21:00,010
it is a - while I'm sympathetic with the fact they're trying to build a business, I'm not

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,340
sure it's a great foundation to be doing so on.

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,030
Maybe a user interaction is not the best suggestion.

00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,269
We need to get involved and come up with better ones.

00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:18,800
There is the permissions API, an emerging spec from the W3C, and it collects in one

00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:28,490
place where you can find out if you have asked for permission and what the response was.

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,379
But I feel like that could be better as well.

00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:37,450
perhaps we could have an API that asks us whether we can ask permission yet.

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:45,470
Perhaps the browser should be implementing some kind of heuristic 

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,510
for a progressive web app, you can only add to home screen after a certain amount of engagement.

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,880
We need this to be deterministic as well.

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,860
so being asked to ask the permissions API whether I have enough engagement yet might

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,179
be a good.

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,299
but again, I need more ideas, and I need more input for this, and we need to start talking

00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,379
about it more.

00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:13,049
So, in conclusion, I think push notifications are awesome - for the right things.

00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:21,120
not for breaking news, but for important timely actionable and personal actions.

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:30,549
One more time for this one: do not ever demand permissions for anything on a page load.

00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:36,410
make those notifications timely, actionable, and personal, or don't, break the rules, but

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:44,809
allow those users to opt out side your application so they don't turn it off for everyone.

00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:48,960
For users like that, the whole web suffers.

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,649
They suffer because they can't get the good notifications we're talking about.

00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:57,690
they will block it if they have a bad experience.

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:09,610
but we, as good develop - we can pry good experiences for these permissions and notifications

00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,169
in general.

00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:16,440
We might have to work together to find out how we can do this better, but that's what

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
I want to see.

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,090
And I want us to see us building progressive web apps that improve experiences for users,

00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:30,259
that improve the web in general, and not aggressive web apps which get up in everybody's face

00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:33,200
and make users sad and angry.

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,290
We can go and do that.

00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,290
thank you so much.

00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:36,293
