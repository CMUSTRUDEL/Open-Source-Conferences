	Full title: Unintended Consequences: How to Reduce Exclusionary Practices In Our Organizations and Communities

“You cannot manage what you cannot measure.”

Building a successful business requires more than just understanding customer discovery, go-to-market strategies, legal issues, and raising capital. Successful businesses are built on foundations that enable leaders to turn information into knowledge in order to scale, evolve, and recover.

Everybody should have their owm theme music.

00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:34,860
Hello everyone!

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,110
Hello everyone!

00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,110
Alright!

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:44,020
If you don't follow me on Twitter you should know it is not going to be a quite room.

00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,190
Welcome to unintended consequences.

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,710
How ro reduce exclusionary practices in our organizations and communities.

00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,170
I am Kim Crayton.

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,600
You can use the hashtag #causeascene.

00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
You can find me @KimCrayton1.

00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,390
I have a website hashtagcauseascene.com as well as kimcrayton.com.

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,560
After this I usually would put my credentials in there, but you know what, I'm causing such

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,970
a scene, I don't care if you don't trust what I have to say.

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,659
I know what I'm talking about.

00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,490
So, there it is.

00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,299
First, and also, there it is.

00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,039
So, let's define some terms.

00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:29,200
I am an educator by trade.

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,590
I entered tech four years ago.

00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,409
I like to start everybody on the same page.

00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:42,030
So that, when I get into my talk, people are saying, yeah, I don't know what that means,

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,209
so we just start off everybody in the same place.

00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:49,140
Privilege is about access.

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,359
When I talk about privilege, I don't just talk about race, and gender and all these

00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,869
things, I talk about access, that means there is a group of people who have more access

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,710
to resource s, connections, than other groups.

00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,560
That's what privilege is.

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
It's that simple.

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
It's about access.

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,080
So I use this picture, because everybody, people have seen these monkeys in Japan thinking

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,269
that's so cute.

00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:19,459
What is there is an example of access, because there's a family of female family group that

00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,970
is only — they are the only ones who get in the water.

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,849
The other monkeys on the outside, they've got to fend for themselves.

00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,189
If they freeze to death, they only freeze to death.

00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,370
It's only a family of monkeys that can get in.

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:38,200
So this family has access to this pool of hot water where others don't.

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,549
Under-represented is about numbers.

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:41,650
That's all it's.

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:48,390
In tech, white women are under represented.

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,040
Marginalised is about treatment.

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,000
In tech, many white women are not marginalised, so I like to make that distinction because,

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,409
when people say they want diversity, adding a white woman to your team, or to your panel,

00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:09,189
is not diversity.

00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,819
Diversity is about variety.

00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,269
I know I'm from the States, and we have Crayola crayons.

00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,650
When you get that big box.

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,799
When I was a child, I got 64 crayons as an own child.

00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,420
That's what variety and diversity about.

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,370
Inclusion is the Holy Grail.

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,519
It is about experience.

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,950
It is about everyone having the experience they expect when they come in contact with

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,650
your business, your community, or your event.

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,569
Inclusion is not about equity, because if you white man and I, black woman from the

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:51,989
south of the United States, start the race at the same time, you're still going to be

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:52,989
ahead of me.

00:03:52,989 --> 00:04:00,120
I need you to stop, sit down for a second, and let me catch up, and pass you!

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,519
Inclusion is not about quotas.

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,280
That's under representation.

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,609
Inclusion is about people's experiences with your companies, your communities, and your

00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:16,079
events.

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,590
So we're going to talk about some businesses here, and these are some of the things that

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,990
get — that I find that get individuals in trouble or get them in places you don't want

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,010
to be with these unintended consequences because many people think they have a business when,

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,690
in fact, they have a product or a service.

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,440
A product or a service is not a business.

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,720
A business requires processes, policies, and procedures that allow you to grow, scale,

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,680
recover, but for the fact that you have created a product or service, you do not necessarily

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
have a business.

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,370
That's why BC can come in and take your company because they bring in those scales that help

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,030
you grow and everything else.

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,420
And I blame the lean canvas model for this because that is about iterating a product

00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,690
or a service and not about a business.

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,990
Also, you cannot manage what you do not measure.

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,220
You can't.

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,110
You can get.

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,650
But you will never know where you are exactly if you can manage it — you cannot manage

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,780
it if you cannot measure.

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,780
It.

00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not a person who reads up these things.

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,900
These things appeared, because I don't remember why, I ad lib a lot.

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,539
All too often, organisations fail, and, when I say organisations, I mean businesses and

00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,539
communities.

00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:33,539
I'm going to make that one thing.

00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:38,069
When I'm talking about organisations, that's what I'm talking about, because, or become

00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:43,819
toxic, because the leaders don't understand that growth requires processes that enable

00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,900
connectedness, innovation, and competitive advantage.

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,870
What happens is you have a group of — we're going to talk about white man because that's

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,169
what we are full of.

00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,410
You have a group of white men who go to university, who come up with this project, and this is

00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,410
great.

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,970
Let's do this to make money.

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,949
They step over here with the same intelligent hat when they're in their frat.

00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,419
They have not thought about business being different.

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:13,360
So they behave the same way.

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,770
They stay up the same amount of hours they used to — that's why you have these Ping-Pong

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,922
tables — they have women and marginalised groups, we couldn't care less about all that

00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:26,860
— I'm going home — I don't even know how to play Ping-Pong, I can't even keep it on

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,379
the table!

00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:33,160
We don't — I'm not interested in drinking beer with you on the job.

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,110
I want to do my job, and I want to go home.

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,849
Successful organisations are built on foundations that enable their leaders to turn information

00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:47,780
into knowledge in order to scale, evolve, and recover.

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,990
That's what a business is.

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:55,819
If you can't scale it, if you can't recover, or if you can't evolve, what you created for

00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,040
yourself is a job.

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,920
It's not a business.

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,479
So you see people who work at restaurants, and they can't ever leave.

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,479
They have to be there all day.

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,800
That's a job.

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,710
They created a job for themselves.

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,110
You want to be able to to work on your business and not work in your business.

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:22,229
And so, is it we all know, being technologists, Google has everything.

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:26,590
But just because you could find information on Google does not mean it's knowledge for

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,590
you.

00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,440
You have to do something to internalise that information before it becomes knowledge, so

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,009
it's a lived experience.

00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,470
That's one point they're missing.

00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:43,630
The ability for organisation leads to successfully create and manage operations relies heavily

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,039
on how well they are there are available and necessary processes.

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,439
Here, we talked about that you have to have the information that turns in the knowledge

00:07:52,439 --> 00:08:01,139
that will allow you to scale, evolve, and to recover, then you need to have the acumen,

00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,520
the ability, to put those processes in place to allow you to evolve, scale, recover.

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,069
I'm going to be honest with you: many of you don't have these.

00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,949
Many of you are developers.

00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,720
Many of you don't care to learn anything else.

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,990
Like I say at many of my talks, if you don't have these human-centric skills, you will

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,200
be out of a job soon, and you will be one or the other.

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:34,219
I, on the other hand, who has a different set of technical skills, you have technology

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:39,180
skills, I have a different set of skills, I hate when they call my skills soft because

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,490
many don't have them, I am a person who can deal with human beings, I will always have

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,740
a job.

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,240
You need to start thinking about that.

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,880
When leaders take the time to understand and operationalise — this is a key word — operationalise

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,320
their organisation's functions, they avoid common barriers to success while being able

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,370
to recover more quickly from unexpected events.

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,639
Unexpected events are going to happen.

00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,490
As the first speaker talked about airs, we know that's not in our code.

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,560
When you're building a business.

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,300
You're testing stuff out.

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,090
You think you have it, and there is your site's down, or your accountant ran off with your

00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,610
money — whatever it is.

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,930
There will be unexpected events.

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,450
Having these things in place allows you to prepare at least for some of that.

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,150
Many businesses have no plans in place.

00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,780
They're just going on, and whatever happens, happens, and then they're just like, "I don't

00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
know."

00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,670
"I don't know why Cambridge Analytica has our data.

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,370
I don't know why we didn't go back after four years and did somebody check and see if they

00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,700
destroyed that?"

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:59,120
I don't know all these things, because there are processes in place.

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,160
Building a successful organisation with fewer unintended consequences requires more than

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,610
a great product to serve — again, a product — it requires leaders being able to give

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,940
all stakeholders — all stakeholders — the experiences they want and the ability is to

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,230
manage a process.

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,470
This is where inclusion comes.

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,990
It's about experiences, and I'm going to tell you what stakeholders I'm talking about in

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,120
just a moment.

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,610
I would like to talk to leaders because I have nothing against people who are not in

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,510
leadership, but you have absolutely no power, no agency, no resources, and you cannot move

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,160
these things forward, and what you do is you become burnt out.

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
You become frustrated, because they are telling you at the top that these things are important

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,630
to you but they're not giving you any resources or backing so that you can do anything with

00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,910
it, so you're banging your head against the ceiling, and they're telling you are doing

00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:01,889
such a great job but you feel guilty, I'm tired, I want to be more inclusive — this

00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:06,610
has to come from leadership.

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:12,340
When I talk about all stakeholders, I believe building businesses for social change.

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,780
We are in a time where everybody has access to information.

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,779
We are at a time where pretty — a lot of people are very polarised.

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,820
And I can speak from the United States.

00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,550
I don't want to make any assumptions about Germany, but I know our government is not

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,110
run by politicians, it's run by business owners.

00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:41,010
It is run by very wealthy business owners who can pay lobbyists to give money to politicians,

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,660
and politicians in turn maybe decisions based on the money they received.

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,769
So, when we talk about — when I say all stakeholders, in a traditional business, it

00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,990
is just about as shareholder.

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,550
This is what gets me, because people get upset about jobs leaving.

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,740
I'm going to give you some business education if you don't know this.

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:09,170
In the United States — again, don't know about Germany — it is illegal for a board

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:16,420
of directors, or a CEO, their first priority has to be shareholder value.

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:22,680
So, if they do something or make a decision that would not bring the shareholders as much

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,279
money as possible, they can be sued by said shareholders.

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,690
So, I found ed it — I found it quite interesting that, during the previous election, all these

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:42,800
people — coal jobs are gone, they ain't bringing them back.

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,560
The carrier, they thought they were going — those jobs weren't going to go to Mexico.

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,500
I don't care who trump is, or who everybody else is, the shareholders of that company

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:59,649
own that company, and the CEO and the board of directors have to do whatever they can

00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:04,720
to make sure that shareholders are not only not losing money but are increasing their

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
profits.

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,720
That's what shareholders are about.

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,070
Stakeholders are looking at other people in the company, and this is where you get the

00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,070
inclusiveness.

00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,440
If you're only thinking about shareholder value, how inclusive can you actually be?

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,180
That's why there's no money in it because you can't justify — there is data about

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,519
ROI return on investment when you have a very inclusive teams, and I'm sure if you work

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,131
on inclusive teams, you know that you have better ideas, you can create better, you can

00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:38,940
create something together that you couldn't create by yourself, but if your main thing

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:45,890
is about shareholder value, if giving something to inclusion and diversity and those shareholders

00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,980
don't see an immediate return on their value, you're not going to get that money.

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,509
So we're talking about stakeholder values.

00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:58,350
This is what the business model I believe in, and it's talking about considering those

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:05,350
who work for you, those who partner with you, those who buy from you, and those who invest

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,350
in you.

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,100
I have them in that order for a reason.

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,570
Your employees, the people who work for you are your most important asset.

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,920
Period.

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,820
They determine how any customer experience is going to be.

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:28,480
So you need to make sure that you have thought about how to improve the experiences of those

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,920
internal stakeholders.

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,910
And then you're going to go outside a bubble, and those are your partners, maybe your supply

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:41,980
chain, if you're making T-shirts, the company you choose to make your T-shirts, these are

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,910
the things that you need to think about because you might pick a company that has policies

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,290
that you don't believe in.

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,910
But you partner with them because you haven't thought about these things.

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,160
Also, who buys from you?

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,040
Everybody's not going to buy from you.

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,140
There are some clients you will not want, but you can't know that or be able to articulate

00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:10,560
that well if you have not made these determinations, or if you haven't thought about these things.

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,130
Everybody is running out here for this VC money.

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:23,240
Mail chimp was named — number-one company for 2017, and they've not taken a bit of venture

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:30,091
capital money before before when we talk about investing, we need to think, when we are talking

00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:35,990
about communities, your local JavaScript, who is investing their time in you?

00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,850
Who is sponsoring you?

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,140
Those are the four stakeholders you need to think about.

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:48,600
Going from a product to service focus to business-model focus takes time.

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,519
You've got to stop expect ing simple solutions to complex problems.

00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,430
This is what gets us in trouble.

00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:02,560
It takes intention which means I want to do something, but wanting to do it is not enough.

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,519
You have to have a strategy in place to make it happen.

00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:12,110
All are necessary in order to innovate, differentiate, and compete in the information age.

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,300
You do not have a business if you cannot, not in the information aiming, if you cannot

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,280
innovate and differentiate yourselves.

00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,170
There are two ways you can get competitive advantage through differentiation, and price.

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:30,240
I don't think anybody really wants to battle anybody on price.

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:38,649
When you differentiate your services and products, you can, this is really something, look at

00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:44,460
Louis Vuitton, nobody needs one of those bags but I see tons of them.

00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:52,380
All you need is a sack from the grocery store, but people have different ideas of what they

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,190
value.

00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:06,210
Building stakeholder focus is a proactive approach to addressing inclusion to diversity.

00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,310
Woof to have a plan.

00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,640
It has to be strategic because, when we don't do that, underrepresented and marginalised

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,610
individuals are harmed by our actions.

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:26,180
This is the reason I have a problem with stack overflow today.

00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,050
I have a serious problem that, for the last three years, their survey indicates that 92

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:37,110
per cent of their survey participants were white males between the ages of 18 to 34.

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,930
White males between the ages of 18 to 24, you're my target audience because you're the

00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,930
bottleneck.

00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,950
You're in the way.

00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,290
There is nothing wrong with you, I have nothing against you.

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,560
But you are in the way.

00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,940
What I don't like about the stack overflow issue is the fact that businesses are looking

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,170
at that as if that is a representation of the global community.

00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,180
It is not.

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,570
It's a representation of those individuals who feel safe enough to engage and gamify

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,940
stack overflow.

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,720
[Cheering and Applause].

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,810
I'm currently hearing that people are going on interviews and asking, "I need to see your

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,810
GitHub and stack overflow score."

00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,810
What?

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:29,660
What does that have about me doing my day to day job.

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,380
Because women, people of colour, people with disabilities, are not actively engaging on

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,100
stack overflow, they don't have scores.

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,380
It means these decisions by business leaders are impacting us financially.

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,830
And you really don't have a right to mess up my money.

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:54,630
Is so stop making these stupid decisions.

00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:00,880
So I'm going to take you from a process shifting from a product or service focus to a business-model

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
focus.

00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,680
Step one.

00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:10,070
I have now know clients imagine — imagine what the ideal stakeholder experience would

00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,080
look like.

00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:17,350
I don't have my clients talk about their product or service until several sessions later, because

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,350
that doesn't matter.

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,150
If you do this part right, you can pivot, change, do everything.

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,130
You should not be married to a product or service.

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,910
That's also what gets us in trouble, because we can't change it, and even though our customers,

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,891
all of our stakeholders are not saying this is working for me, stack overflow, you're

00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:41,380
holding on to this, and those who follow me know that I'm into stack overflow right now,

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:50,020
so I have a problem because they — is the hub in the wheel?

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:55,800
The hub of every developer community in the world.

00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:02,870
You cannot tell me, especially when we're talking about AI machine-learning and deep-learning,

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,940
that that code on that website is not biased.

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:14,930
So, you have people who don't feel safe enough to engage on that site, so they copy and paste

00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,930
the code.

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:21,150
At some point, there's going to be a tipping point where we have a problem.

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:29,761
So this process is not outlining, not outlining, so you're not saying step one, step two, you

00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:34,810
really want to get into the feel how you want your customers to feel when they come in contact

00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,810
with your organisation.

00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,360
It's not about product or services at this point.

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,790
What do you want them to feel when they come in contact with you?

00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:47,790
When they reach out to you and say, "I need help, because," how do you want them to feel

00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,980
through the whole process?

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,290
And this takes time.

00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,840
Some clients I have recently thought it was going to be because they're in El Salvador

00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,660
thought it would take them a few hours.

00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,211
It took them a week to get their assignment back to me, because you really have to think

00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:01,740
deeply about this.

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,210
It's time for you to tap into the emotions.

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,840
We go back to Louis Vuitton.

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,590
The only reason why people buy it is because there's an emotional attachment to that — that's

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:19,500
what high-priced goods are, they elicit an emotion in us.

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,350
You want to use adjectives, descriptive words.

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,690
This is ago an example I'm going to give you.

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,330
You have to create indicators.

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,800
So this is me.

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Oops.

00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Yes.

00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
So, define.

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,790
So my company, you want to put a company name, it has a commitment to.

00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:50,260
Kim Crayton has a commitment to positive change in the technology sector.

00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:56,590
Anybody who follows me knows that is what I do.

00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,410
So now you want to define your core values.

00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:06,370
My company is to promote positive organisational and community change in fun and engaging ways.

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,000
That's why I have the music, conferences and shirts.

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,020
This stuff is hard enough.

00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:18,240
I need people to feel safe and comfortable, and welcome to have these challenging, complex

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,880
conversations.

00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,840
So you want to know what that looks like, what that experience looks like.

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,770
Then you want to define your indicators.

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:34,550
For me, it is to get more clients, so that means to me, I will know that I have more

00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:39,210
clients because I'm meeting or exceeding my monthly financial goals.

00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,790
I'm getting attention because I have a significant growth in brand awareness.

00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:51,530
I'm getting more Twitter followers, for Instagram followers, getting people say do you want

00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,750
to be on my podcast?

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,770
And then I want data.

00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:00,770
I want to track client outcomes, so when I'm working with my personal clients, I want to

00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:07,081
make sure I provide them with a simple thing — a testimonial.

00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:12,420
All they have to do is fill in the blanks, at my conferences, a survey or something.

00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,100
I want to get that data.

00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,410
Then you want to apply it.

00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,910
You want to apply measurements.

00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:25,090
You cannot manage what you can not measure this X number of dollars per months by December

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,250
31st.

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,580
Get attention.

00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:36,140
Be a guest on X number of podcasts, or write in X number of publications by this time,

00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,740
and I will identify that.

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,000
And give data.

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,620
X number of testimonials, referrals, sponsorships.

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:48,580
These are things that I have identified so that I can measure myself against it.

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:55,100
So then I ask myself: what must we must we have reach this benchmark to know that we

00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,210
claim success.

00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,300
We can't say I got halfway there because you're not measuring.

00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,250
I say got halfway there but these are the reasons I only got halfway there, so this

00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,500
may be a success.

00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,480
You maybe only got halfway there because you had to pivot ahead and be a more successful

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,380
opportunity but you will not know that if you haven't sat down and written these things

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,380
out.

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,420
This step is where a deep — where you develop effective metrics for measuring your core

00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,510
values.

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:30,520
So, my core values again are to promote positive organisational community change in fun and

00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,640
engaging ways.

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,510
This is how you turn — because people like how do you get these adjectives.

00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:40,480
This is why code of conducts don't work all the time, because "be nice" — what does

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,580
that mean?

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,760
Everyone has a different idea of what be nice is.

00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,330
You need to figure out words that are measurable.

00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:53,000
I also don't like "harassment", because if you've not defined it in the beginning, some

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,400
people have a different idea of what harassment is.

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,020
That would lead to the MeToo movement.

00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:05,370
Then you want to test the indicators with your stakeholders, and you want to collect

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,350
data interest them data are the facts, but again, that's not enough.

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,300
You want their feedback, their feelings, and their reactions, so it is two ways of collecting

00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,300
data.

00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:19,650
You want to collect information, so you want to get that hard data, that quantitative data,

00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,960
but you also want to get that qualitative data, because, without both, you do not have

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,870
a complete picture.

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:33,130
And then you want to evaluate your measurements to determine if your benchmarks are not met.

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,660
This is where people mess up.

00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,910
You want to know why, if you did meet — what did you do?

00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,920
Write that stuff down.

00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:47,600
If you did not talk about it and write that stuff down.

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,510
Use knowledge from evaluation and testing to refine the process, and you're going to

00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,920
iterate, and tell people as you iterate your product or service, you need to be iterating

00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:03,300
your culture and values, need to be testing, figuring out is this working for you do we

00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,450
need to change that?

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:10,010
You need to be doing it just like a sprint.

00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,570
And then you need to standardise it.

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:16,851
Once you have something that's concrete, a little, I mean, more concrete, because it's

00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:21,660
never going to be concrete, you need to create former processes on the knowledge from the

00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:28,970
evaluations, you need to adopt explicit language and explicit things you can write documentation.

00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,740
Documentation is the best ways, one of the first ways that you can be more inclusive

00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,840
in your communities.

00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,400
You need to be writing documentation, in particular if you have customers that use that to create,

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,890
or use that to answer questions, your documentation is not a one-stop thing, it is a continuous

00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,910
cycle.

00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,630
You need to share tacit knowledge.

00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:55,230
Tacit knowledge is what you turn information into personal knowledge, and so, if I'm doing

00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:00,280
something, and I have a task, and I've done it a few times, now I have my own way of doing

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
that.

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,750
You need to not only capture that but that needs to be shared throughout the organisation,

00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:12,210
because in an information economy, it is that tacit knowledge that will allow you to differentiate

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,800
and be competitive if the . Not this book knowledge or these binders.

00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,880
That's not the information you need that's going to make you competitive.

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,000
Core values should be inform all organisational decisions, and we're going to show you what

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,800
I mean in a minute.

00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,390
Remember that this is an ongoing process.

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,470
The decisions that are the result of this process should be seen, not seen as immutable

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,600
or rigid.

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,480
Organisation of leaders should plan to re view whether stakeholders factors have changed,

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,270
at least, at a minimum, two times a year, because you need to be shifting.

00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:56,400
When leaders create organisations around well-defined and tested core values that consider the needs

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,470
of all stakeholders, and have processes in place to monitor progress, again, it is all

00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:07,520
stakeholders' measurements, they are less likely to discover at some point in the future

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,040
that they've been nurturing a toxic environment.

00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,400
This is my first example.

00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,050
What I talk about my core values, what are the changes of this community in a positive

00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,910
way, and a fun way, right?

00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,510
The first example, this fits into my core values.

00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,080
I have Cause a Scene merchandise.

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:35,320
It's — I'm going to be honest with you, I don't ever remember what I said in my talks.

00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,050
So people come back and say, "You sound like that's good, I'm going to write that down."

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:44,890
So I have several items on this website, because, again, I have a problem with people not wanting

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,230
to pay for this.

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,700
I just like you go to work every day, you expect a cheque, the things I do, I expect

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,230
to get paid for.

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,130
The second example — yes, wooh!

00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,130
Exactly.

00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,600
The second example is the conference.

00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,430
So the conference is all about — again, I'm an educator, and a special needs certified,

00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:10,200
so I'm used to working with students to demonstrate how to do something.

00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,240
So I'm really sick and tired of people talking about, "We can't find underrepresented and

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,360
marginalised people to speak at our conferences."

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,730
You don't have an excuse any more because I'm showing you how to do it.

00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:27,240
Again, my conference is Monday night, I'm sorry, I use the English thing, because I

00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,090
informed you think I'm talking 7.30 in the morning.

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,160
Heck, no.

00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,210
It's 7.30 pm until 11 pm.

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:40,370
It's not in the morning.

00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:46,500
The next example of me using my core values to make decisions is my podcast.

00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,030
Just launched on Wednesday, this past Wednesday.

00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,910
It is the raw deal Holyfield.

00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,220
We're talking about everything, because we need to have these conversations so we can

00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,210
move through them been it's not until we have the challenging conversations, and white men,

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,150
I'm going to tell you: if you're feeling uncomfortable, you're only feeling this much discomfort.

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,400
I walk around in this every single day.

00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,540
If I can deal, you can.

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,530
[Cheering and Applause].

00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:19,850
And the fourth example is the leadership training, the coaching that I'm doing, I'm doing some

00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,380
consulting while I'm here.

00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,140
And this is — I'm doing — so this is also showing you and giving you a demonstration

00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:34,680
of how I've used my core values to dictate how I get so my stakeholders and my customers.

00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
So, thank you.

00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,600
