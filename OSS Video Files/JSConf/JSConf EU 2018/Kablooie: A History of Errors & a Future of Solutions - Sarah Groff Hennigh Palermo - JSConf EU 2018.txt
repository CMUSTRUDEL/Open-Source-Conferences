Publication date: 2018-07-10
Playlist: JSConf EU 2018
Description: 
	Errors and debugging are the bane of a programmer’s life — and the source of many jokes, Twitter rants, and midnight breakdowns. But how often do we consider error themselves: not as obstacles but as entities?

This talk will cover a short history of errors in computer science and how errors work in Javascript itself, before looking at different approaches to reducing errors — maybe even by embracing them.
