Title: From You Can't to You Can: The Welcoming Nature of Javascript - Tejas Kumar - JSConf EU 2018
Publication date: 2018-06-18
Playlist: JSConf EU 2018
Description: 
	This talk explores the ease-of-adoption that makes Javascript a truly unique language that is hospitable to developers across all levels of experience: beginners, intermediates, and experts through the eyes of a chronically ill engineer who never thought heâ€™d amount to much.

Hi!

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,059
How are all of you?

00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:14,249
Are we well?

00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:15,249
Was it a good break?

00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,249
Did we get food?

00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,310
Are we refreshed?

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,310
Yes?

00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,310
Really?

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,310
Let's try that again.

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,310
Yes?

00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,310
There we go.

00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,310
Excellent.

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,160
My name is Tejas, that's pronounced by contagious.

00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,580
And I make that easy.

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,370
Is your name I get a lot of mispronunciations.

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,039
It is like contagious.

00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,399
Don't worry, I'm not sick.

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,050
I'm not going to give you anything besides hopefully a good talk about JavaScript and

00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,530
its welcoming nature.

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,750
Day to day I work at a data science platform called Contiamo.

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:59,559
And we build very rich, expressive user interfaces that interact with machine learning and AI

00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,950
to help users make better decisions, essentially build decision tools.

00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,810
What in the world?

00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,870
I'm here today to talk to us about JavaScript.

00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,430
Do I need to do something?

00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:23,470
Especially how JavaScript as a language is is helpful and welcoming and more hospitable

00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,970
and accommodating to newcomers across the board from beginners to intermediates to more

00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,119
advanced engineers.

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,880
I'd really like to get the slides fixed.

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,509
It's throwing me off a bit.

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,790
Let's see.

00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,509
Maybe should I not touch anything?

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,579
Right.

00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:44,659
Okay.

00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,530
The tech guys are on the way.

00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,380
I guess I can just continue talking.

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,840
So, where were we?

00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Today we're going to talk about JavaScript.

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,390
The title of the talk is from you can't to you can: The welcoming nature of JavaScript.

00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,010
From you can't to you can: The welcoming nature of JavaScript.

00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:11,250
Have you ever felt like JavaScript has been described or in some ways dismissed or reduced

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,550
as kind of a toy language?

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,040
As kind of it's a little bit brittle, it's a little bit shaky.

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Oh!

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
We have slides.

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Excuse me.

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,240
That's cool.

00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,010
Can we hear it for [ Applause ]

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,260
All right.

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,260
Woohoo!

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,770
Thank you, sir.

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,880
The title, it's called you can't to you can: The welcoming nature of JavaScript.

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
Right?

00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,940
And so, we want to talk about how JavaScript through various language syntax features is

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,850
just something that is so approachable and hospitable and then talk about my experience.

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,780
So, make my point about JavaScript maybe being a language that some consider brittle and

00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,410
maybe not as robust, I would like to share with you a quote from a friend of mine.

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,010
This quote and I think a good summation of how we think about JavaScript.

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,010
Seriously?

00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,710
There we go.

00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:12,140
This is a heavy paraphrase of what a friend of mine has said.

00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,880
And it's heavy because it was way worse.

00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
The original text.

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,480
Let me tell you.

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,710
He's a scholar engineer and really talented.

00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:26,580
But fact of the matter is, some of the more I'd say opinionated languages have in opinion

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,050
about JavaScript.

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,640
My goal today is to examine some points of criticism about JavaScript and say, hey, maybe

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,370
that is not a bug.

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,370
But maybe that's a feature.

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,540
Do you understand?

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,660
Are you with me?

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,290
Maybe that's not a weakness, maybe it's a strength.

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,290
Maybe it's not a disadvantage, but an advantage.

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,770
I want to talk to us particularly about four things.

00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,510
And then if we have some time at the end, I would like to kind of share just a bit of

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,670
my story and experience with JavaScript.

00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,220
With that, I would like to for two seconds give us some context for those who haven't

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,970
heard talk two seconds about the history of JavaScript.

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,750
So, and in the beginning the web platform was really immature.

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,750
Or just beginning.

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,680
And, you know, the future of the web at the time I think it was the '80s, I'm not even

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,799
sure, was foreseen as something that would be powered by Java, right?

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,370
Java applets and browsers, web 2.0.

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,420
Wow, how cool?

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:35,980
Meanwhile, Netscape, Brendan Eich invented this language that would be powerful and see

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,530
the web forward.

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,580
I read that this language took three weeks to come up with.

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,010
And I've heard that it is it was a rush to delivery.

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,330
Now, how many of us have written rush to delivery code?

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:56,760
And I don't even need we know what that's like, right?

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:03,540
I think while some would say that part of JavaScript is maybe what makes it weak or

00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,290
unique, I would say that may have been one of the happiest accidents if it was an accident

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,150
in the history of our time.

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,880
And that's the reason I put the slide up there.

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,760
Now, let's get to the four things.

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,840
Number one.

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,070
I can already see some of the TypeScript people in the room judging me.

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:32,430
But let me tell you, I think dynamic typing with JavaScript is something that is weak

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:39,710
and that creates brittle applications, I have honestly not seen a more welcoming construct.

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,400
Mainly because static typing as it stands is extra syntax.

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,770
And there's a lot to keep track of.

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:53,020
I mean, this is from feedback from friends of mine who were journalists, architects,

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,450
graphic designers with not a lot of web Dev or computer science experience.

00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,870
All of them wanting a change from what they studied.

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,090
Guess what language they found a home?

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,180
Not TypeScript.

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,480
JavaScript by its nature of dynamic typing was the language of choice.

00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,580
I believe this is the reason.

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,139
I believe through the dynamic nature of the language, what you get is the ability to go

00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:26,480
from zero to, oh, my gosh, it's working, in a fraction of the time it would normally take.

00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,270
I would also say that dynamic typing is educational.

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,770
Absolutely educational.

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,320
And what I mean by that is it teaches you the need for static typing.

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,460
Right?

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,870
How many of you have been bitten by implicit coercion?

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,120
You try to do a computation and you get a nan, what can occur with the explicit JavaScript

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,520
conversion because of the dynamic type system.

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,800
What happens is really cool and something that I believe is unique to the JavaScript

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,360
community.

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,150
JavaScript as a syntax I would say is really, really, really friendly for the reasons we

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,150
discussed.

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,030
But I would say that's two sides of the same coin.

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,830
The other side being the helpful, supportive, inclusive community that I'm looking at right

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,370
now.

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,720
If someone's bitten by a typing error in JavaScript, or just a computation that's impossible, what's

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,910
the next step?

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,960
You turn to StackOverflow or GitHub or something.

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,770
Or discord and you find a community.

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,480
That's because you're changing this thing.

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,139
Whatever the cause may be.

00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:34,490
And you learn.

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:42,110
I grew up in a school setting where information was ingested and then regurgitated practically

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,669
and professionally.

00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,650
So, you learn things.

00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,900
And then you just do it in your job.

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,639
That's just the way it's always been.

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,770
That's what we have learned.

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:57,200
I would argue when you have bitten by a few dynamic type problems, you learn the need

00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,780
and the importance of it and use it wisely.

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,930
Number two.

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,180
This is a quote that should not have happened.

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,240
We'll talk about that in a second.

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,830
Number two.

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:18,130
This is an excerpt bit author of a book called JavaScript: The good Parts.

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,160
The author is one of the greatest contributors for the community.

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:30,820
He worked for Yahoo! and created a UI kit, and this is what he says about JavaScript

00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,820
APIs from the browser and from Node.

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:40,430
JavaScript is coupled with the DOM, a horrendous API, before NodeJS.

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,090
A lot of confusion about where JavaScript ends, and the DOM begins.

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,980
While I would agree with the second part, I don't see why the DOM is particularly a

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
horrendous API.

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,880
In fact, I would say the DOM is the reason I have a job.

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,560
The DOM is the reason for many of our careers here.

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,850
Especially if you work with like React or VUE or something.

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,790
We have a React fan!

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,400
VUE fan.

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,150
We have a UI fan.

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,250
[ Laughter ] I would argue APIs, at least for me and other

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,310
engineers who have started have been just these building blocks, right?

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:25,250
From which you can show a pop up or a modal dialogue or accept user input using window.prompt.

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,810
You can fetch data using the fetch API.

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,810
It's declared.

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:36,100
There was a talk at CSS Conf with declarative CSS where it's a declarative algorithm.

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,900
The APIs give you this tool set in the browser and in Node that gets you up and running really

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
fast.

00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,940
It's part of the welcoming nature of JavaScript.

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:53,380
I was willing to admit for me as a junior engineer, I tried to use window and Node.

00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,960
It gave me an error.

00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,860
Window is not a function you can use it in JavaScript?

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,839
I confused it for syntax.

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,400
But, again, the community shown, and I learned, and I was able to learn.

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,060
In fact, I have spent a lot of time talking about APIs.

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,730
And really this talk is largely community based.

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,360
It's not very technical.

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,070
But I thought, you know, since I'm talking about APIs, I might as well use one.

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,250
I wanted to build something.

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,650
What I ended up doing was thinking about what can I build?

00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:36,880
And I thought about, well, you know, I really like talking in case you can't tell, and I

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,490
really like people.

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,710
And I don't want to have to hide behind the podium and change the slides.

00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,710
Or use a clicker.

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,350
I just thought I could build something that as I'm talking, it would follow me through

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,230
my slides.

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,730
And that's basically what's been happening this whole time.

00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,350
Hello.

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,030
My name [ Applause ]

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:07,370
It's just the JavaScript ecosystem is so rich with these APIs.

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,860
I built this thing.

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,430
I put it on GitHub.

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,029
It's called Praise.

00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:16,600
And it's very it's open source.

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,370
It's very experimental.

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,339
Please do not use it in production.

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,220
It's only supported in Chrome.

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,120
But it's literally just to make a point.

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,290
And that point is, JavaScript is welcoming.

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,510
Praise was the praise.

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,670
See?

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,980
It's experimental.

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,050
That was the projects.

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,200
APIs how long did this take?

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,590
I sat next to my girlfriend, this beautiful young lady here.

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,149
Took me four hours on a Saturday afternoon.

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,050
I was at it, I made bindings for it.

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,050
Why not?

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,050
All of that's on GitHub.

00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,550
Number three.

00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:01,260
JavaScript, I have been heard JavaScript criticized as an unopinionated language.

00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,580
You can write whatever style of code you want and that's the language.

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:12,760
You can write class based, object oriented, polymorphic, inherited style code, or stateless

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,570
functional immutable code with monads flying around that looks like math.

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,750
And there's no real it doesn't push you into a style.

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,010
I have heard in this from Golang engineers.

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:34,170
If you peek under the hood of JavaScript, it

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,250
is, in fact, opinionated.

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,480
I have written object oriented, polymorphic inherited style code, and there's a use case

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,010
for that.

00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:50,860
But you get functions and objects and things that use prototype delegation.

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,470
And so, this would lead me to think, JavaScript is kind of sort of leading towards more of

00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,800
a functional language.

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
You get first class functions.

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,740
You get recursion out of the box.

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
There's a star there.

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,200
I know, I know not everything is a function.

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,339
But you catch my drift.

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:12,050
And then in a team, you can kind of conventionalize the other functional best practices.

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,200
You can have pure functions, immutable data structures.

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,710
And go on and on and on.

00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,380
I would say JavaScript is easier this way.

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,290
When I tried writing code kind of Java style, what ended up happening is I felt like I was

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,100
going up an escalator that was moving down.

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,610
Are you tracking with me?

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,850
It felt like I was fighting the language.

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:41,650
The way I use the language, the way I would say it was designed, things got a lot easier.

00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:47,680
The last thing I'll say is really, I mean, it's there was a point of controversy for

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,060
a little bit last year.

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,500
I'm to the going to say much about it.

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,440
Because in my opinion it is incredible.

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,500
It is the greatest mechanic a compiler can have.

00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,100
I guarantee you.

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,350
Lastly, we'll talk about my slides don't change.

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,350
It's experimental.

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,010
Don't use it in production.

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,830
We'll talk about this.

00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:17,380
Automatic semicolon insertion is such a blessing for beginning developers.

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,360
Have you worked in another language and left off the semicolon and the compiler yells at

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
you?

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Why?

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,560
Am I not allowed to make a mistake?

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Gosh.

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,130
Yet JavaScript, if it's someone just learning, what does it do?

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,350
It just says, I see what you're trying to do.

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,930
I got you.

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:46,420
If there's one thing you get from this talk, let it be that JavaScript is your bro.

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,970
Or sis.

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,060
Or whatever, gender neutral.

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,750
And so, those are the four things that I think really help JavaScript be this language that

00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,710
is so easy to adopt across the board.

00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,060
About ASI, I'll say one more thing.

00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:07,640
As I've learned and grown into a more seasoned engineer, I would recommend leave your semicolons

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,140
on.

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,400
Honestly, it's good as a starting out step to make have the optional.

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,190
But you're fighting the compiler under the hood by not having them.

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,650
Now that that's out of the way, let's shift gears a little bit.

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,080
And I would like to talk about my journey with JavaScript.

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,870
Because you see in many ways it is a journey of from you can't to you can.

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,920
I was born with a disability.

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,190
I was born with a disease.

00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,200
As I said in the beginning, I'm not contagious, don't worry.

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,450
But it's still a disease.

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,110
And it is life threatening.

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,940
And I have been told I have the worst kind of it.

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,260
Basically, the condition is called hemophilia.

00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,820
Do not confuse that with homophobia.

00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:00,420
But hemophilia is a disease where once I start bleeding I do not stop until I lose all my

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,440
blood and die.

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,970
And so, I mean, I can see some of you engineers in the room go, well, then, just don't get

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,209
cut.

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:09,209
Problem solved, dude.

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,240
It's not rocket science.

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,800
But let me tell you, internal bleeding is something that is far more common than external

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
bleeding.

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,030
And so, if you've walked today, if you came with a backpack.

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,829
I guarantee you you have started bleeding into your niece or ankles or elbows.

00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:26,829
But you stop.

00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:28,560
So, you don't even notice.

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:35,910
I've been in the emergency room literally by opening a heavy door.

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,440
I have by climbing stairs.

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,270
I've literally spent weeks in the emergency room.

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:44,490
And so, this you can see by this how you can get a lot of you can'ts.

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,970
Am I right?

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,500
You can't play sports.

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,220
You can't ride a bicycle.

00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,470
I have a bicycle.

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,339
To this day I have no idea what to do with it.

00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,649
It just sits there.

00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:55,649
I probably should sell it.

00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:56,649
Who wants to buy a bike?

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:00,459
You want it?

00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:02,370
Really?

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,370
We'll talk after.

00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,289
I so, there's a lot of you can'ts.

00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:11,929
And that started to change when we brother, who is healthy, he went to an HTML class.

00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:14,480
And when I was 8 years old, he came home, and he showed me.

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,629
He was like, look what I learned.

00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:17,299
He wasn't as interested.

00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,319
But I was like, are you kidding me?

00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,899
I can make a UI?

00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:24,540
What I was so interested.

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,600
What ended up happening was he would go to school and my parents would go to work and

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,470
I would be alone at home all day every day most of the year.

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,820
And an entire school year I would attend 19 days of school.

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,580
The rest of the time I'm alone at home doing what?

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,539
Well, there's so many games you can play and cartoons you can watch.

00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:50,409
And candy you can eat until you get bored.

00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:53,799
And when you're bored, I've learned, you do what interests you.

00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,009
And for me, this was code.

00:17:55,009 --> 00:18:00,260
So, I started writing some code and made a couple websites as a child.

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
I was in magazines.

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,210
If there's child making websites in a small town, people hear.

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,830
I was in a few magazines and then my parents, god bless them, they did the best thing they

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,830
need to do.

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:17,359
They put me in an advanced program for object oriented C++ at age 10.

00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,369
At age 10.

00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:20,639
I still have the diploma.

00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:22,740
And I'm like, I don't remember any of it.

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Right?

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,830
As a 10 year old I'm sitting there with all kinds of includes at the top of the file.

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,350
#include.cone io.h.

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,159
Is there ice cream in the program?

00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,950
I had no idea.

00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,390
The compiler would yell at me for everything.

00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:46,359
As a 10 year old, I'm sitting there going, why is it yelling at me?

00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,789
I'm writing code.

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:50,100
Is this another thing I can't do?

00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,110
I thought programming was my thing.

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,679
People have applauded me.

00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:55,720
You can't, you can't, you can't.

00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,510
And now I thought I could.

00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:08,460
Eventually I got back into JavaScript as it evolved and things like Prototype and query,

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,710
and things started picking up traction.

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,450
And I won an award for web development in my home town.

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,600
And not long after a job came and another job.

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,279
And I'm interviewing all of a sudden for a position in Germany.

00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,279
Move here.

00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:27,279
And now, let me tell you, I have access to the best health care I have ever received.

00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,279
I go running.

00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,490
I lift weights, I've climbed mountains.

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,909
I go rafting in the river.

00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:33,020
It's insane.

00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:42,649
And all of a sudden most of the "You can'ts" have become the" You can" largely because

00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:43,649
thank you.

00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,649
Yeah.

00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,740
You can go for it.

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:54,090
[ Applause ] Largely largely because of the welcoming nature

00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,090
of JavaScript.

00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,320
Let me tell you, we have a language that is inclusive.

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,610
That is tolerant.

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:07,330
That will not entangle your mind with intersection types and discriminated unions and generics.

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,330
While these are good things.

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,350
There is a time and a place.

00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,100
We have a language that is inclusive.

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,220
That is easy.

00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,359
On the other side of the coin, we have a community can we hear it for the community?

00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,440
[ Applause ]

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,239
We have a community, man, is it inclusive?

00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,999
Look around you.

00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:32,809
This looks like the United Nations here, right?

00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,110
We have a community that is inclusive.

00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,110
That is tolerant.

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,539
That is mostly vegan.

00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,850
I'll leave you I will leave you with this.

00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,009
I've thoroughly enjoyed our time together.

00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:49,419
I've thoroughly enjoyed working even with the organizers of this conference to make

00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,070
it a wonderful time.

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,570
They have given me a wonderful time more I haven't organized anything.

00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,890
Don't get me wrong.

00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,240
But I'll leave you with this.

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,140
I think we have the potential to make the language what it is how many of you have heard

00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,110
the TC39 talk?

00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,110
Right.

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,110
Exactly.

00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,009
TC39 shapes the language and it is an open standard.

00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,649
It is an open source project with proposals.

00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:15,649
Contribute.

00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,649
Get involved.

00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:20,539
You have the power to make the language what you want it to be.

00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:26,700
If you don't want to code, you have the power to make the community what it is.

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,700
You have the power.

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,830
I leave up the slide for Praise if any of you are interested.

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,830
It should change.

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,609

00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,270
That's my talk.

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,770
