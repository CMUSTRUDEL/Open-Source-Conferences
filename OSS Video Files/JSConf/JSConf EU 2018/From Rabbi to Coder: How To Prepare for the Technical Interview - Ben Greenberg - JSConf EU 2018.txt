Publication date: 2018-07-31
Playlist: JSConf EU 2018
Description: 
	After ten years serving as a rabbi throughout the United States including as the campus rabbi of Harvard University, I transitioned to being a developer. How does a rabbi prepare for the technical interview? What are the skills needed to succeed? This presentation is for anyone who has entered software development from non-traditional backgrounds (i.e. music, literature, education, sports, journalism and more). Come to be inspired and to grow in your confidence and skillset.

That's not full screen.

00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,479
But it's close.

00:00:02,479 --> 00:00:05,450
Well, you get a whole experience there.

00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,670
Some of my desktop background.

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,670
Okay.

00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,670
Cool.

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,670
Hello, everyone.

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,320
So, I'll start off by telling you a quick story.

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,920
There was a rabbi who also would give sermons from a pulpit kind of like this on Saturday

00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
mornings.

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,980
And he gave the best sermons.

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,140
They were† they rocked the house!

00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,500
And they were lasting sometimes 15 minutes, 20 minutes.

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,250
Sometimes if they're really good, a half hour.

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,820
Really get into it, the spirit was moving him.

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,450
And people loved it.

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,840
One Saturday morning at the reception after services one of the members came up to him,

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,969
for lack of a name, call him Mr.†Cohen.

00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:47,129
And Mr.†Cohen says I run a daytime talk show.

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,090
I would love you to be on the talk show.

00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,180
Today, it was so inspiring, I think it will just move the audience.

00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,780
Can you come on to the talk show on Tuesday morning?

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,350
And the rabbi says, I guess I'll do that.

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,350
Sure.

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,350
Why not.

00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,350
But there's only one problem, Mr.†Cohen.

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,340
He says you speak so powerfully, but the slot is only for two minutes.

00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,500
Two minutes.

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,070
It's a TV show.

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,540
It's snippets.

00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,640
And the rabbi says, no problem.

00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,610
I can bring that down to two minutes.

00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:25,390
And Cohen said if you can do that for the talk show, can you do that every week?

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,530
I know I'm the penultimate talk before lunch, but I don't know about you, but in my community,

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,149
food and lunch is a big deal.

00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:40,680
I understand if your stomach says you're hungry and try to be concise and keep to 25 minutes.

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,590
Although, a fair warning, rabbis can be a little verbose.

00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,229
We can be a little longwinded, but I will try and keep it down.

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:52,869
So, the talk for today is preparing for the technical interview.

00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:57,060
And I think it's a really important one for people who, like me, came into coding, came

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,100
into this field from backgrounds that were not the traditional backgrounds.

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,890
Meaning I didn't graduate with a computer science degree, a logic degree, a math degree.

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:13,420
I majored in psychology and minored in political science and a lot of theology.

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,640
How do you prepare for these conversations when you don't come from that place?

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,300
So, just first, a little bit about who I am.

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,240
So, I† this work† I was born and raised in San Diego.

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,610
It's a beautiful city at the very edge of California right on the border of Mexico.

00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,660
A great childhood.

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,220
A lot of time at the beach.

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,220
A lot of fun.

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,750
And I also was a bit of a nerd in San Diego.

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,470
And so, I helped to create a couple meetings.

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,129
This is from 2000, I think, this website.

00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,390
This was the San Diego 2600 meeting.

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,630
Does anybody remember 2600 Magazine?

00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,630
I see a hand.

00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,630
2600 Magazine.

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,980
2600 Magazine was like a hacker magazine.

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,400
It was cool in the '90s, early 2000s.

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,670
And they had like meetings throughout the world.

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,790
I created the San Diego chapter of the 2600 meeting.

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,790
This was our website.

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,770
And it just recently got a facelift.

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,250
Capital W, capital S. That tells you so much about the time.

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,070
I was up there, I was Skalore.

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,510
I liked ska music.

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,620
I was a major nerd.

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:35,160
And in the 2600 meeting we created Tor:Con.

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,920
A computer info sec conference.

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,740
It was started in 1999.

00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,460
It's in the 20th year next year.

00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:51,210
And now, now there's three, San Diego, Seattle, TorCamp in Washington State, five days.

00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:58,450
And TorWorld, a hacker cruise in Antarctica.

00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,820
I was about 15 or 16 when we created this conference.

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:08,840
I many parents had to sign off on the room reservations at the UCSD Price center where

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
we had the event.

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,650
It's now at the convention center.

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:18,090
This was sent to listservs.

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,200
This was 1999, southern California's only† all caps!

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:32,110
Comprehensive interactive, a comprehensive, interactive and enjoyable conference to the

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,780
western United States to make people aware of the importance of computer security.

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,900
And it cost a whopping 35 bucks to come to the conference.

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,400
Now it's a little more expensive in the 20th year.

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,710
But it was $35.

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,570
And so, after that, from my childhood in San Diego and being a bit involved in computers

00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,490
I moved to New York.

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,140
So, from the sunny San Diego to New York.

00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,850
And that's what it looks like all year if you have never been there.

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,850
Believe me.

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,960
That's New York City.

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,310
And I went to New York to a small liberal arts Jewish college in Queens.

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,020
In the neighborhood of Flushing, New York.

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,660
Anybody been to Flushing?

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,900
Flushing is awesome.

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,000
It's one of the most diverse neighborhoods I think in the United States.

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,100
It's an awesome place.

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,580
But I went to the opposite of a diverse experience.

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,560
Allmale, ultra-orthodox Jewish college.

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,650
From 9:00 in the morning to 6:00 at night in religious studies and 6:00 to 9 p.m. in

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,780
college.

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,900
And 911 back in religious studies.

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,460
So, I had a lot of free time.

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,730
I was hanging out in New York all the time.

00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,940
I barely left from the dorm to the school back to the dorm to the school.

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:54,960
And a couple years into my college experience, a magazine in San Diego reached out to me

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,110
for this really tacky article.

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,770
And I just want to show one quick quote about what I was actually going.

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,960
Graphics, what people think you're doing versus what you're actually doing in life.

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,140
So, then this article from 2003, they're like, my mind wandered off to Ben Greenberg having

00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,660
really gone to school.

00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,860
Maybe he hadn't!

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, no.

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,540
But this was what I was actually doing.

00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:27,210
I was studying all day, a book of† many, many books of Jewish thought and law written

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:36,900
in Aramaic, a wonderful Hebrew language spoke†in Syria and in the Jewish community.

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,090
Studied that.

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,570
And once I was a rabbi, I was doing stuff like this.

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,500
Talking about matzah and holding it up.

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,710
Every rabbi has this.

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,250
It was important.

00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:00,910
I was leading this in Chicago on the topic of gun violence.

00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,930
If you're not from the States, it's regrettably a major issue.

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,960
I was at that time a community organizer in Chicago.

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,840
That's what I was actually doing.

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,870
I wasn't doing anything else.

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,170
I had actually gone to the school.

00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:21,890
And fast forward ten years and I decided I wanted to have a change in pace.

00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,419
And I at my ten-year mark in my career I said, you know, I could either keep on doing this

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:27,419
for life.

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,020
I could go back to being what I really love, which is a nerd.

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,660
And I went to Flatiron School.

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,040
A boot camp in New York City.

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,620
It's now part of a reworked family, via international coworking space.

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,230
And at the school I met a lot of people like me.

00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:49,480
I met graphic designers and musicians and artists and teachers and lawyers and sales

00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,640
people, and, yes, rabbis.

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,790
In fact, my colleague at the company I work at now who is a developer who sits right behind

00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:02,600
me is also a former rabbi who went to the Flatiron School and we went together.

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
We're not the only ones.

00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,410
In fact, we have a whole Slack channel just for rabbis turned developers.

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,000
The conversations are fascinating.

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,550
It's a mix of Hebrew and English and Yiddish all the time.

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,550
It's awesome.

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,010
If you want to know coding terminology in Yiddish, we can talk later.

00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,520
And we transitioned to coding for a lot of reasons.

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,620
We did it because we love the ability to create.

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,400
Coding was incredibly technical.

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,830
It's a highly, highly technical field.

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,760
It's an incredibly creative field.

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,760
And for those of us who come from other creative professions, whether it's art or somewhere

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,010
else, you get to exercise that part of your brain all the time as a programmer.

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,440
In different ways, in totally different modalities.

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,089
But you still get to create all the time.

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:52,570
And we also love it because of jobs.

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,970
There's a lot of jobs as a programmer.

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,820
New York City, there are tons of programming jobs.

00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,820
It is awesome.

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,750
When you have a family to support, it's even better.

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,110
And we love it because of the excitement of learning.

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,240
You never stop learning as a programmer.

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,860
Actually, reminds me of my education.

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:14,400
It never ends, every time you see a word, what does it mean?

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,490
Another JavaScript framework, how can I pick up that?

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,680
It never stops.

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,870
And we love it because of jobs.

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,570
Did I say that already?

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,930
I think I did.

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,650
We love the fact that we can make an impact.

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,610
Working at whatever kind of company you work at.

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,080
I work at a financial services company, if you work at a nonprofit, you can make a difference.

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,390
When it's a good day, not every day is a good day, but on a good day, you can say I have

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,510
done something.

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,260
Quantitatively done something.

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,300
I started here and ended here.

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,410
And there's something powerful about that.

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,980
And we love jobs.

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,990
And the work cultures.

00:09:52,990 --> 00:10:01,080
My car had an issue, I went to the coffee shop and somewhere else and wasn't home.

00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,140
And those who work remotely, I'm only a little jealous of you.

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,940
We love the fact you can take your work with you.

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,779
And, of course, there's some down sides to that as well.

00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:17,220
But the idea that you don't have to be tethered to a desk all day or all night.

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,130
And we also have jobs.

00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,130
Yes.

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,600
And did I mention jobs?

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Jobs are awesome.

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,010
And I put that there several times not only to be funny but because, yes, this is a great

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,790
career for people looking for something exciting, something you can make an impact, something

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,399
with remote work culture, and you can create and a lot of potential to actually take care

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,580
of yourself, take care of your family and to be economically secure which in this world

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,500
we really can't take for granted.

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,450
And so, in the boot camp process, first comes the learning.

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,089
And the learning is awesome.

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:53,529
It's hard to describe how awesome the learning is.

00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:59,210
You start from†nothing† I mean, the last time I coded was in Perl.

00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,520
And JavaScript was not really a thing in 1997.

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,570
And so, you start learning everything anew, essentially.

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,570
And it never ends.

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,530
It's like an endless sea of functions and methods.

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:18,190
And I like the gems of Ruby and the snakes of Python and all these things and it's so

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,190
awesome.

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,160
And then when you're ready, whether you finished a boot camp or you're selftaught and feel

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,779
like you're ready to get out into the job market.

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:33,010
Polish the resume and turn the nontech experience into a resume that won't get thrown out by

00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,050
the filters.

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,610
Polish the resume.

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,220
The cultural interviews.

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,010
Why do you want to work here?

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,580
Because you want to pay me.

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:50,330
And you get past the cultural conversations and then you get to the white board.

00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:55,950
And the white board can be absolutely terrifying if you're anyone.

00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,950
Anyone.

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,220
Whether you come from a CS background or you don't come from a CS background.

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:06,560
Whether you have done this for a long time or the first day, it's a terrifying experience.

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,390
And it's even more so, I don't know your experience if you come from a CS background.

00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,960
I know my experience.

00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,660
If you don't, it's a nightmare.

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,410
There's multiple points why it's challenging.

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,030
One is at the boot camp, whatever boot camp you went to, chances are you learned how to

00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,320
do things.

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,490
Maybe you learned React, JavaScript, you learned a Ruby is a fun one to learn at boot camps.

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,020
You learn how to code, right?

00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,399
But you don't necessarily learn the algorithms.

00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,630
You don't learn about data structures.

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,839
You don't learn about the things that you would learn if you go to a fouryear traditional

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:45,839
CS degree.

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:53,740
And yet oftentimes in front of the white board and all you have is that marker and the eraser

00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,459
and a bunch of eyes intently staring at you and watching you.

00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,000
They're asking you what kind of questions?

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,910
They're often asking you questions about data structures.

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,350
Or they're asking algorithmic questions.

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,850
They're not asking you to create a React component on the white board.

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:14,330
They're not asking you to create a function that does X, Y or Z.

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,720
Even the fun ones, palindrome functions.

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,519
Those are fun.

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,519
They're not asking those.

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,740
They're asking typically algorithmic questions.

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,770
Which you don't prepare for.

00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:30,820
What you do all day when you're not interviewing, I had in my backpack a tiny white board and

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
I took everywhere.

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,120
In between picking up kids from daycare or at the coffee shop, I had the wait board out

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,080
and I was practicing and practicing and practicing and practicing algorithmic questions.

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,170
And I had that big book.

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,890
You know the big book I'm talking about?

00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,690
Cracking the coding interview book.

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:53,420
And it simultaneously freaked me out and freaked me out.

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,550
Basically.

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,380
And I just practiced all† I looked a little crazy, you know, sitting in Starbucks with

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,480
a white board writing things that kind of looked like English but not really English.

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
What is that guy doing?

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
Do I need to be worried?

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,070
And so that's what I did.

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:16,640
What I want to do with our time, the remaining time is talk about how we can go from this

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,630
to this in this experience.

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,130
And I'm not going to solve it.

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:27,730
And it's not necessarily going to go from† all the way from this all the way to that.

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:34,440
But hopefully go from like a total nightmare to not as freaked out might be the goal.

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,339
And these things come from my own experiences.

00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,769
Just things that helped me to prepare.

00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:41,769
General principles.

00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:44,480
So, we're going to talk about some of these general principles.

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,089
And then we're going to apply them to one example.

00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:51,370
A relatively easy example, but an example we can cover in the time we have.

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,200
So, our first principle is to know your strengths.

00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,470
Know what you're good at.

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:03,589
So, if you come to this field with a liberal arts degree, it's not like you come from ground

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:04,589
zero.

00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:06,380
You have skills.

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,610
They may not be the same exact skills or you're not necessarily strong in the exact skills

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,000
as someone who came from a CS background has, but you have skills they might not have as

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
well.

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,180
If you understand the skills you have, you are strong, you can translate the problems

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,300
into a language that resonates with you.

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,160
Into a language that speaks to you.

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:35,661
So, for example, which one of these makes more sense to you?

00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:36,661
This?

00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:37,661
Does that make sense to anyone?

00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:39,779
I see a couple head nods.

00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,330
Or this?

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,860
Does that make sense to anyone?

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,790
So, this makes absolutely no sense to me.

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,291
That might as well be like Greek or something like.

00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,910
And no offense to people from Greece, it may as well be Greek.

00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,589
This doesn't make sense at first, but I know English.

00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,260
And I know English really well.

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,140
And so, I can actually parse this and translate it into something that's meaningful.

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,339
The negation of a dysfunction is the conjunction of the negations.

00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,970
Like the opposites.

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,040
Something that's together is the conjunction of something that's not the same.

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,240
It's the law, a logic principle.

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,019
Oftentimes white board interviews are presented† the challenge is presented from somebody who

00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:28,200
comes from a world where this makes a lot more sense than this.

00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,070
And so, the question with the unintended bias, the biases that we all carry around in ourselves

00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:39,750
on a plethora of things, whatever they are, they are biases for how we learn.

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,120
And we will present to someone who is interviewing a certain way a formulation of a question

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,730
thinking it's an easier way to understand it.

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,100
But ultimately, for the person interviewing, that might not be the way thing.

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,209
And it's okay if neither of these made sense.

00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,329
It's okay.

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:00,550
It's complicated.

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,980
But in general, people with a more technical proclivity, we like to limit the number of

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
words.

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,329
So, it's about being lazy.

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,790
Being a lazy programmer.

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,600
Being as efficient as possible with the minimum amount of typing you can possibly type.

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,189
Like, if I can have a shortcut in my IDE to put a whole function there, that's amazing.

00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:22,549
I want to do that.

00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:28,459
And I want to make sure if I can do this in 15 words or 15 key strokes, but do it in three?

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:30,190
I'll do it in three.

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,399
Readability is an issue as well.

00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:33,289
But limit the number of words.

00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:38,230
Liberal arts people like to think about how we can turn one word into a sentence, how

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:45,190
to make one sentence into a paragraph and a paragraph into an essay and an essay into

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,190
a dissertation.

00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,720
That's what you do.

00:17:49,720 --> 00:18:00,850
Rabbis talk in the sermons, priests, Imams, we like to talk about the idea over and over

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,850
again.

00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,070
I want to make sure you got what I'm talking about.

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,590
If I say it one time, two times, three times, that's not enough for you.

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,769
I need to say it four or five times.

00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:13,239
You over there, eight times.

00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,980
I need to see the idea so many times.

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,149
And at the end of it, you think you're going to get the job and you're like, what the heck

00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:21,179
just happened?

00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,239
Does he think I'm an idiot?

00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,280
But it's because we're very verbose.

00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,549
And I'm being verbose right now talking about it a lot.

00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:31,739
I'm demonstrating it.

00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:36,320
That's very important to be able to translate into a language that speaks for you.

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,039
Principle number two is every building starts with the first brick.

00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:46,840
Every complex idea, every complex idea is ultimately a collection of smaller ideas.

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,340
And the smaller ideas can be broken down into smaller ideas.

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,730
It's kind of like a multidimensional array.

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,190
You can break down ideas and unpack them and unpack them until you get to the first foundational

00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,190
idea.

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,609
And then† so, you're presented with the building.

00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,480
The problem is the building.

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,340
And your job, if this is helpful for you†is to deconstruct the building.

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,919
Thank you.

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,379
To deconstruct the building and build it back up again.

00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:17,340
So, if you deconstruct it and build it back up again, that can help you understand more.

00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,779
And lastly, principle number three, interviewing is iterative.

00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:21,779
It's an iterative process.

00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,029
At first, I was horrible at it.

00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,139
I'm still pretty bad at it.

00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:26,730
I don't know why I'm talking about it.

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,499
But interviewing is an iterative process, and if you understand your failures and opportunities

00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:34,779
to grow, you'll get better.

00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:39,739
This is a quote from a rabbi in Brooklyn in the 20th century.

00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:43,350
The righteous person falls seven times and rises again.

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,999
Because the knowledgeable are aware that the essence of rising is because of your seven

00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:49,999
falls.

00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:53,370
It's not in spite of your seven falls, it's because you fell.

00:19:53,370 --> 00:20:03,320
And you don't need a rabbi or a priest or an imam to tell you this, but look at the

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,450
handsome guy?

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,450
A nice face.

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:10,419
He wrote win at losing: How our biggest setbacks can lead to the biggest gains.

00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:17,020
At Barnes and Noble, it's an entire half a bookstore, how to win by losing.

00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,159
And ultimately, there's a lot of truth to that.

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,539
And so, let's take an example.

00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:23,539
Binary search.

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:24,539
So, good example.

00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:25,830
It's a relatively simple example.

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,320
We can apply these principles to it.

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,580
What is it?

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,529
Applying principle number one.

00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:33,359
Know your strengths.

00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,359
Move.

00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,359
There we go.

00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,769
So, binary is not a word that is in the lexicon of liberal arts folks.

00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,659
Break down the word binary, it's essentially one or the other.

00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,470
Zero or one, on or off.

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,950
One or the other search.

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,889
A method of searching one or the other place.

00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:53,059
It's similar to finding your name at a conference.

00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:58,720
If your name is like mine, Greenberg, not going to start at the beginning or end of

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,229
the table, but relatively near the beginning.

00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:08,659
You landed at D or F and narrow it down.

00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:10,460
That's a binary search.

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,510
Applying that one brick at a time.

00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,890
It's a list, and I have with the ordered value.

00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,269
Something I find that's closest to it, look through the section.

00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:23,809
Is it there?

00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:24,960
Yes.

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
It is there.

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
Then we party.

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
It's awesome!

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
It's there!

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
We're so happy!

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,970
Is it not there?

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,240
No.

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,019
Then at least we have limited the range of values and we can make two new sections.

00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:39,970
And then until we found it.

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,970
And we found it.

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,109
Then we are so happy.

00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:51,929
And in fact, psychologists tell us looking at cute puppies makes us happy.

00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:54,460
Feel the serotonin?

00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
It's awesome.

00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,269
So, we're very happy.

00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:59,710
We looked at a cute puppy.

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,149
And interviewing is iterative.

00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:03,380
So, you're at the white board.

00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,950
You don't know what to do.

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,919
The one thing not to do at the white board is to freeze.

00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:09,919
Write something down.

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,350
It may not be the perfect thing or the best thing bub at least it's something.

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,480
So, for me, and I know I'm a relatively new developer, but this is how fast JavaScript

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
moves.

00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,940
For me, it's easier to think in ES5 than ES6.

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:31,909
I jump to ES5 and interviews might want to see you declare a function with ES6 syntax.

00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:34,990
It's hip and cool to know the newest stuff.

00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,990
It's easy.

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,330
But I don't want to freeze at the board and do nothing.

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,490
I'll declare a function.

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,330
I know I need items, I need a value.

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,840
I declare a function.

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,039
Then I'm going to declare some variables.

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,919
And then write the rest of it.

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,159
And it's not perfect.

00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,330
It's totally not perfect.

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,480
That doesn't take the case of edge cases, doesn't factor in those issues.

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,539
And it might not be super-fast.

00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:01,210
It's not the best function in the world, but it gets the job done.

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,539
And then when you get the job done, you get to do the best part of the white board interview.

00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:06,960
You get to talk about your code.

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,129
Talking about the code in the interviews, you get an opportunity to think about it,

00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:15,590
out of the stress of writing it and you can go back and start making it better.

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,080
Because can't it†be made better?

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Yes, we can.

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,869
We can make it better by making it into ES6.

00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:27,809
And we can use the bitwise or zero operator which is, again, not a perfect thing either,

00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:31,360
but from a performance perspective, it is faster.

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,120
Take into at least one edge case.

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,410
That if the value is less than the first thing and more than the last, exit out.

00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:42,080
Don't need to switch the search.

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,539
We do a little bit to at least make it a little better.

00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:45,649
And can we make that better?

00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:47,229
Of course, we can make that better.

00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:49,179
Are we going to do it right now?

00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,179
No!

00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,179
Because I got one minute left.

00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,039
But we can totally make that better and keep on improving.

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,229
Because interviewing is iterative.

00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:08,529
Interviewing, coding, learning, growing, living, are all† if this was forward is iterative.

00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:09,529
All this stuff.

00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:10,619
Your life is iterative.

00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:11,789
The process is iterative.

00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:14,169
So, to recap, three principles.

00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:16,139
Know what your brain power is.

00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:20,129
Take the building apart one brick at a time and rinse, wash and repeat.

00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:24,830
And ultimately, one quote, I have to because I am a rabbi still.

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:30,090
Quote from Jewish tradition around 200CE.

00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:38,269
This means it's not your responsibility to finish the work, but neither are you free

00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:39,760
to desist from it.

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,950
The thing that is both amazing about programming is the never ending journey.

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,580
But if you see the journey as actually the destination and not continue to get freaked

00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,139
out that you're never going to end, then it becomes a process of not only a freaking out

00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:55,980
moment on interviews, but actually becomes an enjoyable experience.

00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,169
Thank you very much.

00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:57,470
