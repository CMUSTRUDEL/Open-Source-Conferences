Description: 
	Logging Off: Improving Low-Connectivity Experiences on the Web

Most people listening to this talk probably don’t have to worry too much about the quality of their internet connections. But when designing content for the web, we have to keep in mind people who are increasingly accessing the web on mobile devices or from places with less network infrastructure. This talk will outline how to design for low-connectivity users and why it’s important.

Hello and welcome to my talk on improving low connect connectivity experiences on the weapon.

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,090
I'm Valerie Woolard Srinivasan, I work at Panoply, the podcast network.

00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:33,680
Yes, podcasts, if you want podcast recommendations, definitely catch me in the hallway later.

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,580
But for now, I want to talk a little bit about the internet.

00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,480
Also, I have my Twitter handle up here.

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,680
Feel free to tweet me your thoughts, favourite quotes, podcasts, whatever.

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,250
I would love to hear from you.

00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,020
First, let's talk a little bit about the internet.

00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,140
I love the internet.

00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,160
We all probably do.

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,420
I'm willing to guess that most of us here have spent plenty of time there, given the

00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,830
topics of this conference, and are used to putting it to use for many aspects of our

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,650
personal and professional lives.

00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,750
This is one of my favourite things from the internet.

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,330
It's an owl with a tiny Santa hat on.

00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,321
But the internet is not just a great place for finding cute owls with Santa hats, it's

00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:21,049
an incredibly important tool.

00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:25,310
We are all fans of the internet, and work with it every day.

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,159
We've seen the power and impact that our work can have.

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,340
And wouldn't it be great if that were available to more people?

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,579
While I'm willing to bet that pretty much everyone in this room has a pretty reliable

00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:45,860
high-speed internet connection at home or work, or, let's be honest, probably both,

00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,609
that's far from the case for the rest of the world.

00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,820
54 per cent of households worldwide have internet access.

00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:59,389
84 per cent of access in developed countries, and only 15 per cent of households in least

00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:02,340
developed countries have access to the internet.

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,170
Some of these users may only be able to get online from a mobile phone network or from

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,410
their local library.

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,740
Perhaps it goes without saying the more forgiving your applications or websites are to people

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:28,170
who have slow or limited internet access, the more people L use them.

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:34,060
Also worth noting the regional and economic variations in internet accessibility, and

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,920
keeping in mind that internet speed could be a hurdle to people from lower income brackets

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,410
or from rural areas using your site.

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:49,700
It makes me think of this quote by William Gibson: the future is already here, it's just

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,470
not very evenly distributed.

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,611
As well as being the home for almost all of the work we as developers do, the internet

00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:03,150
has a lot of promise to level disparate tease caused by difference in class, education,

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,720
and access.

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,800
In many ways, it is the future.

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,670
But just like the future, the internet is not evenly distributed, either.

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,910
We saw in the last slide that there are huge differences in countries' internet access

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,000
due to wealth and infrastructure.

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,140
In addition to that, rural households are less likely to have internet access.

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,690
Poorer families are less likely to have internet access and more than likely to access the

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,510
internet on a smartphone rather than a computer.

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,980
People with more education are more likely to access the internet.

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,570
Men are more likely than women.

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:46,780
Young people are more likely than older people.

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,900
While there is not maybe of we can do for users who ever access the internet of at all,

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,531
there are lots of ways we can help users who may have limited internet access, and there

00:03:57,531 --> 00:04:01,350
are lots of ways that access can be limited.

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,780
Let's talk about the different types of ways people can be internet-limited.

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,980
People may fall into multiple of these categories, and they may not be permanent or applies to

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,500
all of the ways that the person accesses the internet.

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,720
First, there's the intermittent connection.

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,789
We've all probably experienced this as tried to use our mobile data network on the train

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:26,100
going between service areas.

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,160
This could also be a fixed internet access point that is unreliable due to service providers

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,370
or whenever.

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,750
In these cases, the phone or computer may report it's connected to a network but packets

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,139
are not actually being delivered.

00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,830
Next, there's the slow connection.

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,590
That's where reliable connection exists but it may be much slower than what we are used

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,490
to, making it difficult to load websites with lots of rich content or background scripts.

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,270
There's also the bandwidth-limited connection, which, again we're probably much more familiar

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:05,250
with on our phone but also exists on home internet plans.

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,560
Some users may be limited to a certain number of gigabytes of data use a month, making them

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,940
have a much higher awareness of how much data they're actually using.

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,770
Some people may also have sporadic or time-limited connections, which I've differentiated from

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,320
intermittent connections because they may be able to predict they could only access

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,280
the internet from their local library at a certain time, or a person who own connects

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,570
to the internet in a given time frame.

00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,630
And may want to cache or save content for later.

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,000
This is the part where I embarrass my mom.

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,139
I made her take this picture for me.

00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,010
It is of her internet satellite dish.

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,780
As you might guess, she and my dad lack access to high-speed internet.

00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,140
There are no fibre or DSL lines up here.

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,130
What there is is a clear view of the Scottish sky, so they get satellite internet with a

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:13,620
top speed of five megabits per second for probably than you pay for your cushier plans.

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:21,290
They also have bandwidth caps that caps their data usage to 10GB a month.

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:27,090
They didn't have any internet access at all when this picture was taken because their

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,070
satellite dish was covered in snow.

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,449
During the winter, one of my parents has to go out and clear it off if they want to keep

00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,000
using the internet.

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,250
Here's a full list of internet plans available from my parents' provider.

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:53,250
The top download speed is five megabits per second which is much lower than the 25 required

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,980
for the FCC's classification of high speed.

00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:12,440
You will also notice that all of the plans have fairly low bandwidth limits.

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,690
You can get all your downloading from midnight until 5 am.

00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,949
The limitations of this plan fall into three of the categories I discussed earlier: it

00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:27,320
is slower than we are all used to, it is bandwidth-limited and time-limited in that it is advantageous

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,730
to get your data transfers done in the unlimited window.

00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:37,140
With these constraints in mind, let's continue.

00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,490
Problems of limited connectivity aren't just limited to people in rural areas.

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,150
Here's a tweet from just a few days ago from someone visiting Germany who had limited data

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,150
speeds.

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,420
I think Nicole is at this conference.

00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:59,990
And this is from a story that the New York Times did in August of 2015 entitled, "The

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,169
costs of mobile ads on 50 news sites".

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:10,750
It was focusing on the costs of loading these sites to mobile users, both in terms of literal

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:17,100
cost on their phobe plans, and time spent waiting for things to load.

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,960
As you can see, a lot of the challenges that apply to mobile internet usage are also relevant

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,229
to other limited connectivity users.

00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:29,240
It found that most new sites took — news sites took longer to load ad content than

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,199
editorial content.

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,829
In some, three times longer.

00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:42,339
That means they're waiting three times longer time for your ad to load than the actual article

00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:45,019
that you wanted to read.

00:08:45,019 --> 00:09:07,300
Given that these [sound distorted]. ... to what

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:19,580
the app does, or whether it is added features, spun or polish.

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,830
If the things we are making users load aren't essential, are we giving them away to opt

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,960
out?

00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:34,070
Just to illustrate this point a little further with another recent example, USA Today's European

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,760
version of their site got rid of tracking scripts to comply with GDPR.

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:47,320
As a result, the size of an individual page went from 5 megabytes to just 500 kilobytes.

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,060
Some users don't mind advertising but they should not have to sacrifice performance in

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,440
order to load ads.

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,760
So where does that leaves us?

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,600
One of the most important things that you can do to support these types of users is

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,160
to build responsive websites.

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,960
More and more users are accessing the internet from mobile phones, and, for many, especially

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,370
lower income people, that is the only way they access the internet.

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,700
In addition to being tolerant to flaky networks as people move in and out of coverage areas,

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:30,290
any website or apps serving these users needs to be responsive and perform properly on a

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:36,959
small screen and possibly underpowered device.

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,040
Another important thing we can do is just communicate.

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,810
Signal and allow people to opt out of high-band yes, I did portions of your site, from both

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:51,279
a bandwidth and user experience perspective, there's no reason for you to have an autoplaying

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,930
video on your site.

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,170
Users should know any time they're about to download a file, you can use little download

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,630
symbols and indicate the file size and possible.

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,430
It should be clear to users when they're about to start playing a video or steam which again

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,240
should never autoplay.

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,130
Think about how you structure your content.

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,850
Remember that sites are loaded top to bottom, so, by putting important things at the beginning

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:26,290
of your HTML document, those things will load first allowing users with slow internet to

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,350
have something to read before the content loading.

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:37,420
Place assets or JavaScripts towards the end if they're not essential to be loaded before

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,899
the page renders.

00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:45,810
I had to include this because I was adapting this talk for a European audience, and I know

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,910
you like soccer.

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,560
I like animals.

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,470
This combines the two.

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,550
Talking about headers.

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,950
Optimise your caching by getting Tam with what cache headers you're setting, and trying

00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,420
to avoid users having to refetch content if it hasn't changed.

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,720
Things like fonts, style sheets, other static assets are examples of things that probably

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,370
don't change of over time, and you can improve your users' experience by not forcing a reload

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,540
every time.

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:24,709
Here are some guidelines based on UX research and attention.

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:29,709
It takes about one second for users to notice that they're waiting for something to load

00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:32,140
and start getting impatient.

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,060
It's ideal to have at least some content loaded after two seconds, even if you can't low the

00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,810
entire page in that time frame on a slow connection, it will give the users something to do after

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,000
they wait.

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,930
After ten seconds, a user will lose interest and is likely to be divert bid another task.

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,581
It should take one minute or less for a user to complete a simple task on your app, like

00:12:57,581 --> 00:13:00,720
signing up or making a purchase.

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,020
Longer than that and users will start to perceive sluggishness.

00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,700
You can try testing some of these guidelines and simulating a degraded network environment

00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,190
and see how long they take on your sites.

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:21,190
I found this recommendation from a UK NGO from about ten years ago that recommended

00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,540
an upper limit on page size of 25 kilobytes.

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,190
This was based on the connection speeds of universities and Africa, and the rationale

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:37,459
that such a page would take ten seconds to load over a 20 kill bits-per-second connection.

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:40,850
As a lot of you have know, this is really small.

00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,980
This may not be a realistic guideline for a lot of people.

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,980
It's older and the infrastructure may have improved, but at the same time, limiting page

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,779
size is very important.

00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:58,709
In light of that recommendation, let's look at some of the common libraries we are probably

00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,450
all using.

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:08,700
jQuery, 85 kilobytes, CSS is another 125.

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,760
D3 is 216 kilobytes.

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,980
Of course, these are necessary parts of sites for various reasons, but it is worth being

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:25,430
aware of the costs of these inclusions especially as we consider these are all before we get

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:30,810
to the size of any of the content on your website, and the costs of including these

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,529
libraries for bandwidth-limited users.

00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:45,350
If you're using jQuery for a couple of functions, maybe consider making that sacrifice.

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,850
If you would like to check the sizes of pages yourself, the network tab on chrome DevTools

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,000
can help with profiling this.

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,070
If you disable the cache and load a page, it will give you the total size of data transferred,

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:03,920
and, of course with caching, this is probably not the amount of data users actually have

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,730
to load on every page load, but it can still give you some idea.

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,900
I tried measuring the size of a couple of of pages.

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,709
They were all at least a couple of hundred kilobytes and plenty went well into the megabytes.

00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,740
Google page speed insights is another great resource.

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:31,180
You can take a URL, and it will give suggestions for how to make that page faster.

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,820
The ideas we've talked about so far are helpful for people with slow internet connections

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,279
or limited bandwidth but what about the separate issue of an unreliable internet connection,

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,570
or one that says it is connected but isn't?

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:50,660
There is a growing movement towards offline-first development, which is that a user does not

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:56,120
have connection and serves from a cache, and, if there is connection, updated information

00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,220
can be fetched and rendered.

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,360
Of course, it is not magic and only works if the user has successfully connected before

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,010
in order to populate the cache.

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:10,829
But at least it does not assume that they need a reliable connection every single time.

00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:17,480
Email clients are probably the sorts of applications that we're most familiar with that use this

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,700
paradigm.

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,410
Even if you're not connected, you can see the messages downloaded from the last time

00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,649
you were.

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,040
You can even write messages cued up to be sent next time you have a connection.

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:36,220
Par time is part of progressive web app development and can be applied to your sites and web apps.

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,890
The idea of offline first is helpful to mobile users and others who cannot predict when they

00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,329
are offline.

00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:51,430
Abdominal additional UI signals, like Google drive off line, can enable in those scenarios.

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,700
Within that research, you will find resources around offline first and how to start using

00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,700
it.

00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:06,670
I recommend the article designing articles first web app as a primer on the topic, as

00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,390
well as resources on how to contribute your ideas and learn more.

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,980
The big idea is that being offline is normal.

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,559
And something that should be treated as such, rather than just throwing an error or exception.

00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:25,800
A service worker is now supported on all major browsers.

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,340
It runs as soon as the page is requested, and before that request is sent out to the

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
network.

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,510
It can serve from a cache if the network is unavailable.

00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:41,050
Service worker introduces a new storage API, a place to store responses keyed by requests,

00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:46,090
similar to the browser cache, but it gives you a lot more control over what and how content

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,610
is cached than a simple browser header.

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:55,580
This can allow you to tell your browser to cache the pages locally so, if the user loses

00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,799
a connection, they can still access the site.

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,840
If you set up a service worker, you can have a lot of control how it works.

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,590
You can display a custom offline page, similar to a 404 page, or you can get more created

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:16,610
by having it cache the last couple of articles that a user has read on your site, or maybe

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,360
the most common content that people come to your site for.

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,830
You can also put — use this to put control back into the users' hands by giving them

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:34,260
sort of UI option to save something for online — offline use.

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,160
Here's Google Chrome's default online page.

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:44,600
You can play a little game with the T. rex which makes is somewhat less frustrating.

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,660
Another useful tool in Google Chrome is that you can simulate different network conditions

00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:55,490
in developer tools, so you can test how your website or web app looks and performance to

00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:04,669
users on different types of connections.

00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:08,600
I want to tell you why I think this is important.

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,831
In quote is from an unlimited connectivity users, primarily using a phone, and their

00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:18,150
access to new sites.

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:23,320
As you can imagine, as capabilities improved to make the most complex info graphics, and

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,910
most flashy and interactive features, keep in mind the users that you may be leaving

00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,500
behind as you make those choices.

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,550
It's really easy to always want to be on the cutting edge, always working in the coolest

00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,910
technology, but we have to remember that's all privileged in many places.

00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,650
That's a quote from Erin Williams from the Washington Post.

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,860
From a pure business perspective, the best way to reach more customers is to make your

00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,070
product available and more useful to people.

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:58,230
If your product, welcome site, or app, has a billion possible users the chances are good

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:10,740
that some are be in the groups that we talked about earlier —

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:16,700
it's also worth remembering that constant and reliable internet connectivity is a privilege,

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,260
and, by leaving out those who don't have it, we're leaving out a specific segment of the

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,730
population, largely rural, and/or low income.

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,900
In the last year, in the United States, we've been involved in a very heated exchange around

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,690
the internet's role in shaping our country, our politics, and our policies.

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,600
As we come to rely on the internet more and more in our daily lives, both in our logistics

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,570
and in our decision-making, we need to be aware of the consequences that making our

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:52,270
tools and information inaccessible to low connectivity users has.

00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,460
Access to legitimate news sources was a huge issue in the last US election, and one that

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,910
is likely to loom large as time goes on.

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,360
We looked specifically here at news sites and the toll that advertising sites can take

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,750
on low connectivity users.

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,940
If those users aren't able to load legitimate news sites, then we are in trouble.

00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,990
If services, applications, or tools are similarly unavailable to that group, we have a huge

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,280
problem.

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,700
Think about this and your responsibilities in this system as you develop websites and

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,559
design tools for the future.

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:36,790
I hope that this has given you some more context and tools for supporting and empathising with

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,669
low connectivity users in your development process.

00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:44,110
If nothing else, I hope I've convinced you never to add an auto playing video to your

00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,940
website.

00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,650
I would love to hear more from you.

00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:56,390
Again, my name is vein Srinivasan.

00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,820
If you're interested in podcasts, programming, and living in the Washington, DC area, I would

00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,630
love to talk about roles at Panopoly, or we can talk about our favourite podcast.

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,919
Thank you for having me.

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,690
I will be posting these slides on my Twitter feed and providing links to citations and

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,690
more resources.

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,690
[Applause].

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,690
>> Thank you so much, Valerie.

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,690
Having grown up in a developing country, I find this topic incredibly important.

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,690
Our next speaker is so special that we are going to take a few minute to set her up because

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,690
she brought props.

00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,690
Talk amongst yourselves, and we will get started in two minutes.

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,690
>> Hello.

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,690
We're doing a lit of an MC hand-off here.

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,690
I'm Rachel.

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,690
I'm looking forward to introducing receive knee for this upcoming talk.

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,690
She's a really cool person.

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,690
But I will introduce myself first, because Stephanie has still got a few moments left

00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,690
to go, and I think of myself as my favourite person!

00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,690
So, I'm Rachel Neighbours, I hail from the United States of America, recently moved to

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,690
Amsterdam.

00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,690
That's where Stephanie is also from.

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,690
She's a pretty cool person too.

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,690
What I love most about Amsterdam is that it has got a really funky creator-tech community,

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,690
of which Stephanie is a member.

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,690
But in the United States, I'm mostly known for working with web animations.

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,690
I wrote a book about it.

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,690
Basically filling air until we're ready to get going.

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,690
I know some people are changing their conference venue right now.

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,190
