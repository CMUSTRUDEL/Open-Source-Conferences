Description: 
	Ever thought about how the world would be without google, facebook, twitter and an open web? Let me tell you my story about webdev in China.

OMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/

Hi.

00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,849
My name is Hannes.

00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,670
I'm here to talk about web Development in China.

00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,990
I have been doing web development since 2004.

00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:25,720
If anybody remember this is.

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,809
I got bored of being in Hamburg and in Germany, so in 2011 I ended up in China as a web developer.

00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,210
And that was not completely my expression, but it was a little bit my expression.

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,899
That's a screaming legal person there.

00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,360
I felt like going back into the past a little bit.

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,850
Because in 2011 when I arrived in China, I had to deal with supporting IE6 again.

00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,199
This is a world web of IE6 in 2011.

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,719
And you see this stop there I zoom this in a little bit.

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,429
This is China with over like 30%.

00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:05,159
So, I was already supporting IE6, if not many more, and then I was right back supporting

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,159
IE6.

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,220
That was not great.

00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,770
So, in the last several years, all of this changed.

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,130
Now everybody is using a mobile phone pretty much all the time.

00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,540
And maybe you feel more comfortable booking a flight ticket on a desk desktop or a laptop,

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,770
that's what I do.

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:30,619
In China, they do everything except work, maybe, the majority does everything on the

00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:31,619
mobile phone.

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,920
So, they're highly mobile optimized.

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,600
How does this happen that people actually skipped computers?

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,960
It's the leapfrog effect.

00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,430
The majority of people had cell phones.

00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:52,009
And a generation skipped from a cell phone over the desktop to having a computer in their

00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,009
hand.

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,009
Having a smartphone.

00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,960
So, a lot of people, the majority of people, actually, never had a desktop at home.

00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,110
They just had the smartphone.

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,900
This is why most people always use the smartphone by now.

00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,689
Before going to the talk, an overview of what to talk about.

00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:08,840
The three topics.

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,220
The mandatory part.

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,560
If you do projects for people in China, what you need to take care of.

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,910
I talk about the important part, WeChat, the number one social media app in China.

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,670
And I talk about the development ecosystem, the community part in China.

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,000
I think this is the most interesting part.

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,040
I would like to know here in the audience, who has been to China?

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,370
Okay.

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,710
Not too many people, actually.

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,320
So, for the people who have not been to China, I'm going to pick you up there.

00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,140
So, you've heard that stuff is blocked in China, right?

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,530
Facebook, Tweeter, Google stuff is blocked.

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,600
But you don't know what that means.

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,240
Usually on a new country, you flip out your phone and ask Google how to get to the hotel.

00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,170
If you do that in China, this is how it looks.

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,150
You get the familiar blue spot, but nothing else.

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,440
Google won't talk to you.

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,730
And even though you thought you would be prepared.

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,590
You might figure out, okay, maybe not that prepared anymore.

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,010
Other people come to China a little bit more prepared, like Mark Zuckerberg.

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:21,100
He runs over Tiananmen Square in Beijing and was able to post it on Facebook so other people

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,510
come to China better prepared.

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,640
And now that you have an idea of how it feels to be a tourist in China, I would like to

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:34,420
talk about the first project in China, the project for people or users in China.

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:41,010
If your client tells you, hey, whack we do soc that people in China can use our web page?

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,720
First of all, you might add translations.

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,070
Maybe webfonts on that page.

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:53,620
I have a client, they have print products and we have a special one for Chinese characters.

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,680
Sending over here.

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,250
Having fonts for special Chinese characters that we use for printing products.

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,610
Maybe we can transform that file and you can use it on the Internet.

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,840
And I said, yes, that's a great idea.

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,920
Send it over.

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,720
They sent over a file and it was 50 megabyte.

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,260
Maybe not a good idea.

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,890
Chinese has a lot of characters, obviously.

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,290
So, they said, put it in anyway.

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,880
And I was like, maybe not.

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,510
So, the idea is, just use system fonts with Chinese on your web page.

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,480
If you want to use a web font, make sure that it's highly optimized.

00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,860
Another thing is people like to have maps on the page to show fancy things.

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,590
Usually they use Google Maps to implement that.

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,160
And this is the company, we have branches all over the world.

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,380
This is how it looks.

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,590
In China, it looks like this.

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,870
You don't see anything.

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,060
If you want to make sure that you have a map and the Chinese audience can see it, you might

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,830
want to use alternatives to Google Maps.

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,470
For example, Mapbox still works.

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,180
Anyone from Mapbox in here?

00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,880
Okay.

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,240
And maybe the better alternative is using the Chinese provider.

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,090
In this case, Baidu maps.

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,050
This is reliable within China.

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:14,380
You have to have the Chinese translation, but you can copy and paste code.

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,850
You sell stuff on your web page.

00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:22,000
And why are none of the Chinese users now that we translated stuff are buying stuff?

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,290
That's because you ask for western payment that are not popular in China pretty much

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,290
at all.

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,290
Nobody is using these.

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,010
Maybe some, but obviously not the majority.

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,290
What do they use?

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,820
In real life, you see lines in shops and restaurants, online, everywhere.

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,070
These three payment methods here.

00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:48,810
If you want people from China not to be hesitant to buy stuff on your page, implement at least

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,100
one of these on your page.

00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,470
It's not that bad if you already use a payment integration service like Stripe or Wirecard,

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,640
they offer one of these payment methods that you can easily integrate.

00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,100
And generally there is something hm.

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Okay.

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,230
In general, it's always like a good idea to hold stuff yourself.

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,550
If you use CDNs, content delivery networks or web providers, make sure they're not blocked

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,550
in China.

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,490
And make that sure on a regular basis.

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,920
You never know when things are changing.

00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,530
Maybe it's a better idea to host stuff in general on your own server.

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,840
Then how to improve performance?

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,940
You can host in China.

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,389
It's going to be faster to load for the Chinese users.

00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:42,033
Well, in China, hosting is a little bit different.

00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,940
Maybe you have seen the web page that has the small numbers down here.

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,050
Zoom this in a little bit.

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,780
It says ICP.

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
Maybe you can't read it.

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,600
It says ICP, & there's a number.

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,740
It's Internet content provider and there's basically somehow a number plate of your web

00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
page.

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,350
So, it indicates who is responsible for the content of your web page.

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:08,350
And, yes, if there's any issue, for example, that happened to other people that I know,

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,320
you have a country selector and you list all the countries in the world, including Hong

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,930
Kong and Taiwan, someone is going to call you and say, please change that.

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,700
Otherwise we're going to block your page.

00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,670
How to get this Internet content providing number?

00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,510
Well, you need a company in China.

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,750
You need an entity of a company in China or a corporation partner that helps you with

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,130
applying to this doing this process of applying for an ICP number.

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,350
And once you have done that, it takes a longer time.

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,330
Maybe up to six, eight weeks.

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,110
Then you can legally host in China.

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,419
And that was my first topic already.

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:49,050
It was to talk about don't use web fonts for Chinese, unless they're optimized, no Google

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,580
Maps, offer Chinese payment methods, host for yourself and be if you want to host in

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,910
China, get a license.

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,610
And the next topic is WeChat.

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,050
Maybe you have heard of WeChat.

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,020
Maybe people told you it's like the WhatsApp of China.

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,430
Maybe that was the case, but now it's changed.

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:19,139
And you use the different apps to do all kinds of things on our mobile devices.

00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,860
By now you could say that the majority of these things or all these things can be done

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,560
in China by only using WeChat.

00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,520
WeChat is created by a company called Tencent and integrated into Chinese society.

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,320
How it's integrated into daily life.

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,440
I would like to show in real life examples.

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,050
Here is a QR code in the restaurant.

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:49,589
I open the WeChat, scan the QR code and I can order food and pay, and it gets delivered

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:52,820
to my table.

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,320
I order coffee here with WeChat.

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,600
Here, these are like QR codes that you see everywhere in restaurants that you use for

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,820
scanning and payment.

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,430
This is me doing this.

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,330
Scanning one of these QR codes and then paying with WeChat.

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,120
You can also use that for street venders selling foods or things on the street.

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,080
They're going to show a QR code and you can pay with WeChat.

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,960
Basically, most of the Chinese people, or maybe just, yeah.

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,420
Most of the Chinese people, they don't take cash anymore.

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,350
They just need their phone and you go out and you can do everything with your phone.

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,240
You can also rent bikes with it.

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,830
Maybe you have seen these bikes also in Berlin.

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:40,300
And you know that you have they already have their own native apps to rent a bike here,

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
right?

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,790
But these are also, these functionalities, are also integrated into WeChat.

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:52,040
Once you have WeChat and you can rent all these bikes, you don't need the native app

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,470
anymore.

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,620
You can also do hospital appointments with WeChat.

00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,540
And the last thing that I figured out, apparently you can get a divorce with WeChat.

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,220
[ Laughter ] So, yeah.

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,210
You can do a lot of things with WeChat.

00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,930
And yeah.

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,670
To give you an idea of how this works.

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,120
Inside of WeChat, apart from the chat application, I want to introduce how it looks like.

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,370
For example, here you have the mobile top up thingy.

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,070
If you run out of data, you can top up your data plan there.

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,270
There's something called utilities.

00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,630
You get an overview.

00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,630
It's Chinese here.

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,440
But it's an overview of your utility bills, electricity, water, et cetera.

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,270
You can pay all of this with WeChat.

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,370
And there's another thing.

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,140
It's like third party operators.

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,440
These are being this is a default that comes with WeChat.

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,750
You can buy flight tickets, order, get movie tickets we buy food, et cetera, et cetera.

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,060
And usually all these services have their own native apps, but once you can use this,

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,560
why would you install the native app, right?

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,480
So, when we talk mobile first, I talk to some Chinese development friends and they said,

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,450
well in in WeChat?

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,399
In China you could talk about WeChat first.

00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,490
Because you need to make sure that your stuff it not working on the Safari browser.

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,120
It has to work inside of WeChat.

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,990
And you can also extend that functionality.

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,400
And before this was done by creating HTML 5 pages that will be opened in the internal

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,040
browser of WeChat and you can use an SDK and do payment and do the QR code scanning and

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,620
stuff.

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,779
But I think I don't know.

00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:38,870
One and a half years or one year ago they created something called Tencent created WeChat

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,520
mini programs.

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:50,150
And they are basic life a better extension a better way to extend the WeChat and write

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,610
your own stuff for WeChat.

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,940
And I'll give you an example.

00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,730
It's the Chinese Yelp.

00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,480
And this is the overview of WeChat.

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,339
And I'm asking for a recommendation for a Beijing duck restaurant.

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,839
And they reply with a link.

00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:07,980
And you get a preview.

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,850
And you click this, and the internal browser opens and shows the detailed information of

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,880
the restaurant.

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,950
In this case, it says on the bottom, it says mini program.

00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:27,100
If I click this, not the internal browser opens, but a loading layer opens for like

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,540
a second and then I get the information about the Beijing restaurant.

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,200
It's a good duck restaurant.

00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,330
And once you have done that and you installed this mini program into WeChat, you can also

00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,850
place that here on the right on your home screen.

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:51,170
And if you click it here, you get the Chinese Yelp in the mini chat layer.

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,430
It has a third party app.

00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,600
But as I said, once you can do the majority of things with the program, why would you

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,010
install to the native app or go to the mobile site?

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,470
You're using WeChat all the time anyway.

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,149
And you might say how this reminds me of a PWA.

00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,310
And, yes, you're right.

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,149
Because you can use it offline.

00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:20,240
You can add it to your home screen and it's really highly performance optimized and loads

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,180
really fast.

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,280
But in this case, it's a little bit special.

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:34,460
So, I call it WeChat apps, by exchanging the W. It is a little bit special here.

00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,860
Because these things are not hosted on your own servers.

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,680
These mini programs are hosted on the Tencent server, behind WeChat.

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,790
It's all over the world and delivered and opened very fast in WeChat.

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,410
There's an initial size of 1 megabyte.

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:59,690
And it's not 100% web technology.

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:04,930
It's web view and native components from WeChat.

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,870
Payment and QR code scanning and some other stuff.

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,510
Yeah.

00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,090
Tencent, how do you create such a new program?

00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:18,500
Tencent decided to create their own JavaScript.

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,750
It's called WeLang.

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:29,459
It's closed source.

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,459
It uses WXML.

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,940
WSS in JavaScript.

00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,200
It's pretty much HTML and CSS in JavaScript.

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,720
They called it differently.

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,990
And as I said, it compiles into a mix of native code and others.

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,470
They created their own enter.

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,120
This is the preview, this is how you write code, the debugging.

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,160
Looks like the Chrome DevTools.

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,610
Yes, it's a modified version of the Chrome Dev Tools I would say.

00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,510
This is the code for hello world.

00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,510
It's not big enough.

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:07,050
So, I'm going to show you two slides of code only, so you know how this WeLang looks like

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,790
so you're not afraid of using it.

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,430
This is the WXML.

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,010
HTML template.

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,010
Maybe people say it looks familiar.

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:20,630
It looks a bit like VUE JS.

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,020
And this is the CSS.

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,790
And this is the JavaScript part.

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,250
There's just a data property and I have the hello world and that's it.

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,010
And after you load the initial kind of JavaScript, you can do some other functionalities.

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,560
You get user information and stuff and stuff.

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,770
So, you see it's not like that different.

00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,880
Bootstrap, this is pretty much the bootstrap of WeChat.

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,430
They provide some UX elements that you can use to style it in a way that it looks like

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,480
WeChat.

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,529
Yes.

00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,350
That was the WeChat part.

00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,350
What am I talking about?

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,700
Talking about WeChat, the number one in China.

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,740
There are others, but this is the most important.

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:12,610
I introduced WeChat and the payment and the aspects of WeChat in programs.

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,589
And this brings me to the last part?

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,480
How much time do I have left?

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,550
Do I have ten minutes?

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,740
I have two minutes left?

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
Wow.

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
Okay.

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,269
This is the important part.

00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:25,269
Four minutes left.

00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:26,269
Okay.

00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,269
Cool.

00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:28,269
This is the interesting part.

00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:29,269
The ecosystem.

00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:30,269
The community of China.

00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:35,360
When I came to China in 2011 I was going to conferences and meetups and exchanging knowledge.

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,500
I had the feeling that was not the case in 2011.

00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,660
Not a lot of conferences and meetups.

00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:46,649
And people stuck to their own knowledge to keep their place safe in a way.

00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:47,829
By now this all changed.

00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:49,320
They have their own conference.

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,050
JavaScript, VUE, React, CSS, et cetera.

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,200
They have a lot of meetups in the bigger cities and they exchange knowledge way more than

00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,450
before.

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,500
They also created their own platforms.

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,239
Because when we use StackOverflow, we are comfortable using English more or less.

00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:10,860
But for the majority, there are a lot of Chinese developers that are fluent in English.

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,990
But the majority, I would say they don't feel comfortable using English all the time.

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,000
So, they can use this to search stuff and copy and paste code as we all do.

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,169
But once you ask a question here in English, you can imagine how it works out, so they

00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:30,450
created their own StackOverflow.

00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,369
It's green and it's in Chinese.

00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:34,539
And it's easier to use, right?

00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:35,850
If you're Chinese.

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,809
No, but this is not the biggest platform.

00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:43,029
I wanted to show this because of the name and the similarities.

00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:49,730
What they actually use is not Quro, but Baidu.

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,009
This is used to exchange knowledge.

00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:57,190
This is the creator of VUE JS, he's Chinese and has accounts on all the platforms.

00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,889
Not only western ones, but the Chinese ones.

00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:02,480
And, yes, they created open source.

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,409
You have big companies in China creating open source.

00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,859
All of this open source is being done in English.

00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:13,070
There's a documentation, communication, issue handling being done in English.

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,779
But the Chinese open source is completely done in Chinese.

00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:21,230
And they have to cater for a specific requirement.

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,200
So, they have to be highly mobile focused.

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,830
They really need to scale.

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,049
Because if you're a startup and become successful overnight in Germany, maybe add a half million

00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,299
users.

00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:37,210
Successful in China, you can add 50 million users overnight.

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,450
This is interesting for developers inside and outside of China.

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,320
So, they want to use this as well.

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,970
But now we noticed that not only Chinese have an issue being comfortable in English.

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,929
But there's an issue of us feeling comfortable in Chinese.

00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:58,510
And in these open source projects, these issues appear.

00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,419
Can we have English, please?

00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,690
Or, documentation and read me should be in English because, because, because.

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:10,700
And even better, and this is not a native English speaker, so this is why he doesn't

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,350
understand what that means.

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,659
He says, guys, please use English.

00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:18,359
And I say this a little bit because there's a funny answer to this.

00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:23,260
The answer says this is the best time to start learning Mandarin.

00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,260
Maybe it is.

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,989
Maybe that's the solution.

00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:27,399
Learn Mandarin.

00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,399
Fuck.

00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:30,230
This is hard.

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,860
Maybe not the best option to do that.

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,860
What can we do?

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,700
Well, everyone knew we had to figure that out.

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:47,100
Evan You says it lacks in documentation of learning resources for English speakers.

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,639
We intend to bridge this gap next year.

00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:52,700
That's important to bridge the gap.

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,210
Not only Chinese and English, but all the directions.

00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,210
How do we do this?

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,419
Well, we create and this is another Chinese open source project.

00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:04,690
We created a task, document translation.

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,389
Looking for volunteers who can help out.

00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:12,129
And I think this is so important that we do this because it doesn't only make it easier

00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:17,409
for people from not speaking Chinese to use your project, for people all over the world.

00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:18,639
Developers all over the world to use your project.

00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:24,769
But I think these kinds of tasks are also a great way with a low entrance barrier to

00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:26,669
participate in open source.

00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:30,679
Because maybe you don't feel too comfortable of writing great JavaScript.

00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,700
But you speak two languages, and this is your first step into open source.

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,289
You can start helping to translate stuff and maybe slowly getting into more of that.

00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,970
So, I think this is a great thing.

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,970
And VUE is doing this really great.

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,659
And VUE is very popular in China.

00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:51,229
That's maybe because the creator is actually Chinese.

00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:55,460
But also, I think, VUE in general is doing a great job in documentation and translations.

00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,539
I read an article because there's a huge community in China.

00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:09,039
But I read an article that there used to be a big problem of channeling back knowledge

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,080
from the Chinese community to the American or the international because of this language

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,250
barrier.

00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,499
You don't have this in VUE.

00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:22,989
So, I think if this continues, we are just going to use VUE soon because they do a really

00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:23,989
great job on this.

00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:25,889
No, it's just a joke.

00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:29,640
So, VUE is very popular and I think it's getting popular all over the world.

00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
But yeah.

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,149
They do a really good job on translation documentation.

00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:37,059
And that was the last part we were going to talk about.

00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:41,350
I talked about the shift from not sharing knowledge to actually sharing knowledge, having

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,529
conferences, having meetups.

00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,619
Creating their own platforms to exchange and share knowledge.

00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:50,960
I talked about the language barrier of both sides.

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,129
And I said talked about how to enable developers by providing and even more people by providing

00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:59,440
dedicated translation tasks.

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
And that's it.

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,919
Thank you very much.

00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,879
I'm done.

00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:10,840
[ Applause ] Oh.

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,570
If you if you [ Applause ]

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,570
Thanks.

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,989
If you have any feedback, let me know.

00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:22,309
