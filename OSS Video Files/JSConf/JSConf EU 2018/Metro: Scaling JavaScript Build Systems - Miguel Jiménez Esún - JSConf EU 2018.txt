Publication date: 2018-06-26
Playlist: JSConf EU 2018
Description: 
	React Native ships its own development server and bundler, which is both externally and internally used at Facebook. Making this process scalable and reliable is a hard process when you have a large codebase. We will be presenting and explaining its architecture, as well as the ideas behind it in order to make it fast; and we will roughly introduce the different output formats it is able to provide for maximum performance both on development and on iOS and Android production environments.
