Description: 
	Creating and running a non-profit community is not easy task and especially when a female is the organizer and doing it in country of social restrictions.

Hello, everyone.

00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,260
If you think that building a community from ground zero is very easy, it is not.

00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:23,910
It is the most difficult part and especially if you are not bagged with a brand name.

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,240
I have been there.

00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,270
I have seen that.

00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:34,180
Because most of the companies and people prefer to support the companies which are backed

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,180
by the brand names.

00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,100
A little bit about me.

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,370
My name is Neha Sharma.

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,740
I'm a full stack developer.

00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,350
I'm from India.

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,380
I am the organizer of JS Lovers meetup group.

00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:52,829
One disclaimer, I will be using the meetup and community word as interchangeable because

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,850
my own community is meetup.com, and sometimes I say meetup and sometimes a community.

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,790
And I'm an accidental speaker.

00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,130
I will show that too.

00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:09,580
This is my Twitter handle if you want to follow and see my tech Tweets, my community Tweets,

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,340
you can.

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,750
I started my journey with my community JS Lovers, JavaScript Lovers, three years back.

00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,360
And after they started living in this.

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,260
Best things happen when they are unplanned.

00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,260
Mostly.

00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,840
Because JS Lovers was not planned, but I started it and a most awesome thing happened to me.

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,460
Before that, this is my team five years back.

00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,740
As you can see, I'm the only female.

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,360
I was having two troubles at that time.

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,080
I moved to a senior level at that time.

00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,340
And I was not able to see a lot of females at the senior level.

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,260
I was not able to get a mentor for myself in my city.

00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,869
The second problem was, we all developers in my city, we were more focused towards our

00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,869
job.

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,560
We were not into collaboration.

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,280
We are not into sharing.

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,759
We are our focus is only our job, my little 9 5, apart from that, we were not interested

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,140
in anything.

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,590
And I started actually saying these things.

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,580
Learn something new every day for yourself.

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,209
Just not for your company, not for your job, just for yourself.

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,570
So, what I did?

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:31,050
So, I was just going around looking for mentors, looking for senior females in the tech field

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,970
and I was not able to get a single female in the tech industry in my city.

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,560
So, I was just talking to one of my colleagues.

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,400
I knew about meetup.com platform.

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,870
And I just bounced the idea.

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,630
Would you be interested in sharing our knowledge with the other people who are new in this

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,630
IT world?

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,380
And my colleague was like, yeah, I can do it.

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,050
Because he was a trained speaker.

00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,780
So, I said, okay.

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,290
On the same day, in the evening, sitting in a cafe, I built my meetup page.

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,370
I picked this domain and my event was up.

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,220
And my journey from a developer to a coordinator was started.

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,450
We had one chapter, zero sponsor and no experience running a community.

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,660
I had no idea how I was going to do it.

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,480
But after three years, here we are.

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,330
Now we have done [ Applause ]

00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,880
Sorry.

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,430
Okay.

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,970
Technical glitch.

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,170
Sorry.

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:47,060
So, after three years this is the stats.

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,060
We have done more than 55 meetups in just in my city.

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,580
We have more than three chapters in India.

00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,050
In Delhi itself we have 2700 members.

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:05,730
Out of that, 85% of the people are very active and we have 25 plus sponsors.

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:12,160
And not only this, we are the first community who will become the part of the Google Developer

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,700
Program from Delhi.

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,979
And we are the first, most active community from India to be a part of that group.

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:23,490
So, yes, it was a very big achievement for us.

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,059
But it was easy?

00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:26,660
Not at all.

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,999
I was having a full time job.

00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:33,740
I was having although I'm not married, but I have my parents who I have to, you know,

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,759
I live with them.

00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,749
The culture of India is very different.

00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:39,759
My first trouble started with my family.

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,229
When I told them that this is what I'm trying to do, my father's reaction was, I told you,

00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:47,759
become a teacher after schooling.

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,509
But you were like, no, you want to study computers and everything.

00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:53,259
Now you have a stable job.

00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,560
You are in a group.

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,249
Now you want to teach people free of cost by paying for the venue and everything by

00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:00,249
your pocket.

00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,249
You are stupid.

00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:04,219
[ Laughter ] And I was like, no, dad, it's not like that.

00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:08,710
It is not teaching as a job, it's like mentoring and helping others.

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,900
And someday I might fight with my family and that started.

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,550
And every weekend when I'm stepping out of my home for doing my meetup, I used to have

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,830
a big fight with my family.

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,010
Why you are doing this?

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,460
This is a waste of time.

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,110
They are not able to understand.

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,069
Not even my family, my friends also used to make a joke of me.

00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:31,999
So, many of my friends started following me on Facebook because my whole feed was full

00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,479
of the meetups, tech stuff and everything.

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:36,729
And I was like, okay, whatever.

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:42,879
So, today in the morning when I entered in the conference area I actually Tweeted, I'm

00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,889
sorry, I will be shamelessly filling your feeds with the JSConf Tweets.

00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,330
Deal with it.

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,240
My job problem was that.

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,080
But I didn't give up because I knew what I was going, and I was very focused.

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,749
How did we get to this level?

00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:08,470
You need to know where you are running the community, you need to understand the culture.

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,749
In Delhi, doing a meetup or event on the weekdays, it will never work.

00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,990
Only on the weekends people come out of their home to attend an event.

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,939
For that, you need to do a lot of hard work.

00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:26,069
You need no know your members and the tech industry.

00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,699
And I started the levels and Angular was just launched.

00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:36,879
People were running behind Angular, they had no idea they needed to learn JavaScript.

00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,369
There were a few developers that came to me and asked, should we just learn Angular in

00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,599
frameworks, or is it important to learn JavaScript?

00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:53,459
At that time, I decided to do the first meetup on JavaScript, no framework or nothing.

00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:58,729
That helped me a lot because there were a lot of people who just started their career

00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:01,999
by a framework and they had no idea about the basics.

00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:09,509
So, whenever you are starting something, please know your city, your culture, your client.

00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:13,159
I was ready for the events, I was ready for the meetup, but my city was not.

00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:18,332
There was not a single place available in my city where I can have 30 people with a

00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:21,060
projector.

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,539
I actually struggled two months to get a venue.

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:30,889
And I ended up having my first meetup at a cafe, which was at a party zone.

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,379
And I was like, what?

00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:36,039
And that was not even the closest venue.

00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,850
So, whenever we were doing coding, a lot of people were coming in and asking, can we get

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,889
the table?

00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:45,259
And we said this is a closed event.

00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:46,389
Area closed.

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,119
So, it was very troubling.

00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:54,429
But before that, the most troubled part that have venue is, my parents used to think that

00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:58,239
I'm lying because on the weekend I'm going to such a party happening place.

00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:03,020
So, they used to assume that I'm just going out to, you know, have fun with my friends.

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,189
As a result, I have to spend extra money to record whole sessions to take the pictures

00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,679
and go back and show my parents, see?

00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,679
I'm not partying.

00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:15,310
I'm actually doing something relevant.

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,539
So, this is how the logistics were very tricky there.

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:20,989
And with the speakers also.

00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:24,669
So, for one year we were not able to get an outside speaker.

00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:25,669
Reason?

00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:27,289
We were not a brand name.

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:28,689
Developers used to come.

00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:33,469
They used to love it, like it, but they were hesitant to come on the stage and share their

00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:34,469
knowledge.

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:36,459
So, nobody.

00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:40,860
I became an accidental speaker because of that because I started giving the sessions

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,860
there.

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,160
But now after three years, I have so many speakers sending their slides requesting,

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,389
but now I don't have the time to, you know, bring every speaker on the stage.

00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:54,649
So, this is how I never gave up.

00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,170
When I was not able to get a speaker, I took that responsibility.

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,130
I learned stuff, I stood on the stage and gave the session.

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,040
So, logistics are very important.

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,440
You need to work on the logistics.

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,050
The first venue, it was at a funny place, but the best part is, it was very accessible

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,089
by public transport.

00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,120
Because I'm a female and an organizer.

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,389
I know every female who is struggling to get to the venue.

00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:27,480
Delhi is not a friendly transport space.

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,650
As a female, when I was organizing, I was already taking care of these things by myself.

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,110
Community.

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,560
This is the most funny part.

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,790
Because when I decided to start the meetup, I was preparing myself that a lot of people

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,940
would be asking tech questions.

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,620
But nope.

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,430
What is a meetup and community?

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,360
And people are filling my messages with, what are you trying to do?

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,620
They were not able to understand is why a girl on every weekend is doing free meetups

00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,360
and sharing her knowledge and not charging anything.

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,009
Is she trying to sell something?

00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,620
Is she going to hire us?

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,839
Is there a company behind it?

00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,800
And I was like, no, my friend.

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,750
This is the essence of a community.

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,209
This is a community by developers for developers.

00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:19,660
I know the thing when I was looking for mentors and I was not able to get.

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:25,069
I'm helping you out so in the future you will go out and you will help others.

00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:28,570
But from most of the people, it was alien stuff.

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,910
And I was getting random questions around it.

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,899
And one of the questions which I used to get frequently was, what do you do on meetups?

00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:43,350
Because getting an online platform to an offline event is very tricky.

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,620
You need to gain the trust and especially developers are very hesitant.

00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:54,120
They feel very shy that how we will go to a random place, sit with random people.

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,230
Who am I going to talk to?

00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,220
I got tired of answering this question.

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,850
I went ahead and wrote a block.

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,120
JS Lovers meetup.

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:12,220
I mentioned each and everything, how I plan a meetup, do the topics, how I open the registration

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,220
form.

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,420
When you are coming on the day of the meetup, you will find someone welcoming you.

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,139
They will give out name tags and how this whole session will go.

00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,610
What we will solve and after the meetup is done, how to do the follow ups.

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,230
And I put a lot of photos and video of the meetups.

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,550
There was a huge positive response.

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,589
A lot of people started coming without asking questions.

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:47,500
Also, this article is getting shared by members of the my community when someone is joining.

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,550
Be ready, do not hesitate.

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:56,199
Go ahead and write stuff and put it on your website for your community because you never

00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:59,769
know what kind of questions people are coming with.

00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:00,819
Sponsors.

00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:04,810
The most interesting and important part of the community.

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,580
We were not lucky.

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,730
For one year we were running our meetups with our salary.

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:17,650
We paid for our food and venue and do the meetups free of cost.

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:29,490
I didn't have any experience, I have no experience how I can reach them.

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,730
Non branding meetups for the community.

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,629
So, let's try the time.

00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:42,709
But luckily for us, we got a sponsor.

00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:48,019
And, again, the same question, what are you doing on weekend?

00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:50,250
Are you trying to hire people?

00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,819
Do you have any sort of questions.

00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:57,060
And I was explaining a lot of that for working space.

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,259
And they got they were very happy and what they offered us is you can utilize our space

00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:03,259
free of cost.

00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:05,889
Then we did our meetup there is.

00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:10,029
So, this is how we got our first venue sponsor.

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:14,829
After that, we got Microsoft as our official sponsor.

00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:18,980
That was a big break for us because Microsoft was our first corporate sponsor.

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,579
They came up with the venue, food, as well as speakers.

00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,600
And this is how we have to get a sponsor.

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,980
First is food and venue, and second is knowledge partners.

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,029
They can send their speakers to send knowledge.

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:38,070
One thing I learned out of that, sponsors are a relationship.

00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:43,620
For me, it is not that if someone is sponsoring, I will say yes.

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,910
I first evaluate what value they can add.

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,980
What value I can add to them.

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,680
Only then do I say yes.

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,279
Because JS Lovers is a community dedicated to developers only.

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,189
So, if some sponsor is coming to sell something or pitch something, I just say no.

00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:03,009
Unless and until it is something valuable.

00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:10,660
Same with me, if I'm not able to add any value to their community, my community, I say no.

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,570
So, if you can going to pick any sponsor, please pick is very carefully.

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,860
It is very important.

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,110
Because your members are very smart.

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,709
They will understand that you have a paid sponsor standing on the stage.

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,860
So, you need to be very careful.

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,519
I have said no to many sponsors.

00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:34,270
And I don't regret because I know because of that there is trust of my members.

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,510
A few of the sponsors are here.

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,559
Out of that, Amazon.

00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,069
And we keep doing a lot of swags.

00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:48,890
And people get hooked to us.

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,339
But it is not that every time they will get swag.

00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:53,839
This is the most tricky part.

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,540
This is a surprise factor.

00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:02,019
If you are coming to our meetup this month, you might get, or you might not get.

00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,899
This is always a surprise factor.

00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:05,899
Collaborations.

00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,040
Collaboration was very, very important.

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,480
If you try to survive on your own, you will not go a long way.

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,459
You need to learn from and with others.

00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,459
It's very important.

00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:25,029
So, when I started JS Lovers after a few months, there were a lot of people who used to attend

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,300
our workshop from the first event.

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,880
And when they said, are you interested in learning something apart from JS?

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
And they said, yes.

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,339
So, we did an IoT workshop and got good response.

00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,670
I asked for the feedback.

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:46,939
Now they feel happy because they have a skill apart from the primary skill and they enjoyed

00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:47,939
that.

00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:55,519
And I analyzed and saw, yes, it is important, if I'm a developer, IoT, it is fun.

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,129
You never know what is your hobby.

00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:02,800
I started doing collaboration with other communities and other technologies.

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,889
And this helped my members as well as me too as an organizer because I learned what other

00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:10,379
organizers are doing, how they are doing.

00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:14,999
So, I was missing the biggest thing, which is code of conduct in my community.

00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:19,660
While I was doing the collaboration, one of the organizers actually shared with me that

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,129
you should have a code of conduct in your community.

00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:28,399
Because if someone is actually trouble you, that code of conduct can help you a lot.

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,860
And then I said, oh, yes.

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,059
I forgot.

00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:33,019
And this is how I learned it.

00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:34,870
By doing the collaboration.

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,450
By meeting new organizers.

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,790
So, please, if you are getting the opportunity of doing collaboration, do it.

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,790
I'm not scared.

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,660
A lot of people come to me and say, you are a JavaScript community.

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,779
Why are you doing meetup on this?

00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,220
Because my members are asking for it.

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,649
They wanted to learn and grow.

00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,180
Feedback.

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:59,459
Always, always ask for the feedback because this is what I believe, feedback is your next

00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:00,459
steps.

00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:06,199
If JS Lovers is able to come through three years just because of we worked on feedback.

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:12,920
If I'm not getting a feedback, I feel I'm doing literally a very wrong thing.

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,050
Developers are very shy.

00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,550
Especially in Delhi, it's very hard to get feedback.

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,140
It's very hard to make them talk.

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,839
So, the first thing is language.

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,530
Most of the developers, they assume that their English is not good and all that.

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:33,640
So, what as an organizer and speaker is we make them comfortable in speaking in their

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,659
native language.

00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:37,620
It's fine if you don't know English, but we know your native language.

00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,030
And we actually promote that.

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,070
Let's have a meetup in native language.

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,420
And then I ask for the feedback.

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,390
I never ask feedback in data questions.

00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,730
I also ask with options.

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,690
At least the audience will reply.

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,909
Do you like the location?

00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,020
Yes or no.

00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,620
Do you like having an event here?

00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,730
Yes or no.

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,890
Do you like the food?

00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:08,990
And I end the session with the open invite, if you like this event, please spread the

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,710
information about the event.

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,179
If you don't, please write me.

00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:16,470
I will look into it.

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,010
You need to ask for feedback.

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,970
Feedback will help you a lot and grow.

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:28,080
As a result, initially when people were not open to write their feedback on the meetup

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,220
page, event page.

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,860
Now they are openly going and sharing the feedback on social media.

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,250
This is how you have to do it.

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,640
There would be the moment when people are not doing it, but you need to push them.

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,240
And just keep doing it.

00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,919
It's not like this that everything is working for them.

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,919
Nope.

00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,870
A lot of things, a lot of places where I fail, my ideas fail, and a lot of things fail.

00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,480
A few of the cases, a lot of meetups.

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,850
The idea was to have a lot of meetups and have a lot of members joining us.

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,549
As a result, we were doing three to four meetups in a month.

00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:10,940
It was so hectic for the organizers and the members.

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,270
Because everyone was busy Monday to Friday in their job.

00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,309
And Sunday coming for the code lab is very tricky.

00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:21,630
So, this doesn't work.

00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,890
So, what we started doing is, one meetup once in a month.

00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,890
That's it.

00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,270
And that actually helped us a lot.

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:33,250
Now people started looking for that one meetup in a month to meet us.

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,780
Building the best team.

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,850
Running our community at such scale is very tricky.

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,250
It was just me and my co organizer and we used to have full time jobs also.

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,790
So, it's like a crazy job.

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,320
We were doing two jobs.

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,130
I was not able a build a team because we were looking for the best people.

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,860
And as a result, I was just ending up following with them.

00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,919
But after a few months I realized I should look for the self motivated people who understand

00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:03,420
what it takes to be a part of the community.

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,290
As a result, we are five people who help in social media, graphics and everything.

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,480
They take care of everything and I don't need to do any follow up or anything.

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,780
They just know because they are self motivated and they know what they want to do.

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:24,600
And this is the most asked question, what's the group?

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,890
People used to put all the code on the WhatsApp.

00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,659
And I had to drop that group.

00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:38,620
You need to be there every time doing moderation and everything.

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,539
So, it was like I'm running an offline community and also maintaining an online community.

00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:47,570
And every time I have to push the discussion from one place to another.

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,250
And I was like, this is not them.

00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,630
This is what you asked.

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,630
You need to run it.

00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,909
I can't be the organize the main person behind that.

00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:57,289
These two things didn't work for me.

00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:02,380
So, I stopped and kept everything on my platform, which is Meetup.

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,960
But the second problem.

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,320
In one of the meetups we have a few females and then there's only me.

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,490
Then there are a few females and then, again, it's only me.

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:22,399
So, I was hoping that a lot of females would come because a female is the front face.

00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:23,480
She is running the show.

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,230
She knows all the pain, she has taken care of everything.

00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,450
But, no.

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,760
This is not happening.

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,590
And then I started thinking is it is because the problem I'm facing with my family, friends

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,680
and society.

00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,700
For them, it is much harder because they are just coming to attend an event.

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,779
They can't explain why they are going for eight hour just to learn something.

00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,980
Because in Delhi, most of the parents, the parents, you have a full set of job, you are

00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,010
getting the salary.

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,010
That's it.

00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,080
Don't think beyond that.

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,760
Don't think about doing something else.

00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,530
I knew that trouble.

00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,649
And I was like, what can I do about this?

00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:06,060
I need to make sure that those females are knowing that something is happening, they

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,769
are learning and everything.

00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:13,310
Meanwhile, there was a girl who attended one of my workshops.

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,880
She reached me on social media.

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,919
She said she had some doubts.

00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:22,630
And then I started helping her in making blogs that I think writing blogs and making videos

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,630
and everything.

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:30,240
And as a result, after three months I get to know that she actually built her first

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,450
progressive web app.

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,300
She presented in college.

00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,010
Her professor liked it.

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,919
She gave a workshop at her college level.

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,070
They liked it.

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,570
And she also got an internship because of that.

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,820
And she actually messaged me that because you helped and guided me all through on social

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,870
media by doing videos, blogging and everything, I'm able to do it.

00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,769
Then I realized, it's fine if you're not coming to my meetup.

00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:59,559
But for me, it would be very wrong if you are reaching with me for help online and I'm

00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,750
not doing it.

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,019
I keep getting messages from people I have never met.

00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:07,620
I'm sure every speaker gets this.

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,820
You don't know me, you have never met me, but I saw your video and read your blog and

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,470
inspired me to do this or that.

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,080
That's what the community is.

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,670
That's what JS Lovers is doing.

00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,850
We are helping everyone.

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,040
Especially because I'm a girl, sorry.

00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:30,450
And everyone who is reaching me on social media, on my email that we need help and I'm

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,450
helping them out.

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,110
Guys, if you are a community organizer, if you are planning to run a community.

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,490
It's not just they came into the room and went; your relationship is done.

00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,240
It's about support and maintaining them after that.

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Please do it.

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,050
It will make a lot of the difference.

00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:52,889
As a result, meetup on which my group is, they actually invited me two months ago to

00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,429
their headquarters in New York to share my story.

00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:59,840
As well as they also covered my story that how I do a meetup.

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,720
A good thing also happened with me.

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,810
I hope this helps you a lot to if you're an organizer.

00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,810
You get some tips.

00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,550
If you are planning, you get an idea how you have to do it.

00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,960
The important part is, never, ever give up.

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,630
This is my mantra.

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,299
You never know who you are inspiring.

00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,440
Literally never know.

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,149
When I started, I didn't know I was helping so many people.

00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:29,620
But when I get messages, I feel so happy that a small idea of running a meetup, now it's

00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,620
reached this level.

00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,620
Thank you, guys.

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,120
