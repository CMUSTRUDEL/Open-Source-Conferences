In this talk Ivan will demo and explain the concepts behind his creations, the tools he uses; from basic 3D modeling and texturization tips, to how to assemble a complete application, wether a small game, a product configurator, a cinematic experience, an augmented reality ad, or a virtual reality tour, your imagination will be the limit.
