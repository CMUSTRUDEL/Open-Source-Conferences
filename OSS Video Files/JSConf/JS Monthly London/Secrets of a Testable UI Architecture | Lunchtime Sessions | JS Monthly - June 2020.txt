The Secrets of a Testable UI Architecture // Pete Heard
A Q&A will also be held afterwards

This talk is for UI engineers who feel like GIVING UP writing tests!

When we rely heavily on UI frameworks (React, Angular or Vue), integration tools like (Cypress or Protractor) and even browser intricacies (like HTML/DOM) to inform our test decisions; then eventually we grind to a halt because our tests become too complicated!

Instead of focusing on 'tools' in order to write tests we should instead focus on 'architecture'.

In this talk you will learn 3 secrets to creating a 'testable UI architecture'. The secrets will help you to scale your code and tests much easier. The concepts are taken from Logic Rooms breakthrough training course 'Ultra-fast Testing and TDD for JavaScript UI Engineers'.
