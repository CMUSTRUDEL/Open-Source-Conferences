	Green builds when you’re not Google // Duncan Walker

Continuous Delivery makes teams faster but at the cost constant vigilance - the build must always be green. So how do you keep it that way? Books like DevOps Handbook or Accelerate are packed with research on practices from some of the biggest tech companies. These are great particularly as your team scales. We’ll talk about some of these and focus on practical things you can do when you’re not quite at Google-scale. How you can do to improve developer experience? How can you use hard data about your delivery pipeline to learn where to focus your efforts, get feedback and fix broken windows?

Duncan is a Principal Software Engineer at the BBC. He works on the content production workflows for journalists - building systems to help them author content and test new article formats. Recently he's been experimenting with natural language processing of news articles.

Meetups are a great way to learn from our peers and to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. As developers ourselves, we at Pusher wanted to bring this great content to more people... So we built Sessions. On Sessions, you can watch talks that interest you and subscribe to be notified when new content gets added.
