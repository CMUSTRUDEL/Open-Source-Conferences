Title: Build a Form Around It - JS Monthly - August 2019
Publication date: 2019-09-19
Playlist: JS Monthly London
Description: 
	Presented by Sani Yusuf.

Reactive Forms are a mainstay in the Angular ecosystem yet a lot of developers limit their usage to just Login pages or traditional input collection. In this Worksop, we will showcase how you can take advantage of the full power of Reactive Forms to build some really powerful state-driven solutions. We will explore the hierarchy of Reactive Form Controls and showcase some smart ways to implement custom validation inside of your Angular application. The main aim of this talk is to enable users to be aware of what is at their disposal and how they can take advantage of the full power of Reactive Forms.

probably get it trust me

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,620

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,550

way why Albert I mean like the blue

people not that nonsense that they did

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,570
like a few years ago but blue people

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,920
2007 greatest movie of all time I love

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,489
this movie so much I started learning a

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,830
language yes exactly so I'm actually

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,479
pretty easy to find online I am at Sunny

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,010
Yousef every way if you find anyone that

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,570
looks half as ugly as me using that

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,430
username let me know so I could sue them

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:22,110
right okay let's begin let's talk about

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,450
forms so forms right they are pretty

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,990
much the most underrated thing like in

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,990
just in the world right they have the

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,210
ability to make or break your business

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,939
you never thought this was a form digit

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,140
right never occurred to you alright but

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,700
when you think about it now it's a form

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,650
this is the world's most expensive for

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,070
this is a seven hundred billion dollar

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,560
for what are this one for there is no

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,280
business there is no snooping P what

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,310
people are doing

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,479
there's no you fill in around with

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,790
elections and all of that

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,470
without this one thing literally they

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,340
have the ability to make or break your

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,380
business they the backbone of everything

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,040
our day to day not just businesses but

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,210
our day to day lives right and some of

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,580
you might not believe me but you use

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,619
them every day you use them every day

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,239
never thought about this one write this

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,840
one that allows a certain person to

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,030
really scare us every day

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,650
and that one where everybody tells you

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,430
how many kids they have and what they're

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,570
doing and all of that and who can who

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,690
hear things that they haven't used the

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,030
form today what if you think you haven't

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,370
used five forms today

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,470
what about ten if you feel like you

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,860
haven't used up to ten forms today I can

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:38,430
bet you that you have even twenty your

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,950
address bar what's that

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,840
it's a form you came to this building on

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,330
your way up you entered the elevator

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,610
what did you press you interacted with a

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,680
form do you know why I radio button is

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,350
actually called a radio button because

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,380
the old cars had like an actual radio

00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,420
button that you press like one two three

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,250
so we use forms every single day and we

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,830
don't even realize that their forms when

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,050
you're about to make a phone call what

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,920
are you using you're using a form zero

00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:12,490
eight zero zero seven zero that's a form

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,990
so here's how we're gonna start I'm

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:18,330
gonna show you some really terrible

00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,330
forms a really bad forms

00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:24,430
does anybody know this type of form this

00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,570
one you know you're about to do

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,739
something maybe you want to pay your

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,480
money you want to do something you just

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,680
landed on the website and it's already

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,810
complaining that you've killed somebody

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,940
like you haven't done anything you

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,769
haven't touched any form field but it's

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,030
already complaining you haven't given me

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:39,880
your password you haven't give me your

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,530
using like give me a bloody chance let

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,810
me actually do something first

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,610
all right so this is a terrible from

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,070
where we haven't interacted with the

00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:51,070
form yet what the form is already

00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:53,650
complaining and guess what these these

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,019
colors these these experiences they have

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,540
they're in tune with actual our actual

00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,709
emotions like have you ever tried to pay

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,150
for something online and you go on the

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:02,860
web page and the form is like not

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,360
mobile-optimized and I write there you

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,950
give up on like paying the stuff and

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,690
you're like I'm actually just gonna go

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,549
home and do it on my laptop or like I'm

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,500
gonna just use someone else right

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,860
because one of forms stresses you you

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,620
actually feel stress it's it's it's a

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,000
user experience thing right and part of

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,549
the reasons why people actually be

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,080
terrible forms that is life forms out

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:27,560
ridiculously difficult to build they are

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,450
very difficult right what about this one

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,400
who can tell me what they think is wrong

00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:36,830
here exactly the submit button is

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,690
enabled even though the form is invalid

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,210
so you're just going to go to the server

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,730
and come back and nothing's going to

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,680
happen so it's a waste trip literally

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:48,290
you just wasted a round trip to the

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,990
server and back right sometimes you know

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,090
it's very important you are clear like

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,220
you make it clear what information is

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,600
mandatory and which one is not the

00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,150
pattern I actually like to follow is

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,400
only make the optional fields optional

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,810
and just as you know put a little star

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,850
and just expect that every other thing

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,500
is mandatory label the ones that

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,700
optional and that way the user can be

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,470
like okay if this is option and that

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,150
means these ones have to mandatory

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,550
sometimes you know when you're doing

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,070
call-to-action or acquisitions you you

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,960
have to keep the call-to-action button

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,300
enable think about Facebook you know or

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,530
email list they're not gonna disable it

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,300
it's always active there right what

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:33,200
about this one you can tell me what is

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:35,810
wrong here said again yeah that's fine

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,880
but I'm interacting with my last name

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,310
but the first name the password and

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,680
email are complaining right you want my

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,510
information boy you're angry that I'm

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,250
treated I'm deciding how I want to give

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,260
you my information so you shouldn't

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,640
really bother like you shouldn't be

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,950
bothered you should just say okay I'm

00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,140
giving my law my last name fine you can

00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:57,260
give me the for whatever reason maybe

00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,780
you want to give me information the way

00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,479
you want to that's fine but you should

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,440
basically focus on only what I'm doing

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,240
if I'm for type in in the email field

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,650
focus on the email field you know yeah

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,770
you probably been on these websites

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,120
where literally you've you're putting

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,100
the user name or you started putting

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,570
your password and it's telling you that

00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,040
you haven't given it eight characters

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,380
long and literally your type and you're

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,540
like what is going on here like I'm

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,440
giving you the information or you're

00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,300
putting your credit card information

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,520
depends like oh this is not a valid

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,630
critical well of course it's not I

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,780
haven't finished

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:36,890
it's 16 characters so focus on what the

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,270
users doing right what's the code so

00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,490
it's very important that you're able to

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,440
detect when a user has touched a

00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,120
and has like interact all that fields

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,289
but you can give them a very custom

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,360
experience right and sometimes order

00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:54,770
when you have like order or is very

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,370
important maybe if you are like Amazon

00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,690
and you need the person to give you the

00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,849
postcode first so that you don't waste

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,830
that time just say look we don't deliver

00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:04,970
to you or you know we need you to pay

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,699
extra money that kind of thing

00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,380
then maybe order does matter then you

00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,539
can like you know disable this typo but

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,599
for the most forms that we use order

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:16,849
should really matter all right and this

00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:20,210
guy this is the reason why nobody likes

00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:21,530
doing taxes all right it's like it's one

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,780
of those forms as soon as you see you

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,720
just give up right and this is finally

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:29,270
white exam freaks people out like what

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,789
there's no one ever that loves to go to

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,710
sit in an examination because once you

00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,720
get in there you see ten questions which

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,900
you haven't studied known for right and

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,370
it freaks you out and this kind of why's

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,370
sometimes like there are a lot of

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,840
studies around how people like

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:48,110
universities are creating like form

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,580
fields for exams like you know like they

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,680
basically put questions and different

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,870
papers on purpose just to ease you off

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,729
like okay start with this one and all of

00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,800
that instead of like seventy questions

00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:59,870
you have to answer all of them right so

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,370
this is a long form what you should have

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,199
is you should progressively allow the

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,430
user maybe they should get their

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,080
personal details out of the way first

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,180
put a little you know you have five

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,020
sections section one is done you know

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,180
okay

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,740
section two section three put give us

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,759
your cat detail your dog details and

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:19,039
things like that alright and this one is

00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,199
probably the west lot of them or and I

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,110
think everyone here has experienced this

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,050
one you know I want to sign up to this

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,490
new great social media application and

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,889
I'm gone you know I'm creating my very

00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:34,729
creative username man's not hot and what

00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:37,279
happens bang-bang-bang man's no hot is

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,579
already taking but guess what I gotta

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,649
start all over again alright so not only

00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:44,930
have you wasted my time taking me to the

00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:46,910
server and back but where's all my

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,430
information that's too soft

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:53,000
so this everyone has experienced this

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,230
before at some point right so this is

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,090
what I say to those experienced

00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:01,250
just know like why in 2019 we should

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,810
have way much better forms which it have

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:07,520
the ability to create much more

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:10,760
empathetic applications right the one

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,400
place actually that I won formed I

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,080
particularly like and because I travel

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,490
around the world a lot but one form I

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:22,790
really really like is it's actually TfL

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,720
the TfL muscle code you know the little

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,030
Oyster card

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,460
totally yeah I work from home so you

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,990
could you know why I don't even know

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,180
what the machine is code anymore well

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,480
yeah the thing the thing where you go

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,790
put the money yeah then once the TfL

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,510
machine that one alright you know what

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,250
I'm talking about

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,810
it's actually pretty good it's not great

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,170
but it's pretty good because it's

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,750
actually it allows you to fill and

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,260
recharge your Oyster card even though

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,510
like it's very language agnostic as well

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,800
so if I'm like a French speaker and I

00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,420
speak multiple languages when I look at

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,040
the TfL the flags are correct the the

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,990
languages they're all correct so you can

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,950
if you're like a let's say you an Arabic

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,240
speaker for example you can just

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,670
recognize Arabic right there and just

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,110
click it and you can progressively fill

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,700
the form but also there's a lot of

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,010
things we don't really think about with

00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,940
forms so for example in a form field you

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:18,140
might do something like put like drinks

00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,050
or for like parties or you know

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,430
something like that but maybe some parts

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,500
of the Middle East you don't want to use

00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,240
those icons you know maybe use a balloon

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,610
instead things like that so you also

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,670
have to be like culturally like

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:35,180
sensitive as you create forms so like I

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:37,760
said the reason why a lot of these forms

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,280
exist is because firstly forms are very

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,930
difficult to create and we just don't

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,060
really know how to do them really well

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,790
and I guess this is what angular

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:51,310
reactive forms tries to solve any

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:55,010
angular developers in the house ok all

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:58,490
five of us any react developers in the

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:02,600
house any react developers that will

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:04,040
happen to open Twitter this weekend ok I

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,950
think everybody knows what happened

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,730
right but anyways let's leave that aside

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,110
so

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,630
what I'm going to show you is I seen its

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,220
using angular reactive forms but you

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,810
don't necessarily need to be an angular

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,779
developer to kind of get the gist of it

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,670
right so reactive forms is a module that

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,350
angular gives you an angular as one of

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,060
those you know technologies that pretty

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,550
much is like it gives you everything

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,760
it's like you got to do it my way or no

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,500
way

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,480
it's it's like you're using angular

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,490
author right there's no quite like react

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,560
where it's sort of like you know tap ass

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:41,240
you know so like only what you need and

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:43,130
I okay it is kind of tapas right like so

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,720
like you know only what you need if you

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,100
do something else you go get it what

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,709
angular is just like here's everything

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,449
and then but what and it's two different

00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:52,639
on most code approaches and I actually

00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:54,230
love it cuz react is more speed what

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,579
angular is more I'll give you the heavy

00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,320
thing then when I'm building your

00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:59,839
application I'll use pre shaking and

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,740
take out what you don't actually need so

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,690
just two different things

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,149
so the one thing that reactive forms

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,190
gives you is the ability to observe or

00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:09,709
you can observe what a user's do it you

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,180
can see how they touch this field have

00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:13,399
they not touched this soon where are

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,630
they you know do they have to feel

00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,850
certain information what if I want my

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,829
phone field to have this characters long

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,779
right have they done that has the user

00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:22,940
done that so you can observe how the

00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:25,160
user is using your your actual HTML form

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,260
and then that in turn allows you to be

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,949
empathetic right allows you to have

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,600
empathy

00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:32,089
you know because a form is supposed to

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,250
guide a user to fill in information and

00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:36,500
in this day and age where data is the

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,620
new oil is very very very critical for

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,800
everything we do right if you basically

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,959
are waste of people they will not give

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,880
you their data today so you need to like

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,490
you have to be nice like hey you know

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,529
give us your data all right you know

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,680
give us your first name hey by the way

00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:56,180
if you actually enable notification will

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,579
give you a much better experience that

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,170
kind of thing I I think now when you go

00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:03,069
to every webpage the first thing you see

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,000
is location on like you go to like

00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:06,620
something like I don't know like the

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,949
government's website and like location

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:13,310
on I'm like yeah sure I'll enable it

00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:15,290
it's that kind of thing so composability

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,939
is another one yeah ability to really

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,649
cuz so some of us here work with really

00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:20,449
complex phones by the way who works with

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,290
like your business or where you work

00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:23,300
like

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:26,210
forms are critical anyone in the house

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,860
right exactly so a lot of a lot of us

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,120
here maybe enterprise you know it's all

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,130
about information exchange

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,570
so composability is you want to create

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,400
something nice specific to your company

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,420
your company has a specific experience

00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,700
that you don't want to be rewriting

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,950
again and an extend ability as well

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,990
taking what angular already has and

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:44,570
extending it maybe you want to create a

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,910
different type of form like element

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,200
right yeah it was recently well I'm

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,210
sorry was at the class I think two years

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,310
ago in New York I found out that the

00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,720
radio button actually has three states

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,250
not to say it's not just checked on and

00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,500
checked there's a third state called

00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,720
inter determinate basically not checked

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,270
or checked which is crazy but apparently

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,750
there was one guy by his company needed

00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:09,650
it and the w3c spec decided you got a

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:11,270
point and exactly so so the building

00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,610
blocks of reactive forms reactive forms

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,860
has bunch of building blocks everything

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,420
is starts from from what we call the

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,700
abstract control that is like the

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,400
abstract itself it's an that's the

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,630
abstract level member and then from

00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,160
there you have what you call a form

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,590
control which I'll talk about shortly a

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,690
foam group and a form array which gives

00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,370
you a little bit more like specific

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,620
types of experiences that you can use to

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,140
build forms so let's have a look at the

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,060
form controls first how to use reactive

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,290
forms firstly you you know if you know

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,390
and your angular application you'd

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,790
import the reactive forms module to

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,960
declare that you need it and for the

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,910
people that work react this might all

00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,750
look like you know gibberish just just

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,120
just let it go

00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:54,740
it's just it's just like doing import

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:57,200
you know or require all right so form

00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:00,200
control is like the base level element

00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,630
you'd create in your class the instance

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,570
of a form control and then you attach

00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:08,150
that form control by attaching the form

00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,920
control property you bind to it the form

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,290
control so in angular whenever you see

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,090
the square bracket around any property

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,340
name your binding to the property you're

00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,720
busy enabling angular and then you pass

00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,430
the instead of that form control from

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,470
the view model class or the component

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,440
class so you have a one-to-one mapping

00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:27,890
and each of this the form control itself

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,230
you can like one so the first parameter

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,670
there is the initial value you know it

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,780
could be empty or it could be some value

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,610
you're getting from a database to

00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,000
pre-populate but also you can have

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,530
things

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,880
by validators for example which I will

00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:43,250
show in my code demo and so you use the

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,500
form control property but for a lot of

00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,180
times you're not really working one

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,710
element you're working with a form

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,230
element right and you have a bunch of

00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,880
elements and maybe if I click this field

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,790
this one should be disabled you know all

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,790
those crazy things if you've tried to do

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,710
air BnB for example you can their forms

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,230
are pretty messy by the way there is a

00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,330
trick in air BnB try zooming in and

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,840
zooming out the prices change thank me

00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:12,290
later yes you can tell I'm cheap I'm

00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,120
Nigerian hey I love my money so yeah try

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,680
zooming in it actually works

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,150
so zooming because a lot of people that

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,040
have property they have their eye like

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,680
cuz I use Airbnb they put it on like

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,590
Auto pricing so if you zoom in the less

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,840
Prophecy's you see the prices change so

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,060
do that next time you book it well yeah

00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,240
when you're working with a form element

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:34,280
you you do this you can use the form

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,870
elements aggregate and the form group to

00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,270
aggregate a bunch of elements in the

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,490
form and it gives you an object based

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,990
API so you can access the elements as

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:48,110
objects so let's have a look at that

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:52,820
quickly okay where is the animation okay

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:54,589
I command you to animate good okay so on

00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,240
the class over there you would create

00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:58,940
the instance of the form group this is

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,589
the the imperative way you know you

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,900
created and you add like for example

00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:04,640
first name is a member now it's like a

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,370
member I'm associating I'm giving an

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,530
instance of a form control right and you

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,020
can see so basically I've attached this

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,240
form group here instance with that and

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,829
then I can just associate first name to

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,319
this field like this with form control

00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,939
name and last name and things like that

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,829
so I'm associate in different fields

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,170
with in the context of that particular

00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,510
form control but the greatest thing

00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,850
about the form group is it doesn't just

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,950
take the members don't have to be form

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,740
controls they can be any abstract

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:36,530
control so first name could be another

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,900
form group so that allows you to really

00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:41,930
cascade and create really super complex

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,610
forms right and then you have the form

00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,560
array which is basically just like the

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,250
phone group but gives you an array like

00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:51,340
syntax so index base instead of of

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,190
on bass nobody really uses it but yeah

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,050
someone somewhere probably needs a

00:17:53,190 --> 00:18:01,000
actually I use it that makes me weird

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:02,410
and you have like a declarative way

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,230
which is an easier way to actually

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,210
create the form group where you can just

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,770
sort of like create like a an object and

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,180
just pass the form builder and the form

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,170
builder we just generate everything for

00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:16,960
you right so I want to see some code

00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:20,590
right yeah I told you had my ass kicked

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,360
don't worry look at my defense exactly

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:26,050
try to be a black man key they didn't

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,400
quite work out but yeah so we're gonna

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,020
have a quick demo I'll show you how the

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,660
value changes work the built-in

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,030
validation the composition and also

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,280
custom validation then a magic feature

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,870
which is custom async validator that

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,360
basically allows you to validate the

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:43,810
form while making asynchronous requests

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:49,480
to the server or local alright okay so

00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:54,310
let's have a quick look I think I'm

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:56,490
supposed to do this okay oh look I'm on

00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,960
Twitter sorry

00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:02,920
alright the first thing we're gonna do

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:06,940
here is called the okay so you can't see

00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:09,060
this let me hide it as a zoom thing let

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,160
me open this in a new window

00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,020
right so here I'm just going to show you

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,910
the first thing I have what I built is

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,010
basically I rebuild Twitter right and

00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,750
you know remember I talked about the the

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,520
reactive forms has different states now

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:25,600
you can watch so you can see here it's

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,160
untouched invalid and pristine so for it

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,260
to be touched you'd have to interact

00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,940
with the field and leave it and you can

00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,280
see automatically because angular works

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,990
at RIT X I don't actually need to listen

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,420
for the state it automatically updates

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,430
the state so invalid is basically based

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,320
on the validators and pristine is if you

00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,910
haven't changed the initial value so

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,950
let's have a look at the code before we

00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:48,100
interact with this so you can see here

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:52,150
what I've done on line 18 I'm basically

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,430
saying create me a form control with an

00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,690
initial value that's empty but also one

00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,150
of the validators I wanted to be

00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,540
required so for this particular form

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,990
control to be valid what needs to happen

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,960
based on the rope

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:07,150
fired validator exactly it has to have

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,640
some value and that's it but you can

00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,190
also have multiple validators right and

00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,990
here you can see I'm using like some

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,600
observable stuff to just calculate the

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,429
length because it gives you a value

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,809
changes property that's a basically our

00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:21,910
X Y X observable think of them like

00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,020
events that keep emitting as the value

00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,270
keeps changing so you can get the

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,250
current value get the length you know

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,990
subtract it from 280 characters I think

00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,760
that's what Twitter allows and then you

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,830
can always just automatically get how

00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,010
many characters left so if we look at

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:38,140
the this now if I you can see now it's

00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,730
valid and you can see as I type the

00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,920
numbers are reducing and you can also

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:45,190
see the the tweet button suddenly

00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:48,670
becomes active and now it's dirty dirty

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,960
basically is once the initial value has

00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,000
changed oh no even if I come back to

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,620
empty it will always be a dirty form you

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,559
now you know that the user has

00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:00,670
interacted with this form and how did I

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,920
make the tweet button disabled on the

00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,590
HTML side of things all I've just done

00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,380
is I've attached a disabled in the

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:11,380
standard HTML disabled property bound it

00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,360
to a property called invalid from the

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,970
form control so this all will be true or

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,520
false based on all the validators right

00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,990
so this is just a simple simple example

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,440
let's see something a little bit more

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:30,040
flashy so let's close this guy here and

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:34,059
let's go to this guy here open a new

00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:38,700
window so what do we have here

00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:41,710
so we have some fields here you know

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,020
what's it called you just need to give

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,210
us your emo and trust us and you can see

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,580
each field that you provide here you can

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:51,250
see so if I say son I've just given

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,070
everybody my email yeah honey it's Annie

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:56,170
calm pretend you didn't see it you can

00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,240
see how it's changing now it's valid

00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:01,470
it's dirty and it's untouched why do you

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,820
think it's still on touch anybody

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:06,700
exactly you haven't actually left focus

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,480
no like it's like you actually haven't

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,710
touched I touched it it's crazy

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,950
probably some there's a class on

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,970
philosophy so so password for password

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,800
to be valid unless he actually

00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,720
what we need so here you can see I'm

00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,890
using a form group right and for

00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,340
password to be valid what needs to

00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:32,650
happen anybody based on the validator on

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:34,900
line 22 said again yeah has to have some

00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,880
value right just required and the same

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,680
for the confirm password field right so

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,020
let's go and give it a confirm confirm

00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,480
password field so I'm just gonna type

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:47,650
one two three here but if I type three

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,990
two one here they're both valid right so

00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,690
technically this form is valid but do we

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,490
want that behavior no so that this is

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,220
what we create a custom validate on the

00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,740
form group level now what overriding the

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,320
phone we say I know every guy like

00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,690
everything everything in there is valid

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,690
right but here's what I want you to do I

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,520
need you to override that and we do that

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,250
by basically creating a validator on the

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,100
group level and say hey give me the

00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,120
instance of that form group check the

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,370
password field and a confirm password

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,650
field and if they don't match throw out

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,040
this error if they match everything's

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,530
good

00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,620
right just don't bother so but is like

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:30,310
the false case is good but the true case

00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:32,500
is false it's weird but yeah so now if

00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:35,650
they don't match return no don't bother

00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,960
but if they or what's it called if they

00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,670
don't match then return password match

00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,680
true that's the name of the error so you

00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,990
can always check for that password match

00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,600
true case and if you look at the HTML

00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:50,350
here we can actually check here to say

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,480
if has error password match on line 19

00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,620
so we can always see does it have that

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,600
error we don't need to go and

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,430
individually check we can just ask the

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,010
form group do you have an error on

00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:02,590
password match no okay you're all good

00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:05,080
and that's it so that's sort like just

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,580
if we go back there and like type one

00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,340
two three now you can see that this

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,500
field to become valid so here is the my

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,520
final demo that I'm just quickly gonna

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:19,210
show you this one is a custom async

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,510
validator sometimes I need to query some

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:24,220
asynchronous process to validate my form

00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,590
right everything you've done so far has

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,060
been synchronous right can anybody think

00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,650
of a case where you need to do an

00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,180
asynchronous validation maybe

00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:35,170
what you do at work or you can think of

00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,920
any one username is taken exactly you

00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,080
want to make sure

00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,090
okay this pass is filling this form with

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,070
a username called man's not hot let me

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,780
see if Matt's not hot is actually taken

00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,340
so that I don't have to send and some

00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,530
actually some companies even reserve

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,790
that for like I think a minute while

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,620
you're feeling it from sort of somebody

00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:52,600
else that wants to use man's not hot

00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,670
doesn't you know come and just push you

00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,200
off the way like a cue I guess airlines

00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,420
do something like that right you have a

00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,710
seat you're picking the seat make sure

00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,140
the seat is there they give you like I

00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,880
think five minutes it depends if you

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:07,750
like one of those like Ryan air they

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,790
don't really care exactly they don't

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,070
really care about a if you got like your

00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:14,350
fancy like that so here what I'm doing

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:18,090
I've created a form that basically says

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:20,860
it's using the API called zippopotamas

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,600
has anybody heard of zippopotamas zip

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,190
apart on the US it's actually the free

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,780
API that allows you to create post codes

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,600
of like I think 40 countries

00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,010
so yeah UK and all of that but I'm

00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,220
actually using the u.s. one so I've

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:36,130
created this form field to only be valid

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,260
if you live in California

00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,270
if you don't live in California two

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:43,540
Broke can be delivering to you sorry

00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:47,190
so that kind of thing but basically now

00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:50,020
I need to I'm always querying

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,420
zippopotamas to give the zipper part

00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,100
time as your zip code as they call it in

00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,300
America and then I'm getting like some

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,430
information that it gives it gives you

00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,080
place long as you latitude and then I'm

00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,170
always making sure that you your

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,520
postcode actually matches you know

00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:05,830
California and then then I'm making that

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,780
phone so at some point my form is

00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,180
actually waiting in its Ana state court

00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,940
pending waiting for the asynchronous

00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:15,510
requests to succeed so let's actually

00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,640
test this live so can anybody think of a

00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:21,820
like a non Californian postcode by any

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:26,590
chance three three one four five

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:29,140
okay three three one four five yep sorry

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,760
you gotta live in Beverly Hills so I

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,680
think I know the Beverly Hills one now I

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,830
know two one oh don't ask me how I know

00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,830
that

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,780
so if you see that it says we delivered

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,330
to you address and you can have a look

00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:45,090
at the code here what am i doing I've

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,280
created what I call a custom acing

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,230
validator here state delivery right and

00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,150
I'm even saying this acing validated has

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,220
a dependency called HTTP which is the

00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,200
HTTP client of angular that's like in

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,630
react I think you'd use a either fetch

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,370
API or Axios I think it's called right

00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,950
now yeah that kind of thing just make

00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:04,140
that connection yeah so and I'm just

00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,510
busy saying okay inject that into this

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,730
function and that function is going to

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,070
return you the instance of the form

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:14,310
control and I'm just saying go make that

00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,650
HTTP request to there and you know I'm

00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:19,560
using our xjx here and I'm saying get

00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:21,060
the state if the state is equal to

00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,400
California what it's returning then

00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:25,650
we're good so we're not gonna return

00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,180
anything but if it's not then return an

00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,890
error because it's only one it's not I

00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,230
want to actually return an error so

00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,420
again the false case is true that the

00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,640
true case is false and that's what we're

00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,740
doing but this is a live API request

00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:46,770
does anybody want to try any other post

00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:51,120
and zip codes any nine nine four seven

00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:52,590
oh four oh look at you fancy deliver to

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,300
you for sure I'm not delivering anything

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,660
you really wouldn't want me to be your

00:27:54,300 --> 00:28:01,230
delivery guy your packages will be late

00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:03,930
but yeah so that kind of like is the

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,430
gist of what reactive forms offer but

00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,170
there's so much more that they allow you

00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:10,650
to this is just literally the entry and

00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:13,680
allows you to really create complex form

00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:16,640
based applications so let's go back to

00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,640
where I got my ass kicked

00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:28,440
how'd you do this I think I need to move

00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:29,940
this up and then out oh all right so we

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,430
talked about the value change the built

00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,630
in validation the composition the custom

00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,820
validation also I'm going to share this

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:38,070
slide and every single example is

00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,650
available my stack blades even like the

00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:42,270
the forms the bad forms there's a link

00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,010
in there so you can go check it out it's

00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:47,490
available using the latest version of

00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,880
angular and so to get started today you

00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,500
can

00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,179
again go to my stack please for all the

00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,220
links you can go to the angular your

00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:56,390
guides you can ask me a question on

00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,710
Twitter I am opinionated so be careful I

00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:01,679
think that's probably a given so

00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:05,039
variable knob but hey you know everybody

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,960
9 out of 10 like my mom would say and I

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,760
also teach you that in the bootcamp so

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,910
if you're interested feel free to to

00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:15,730
head out there and yeah if there are any
