	Introduction to Computer Vision(open CV) in JS // Italo Jose Goncalves De Oliveira

Do you wanna know computer vision but don't know Python? Are you in a project that needs to be coded in a fast way and can't use a custom deep learning model?

In this talk, we will see how the classical computer vision works and how a computer vision engineer can solve many problems in a fast and easy way than deep leaning. Everything in Javascript!
