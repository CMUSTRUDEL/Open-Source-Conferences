Title: 100% CSS Mario Kart - JS Monthly - July 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-06
Playlist: JS Monthly London
Description: 
	100% CSS Mario Kart // Stephen Cook

Do you enjoy CSS? Do you enjoy retro games? Have you ever wanted to combine the 2, in such a way that the CSS Working Group will cry and ask you to stop? Then this is the talk for you!

This talk will go over some cool CSS features and techniques, and pushes them to their limits. You will learn how to use some of these techniques in the real world (and hopefully when not to use them, such as in a mad attempt to clone a beloved retro game with a wildly unsuitable toolset).
