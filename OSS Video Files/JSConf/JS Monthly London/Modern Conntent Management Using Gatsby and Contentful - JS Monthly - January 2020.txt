	Modern content delivery using Gatsby and Contentful \\ Beau Allison

Over the past year Trussle (https://trussle.com) has migrated to a Contentful and Gatsby stack - taking advantage of statically generated pages using a headless CMS and modular components. This talk examines the design, architecture, implementation and measures the impact on content editors and SEO in a fintech startup.

Beau is a Tech Lead at Trussle. He works on optimising and streamlining the workflows for both advisers and customers. In his spare time he loves to build static sites; most recently https://seventyfive.cl
