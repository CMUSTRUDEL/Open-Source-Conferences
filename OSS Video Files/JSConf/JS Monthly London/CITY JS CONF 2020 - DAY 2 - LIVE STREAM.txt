CityJS Conference is a JavaScript festival across London, a joint event from London's JavaScript meetups, including London JS Community, JS Monthly, Halfstack and Node User Group.

This is a fantastic opportunity for the JavaScipt community, and for those aiming to stay in touch with the industry, to be updated on innovative changes around the industry and JS as an entity. You can absorb knowledge while hopping on and off thought-provoking workshops and talks - this is possibly the most central and reasonably priced event to attend in London.
