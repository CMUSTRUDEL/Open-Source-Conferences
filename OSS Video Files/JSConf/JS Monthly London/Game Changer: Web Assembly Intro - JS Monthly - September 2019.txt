Title: Game Changer: Web Assembly Intro - JS Monthly - September 2019
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: JS Monthly London
Description: 
	Presented by Ram Sharma.

The topic will cover why Web Assembly (.wasm) is a game changer and why we should care? To give you more context - Web apps written with WebAssembly can run at near-native speeds because, unlike JavaScript, all the code a programmer writes is parsed and compiled ahead of time before reaching the browser. The browser then just sees low-level, machine-ready instructions it can quickly validate, optimize, and run. The session will contain majorly demos and real time coding experience.
