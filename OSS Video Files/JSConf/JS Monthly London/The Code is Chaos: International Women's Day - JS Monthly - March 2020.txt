okay hi everyone and welcome to the code

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:07,259
is chaos no one is immune

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,970
so I'm Sonia I work dark cooties so I'm

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,969
RELIGIOUS security engineer so I wanted

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,620
to start by giving a short description

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,139
of what is cyber security and why is it

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,210
important so cyber security is the

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,680
techniques of protecting computers that

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,539
works programs and data from

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,699
unauthorized access or attacks that are

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,490
aimed for exploitation I'll give some

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,730
examples of cyber attack so the first

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:33,059
one is that one so might be wondering

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,100
that's the gate have 500 error page so

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,870
basically what happened there so four

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,520
years ago there was a series of DDoS

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,809
attack that were launched against DNS

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,690
servers and it disrupted all of those

00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:48,870
platforms so github PayPal clear Spotify

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,930
so one is a DDoS attack so detail stands

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,860
for a denial distribution of service so

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,800
basically an attacker would actually

00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:01,440
gets and hand on several computers that

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,090
they will actually bots and zombie fine

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,619
and then launch the attack against

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,140
resources and just exhausted those

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,320
resource and assets sounds a little bit

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,530
scary how can attack her do this

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,640
actually so who here is similar with the

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,229
website called showdown okay so

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,400
basically showdown is a search engine

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:27,900
for Internet connected devices so Africa

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,450
it's quite small earthquake web cam in

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,100
the search inputs and this is all I get

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,500
so basically it's all the web cam

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,450
connected with default credentials just

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,509
open to the internet so open to the word

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,610
so that's always carry actually what are

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,640
you some even more scary is that you can

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,740
actually get wave you have images

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,899
obviously a reductive if this is what he

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,880
can actually get from from show to also

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,009
gets a stuff like endorse but it won't

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,110
obviously to put it but you can also

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,560
imagine what you can find it's like yeah

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,750
that's really scary another example of

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,210
cyberattack is any mind probably

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,670
familiar with it to spread somewhere so

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,770
what is it read somewhere attack so

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,770
basically the attacker will send the

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,980
phishing email and the user will click

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,720
on the link and on the background

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,069
you'll have the malware downloading on

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,870
your machine and then it will encrypt

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,200
your data and you have to paint bitcoins

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,349
to have your data encrypted so this was

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,819
the they want to cry ransomware this is

00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:28,420
the largest attack for him to run

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:30,340
somewhere and it hits 130 countries

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,000
until that's the biggest ransomware

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:37,390
attack another example for a cyber

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,690
attack is sextortion so sexy thing like

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,849
that but basically yeah the attacker

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,010
will send you an email by the way that's

00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:48,190
the scam so probably receive that email

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,410
in your spam box so basically the

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,650
attacker will send you an email saying

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,030
that he hasn't stole something in a

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,650
computer to record than you've been

00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,970
doing that's just off and he recorded

00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,799
everything and it's gonna send it to

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,410
your family your friends your your

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:03,730
employer and you need to pay bitcoins

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,549
Chris otherwise it's gonna be really

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,799
nasty for you and you can see that the

00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:12,190
little burner bit at the top that's the

00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:15,959
password so huh I was this happening

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:18,819
actually so what do you can check is

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,829
yeah on website like have I been poned

00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,139
instead of having I love just mouth they

00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,690
just put your email address and see the

00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:29,230
which accounts or companies you have

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:32,440
been part of the data bridge so how data

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,930
breach appear so usually an attacker

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,090
will fellow what we call a cyber kill

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,340
chain so we started by doing a little

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,660
bit of recon at first to get our some

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,389
information to know more about the

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,209
targets then it will weaponize it create

00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,280
a payload to attack the the websites or

00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,500
the application or network then it will

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,680
deliver the payloads they will explode

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,840
so the the pillow will be installing the

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,359
machine they can do also pivoting

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,129
through the network so to gain admin

00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:02,700
access so basically it's like yeah

00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:05,470
detect pods if they're getting access

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,060
and then they will depend if it's for

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:11,859
data breach obviously is to exfiltrate

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:15,340
all the data so yeah basically the the

00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:16,840
attacker in this case can get

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,849
information through social engineering

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,070
so through a phishing email attack for

00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:21,970
example or looking at the infrastructure

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,980
of vulnerability

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,500
is through sequel injection through

00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,020
cursor scripting all of those once the

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,420
attacker find an entry points then it

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,250
will attack and it's filtering all the

00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,790
data and obviously selling they down the

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,050
dark web is a way of getting money this

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,450
is just an example of some of the

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,690
companies that suffer a data breach the

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:47,020
lots pretty sure you already use a lot

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:49,360
of them another way of visualizing the

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,910
data breaches you could see like big

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,270
thing ever is just from Twitter Facebook

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:58,480
elders so I want to talk about one web

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:01,840
application attack just for ease of hang

00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,660
who thinks which company I'm talking

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,900
about with only 22 lines of codes and

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,490
you have 380,000 victims do you know

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:14,590
which company I'm talking about

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:17,680
in that case no just guess so it was

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,000
British Airways actually wait only 22

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,360
lines of codes and I'm going explain it

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,640
way so in 2018 British Airways announced

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,010
it has suffered at theta breach also

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,130
announced it on Twitter so they noted

00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,590
that less than 400,000 customers could

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,300
have been effective and they have stolen

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:38,200
information including personal and

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,200
payment information so payments to their

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,750
main website were affected payments

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,020
through their Android and iOS mobile

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:49,240
apps were affected and the payments were

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,870
affected from August 21st to September

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,960
the 5th so within two weeks the attack

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,870
was the first so what happened during

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,940
those two weeks actually so we've seen

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,710
that customer data were stolen directly

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,620
from payment form so basically when the

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,000
user were submitting the form

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,970
they'd think that were actually siphoned

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,530
by the the attacker and we could see

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,560
that the same type of cyber attack

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:17,800
happened when Ticketmaster UK reported a

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,160
breach few months earlier so we could

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,470
see a pattern there and actually a

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,590
security researcher found out that it

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,140
was a group called Beach carts that was

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,220
the main suspect and you're like meet

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,010
you

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,840
are we talking about so major is a

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,750
consortium of malicious hacker groups

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,420
who target online shopping cart systems

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,390
to steal payment card information and

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,290
they quite well-known by targeting the

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,150
prima Kohl magenta which is a PHP

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,680
framework and this is know as a supply

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,470
chain attack because they're targeting

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,460
third party imagined packages so what

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,650
was the entry point

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,980
there's also another question can you

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,110
guess which JavaScript package allowed

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,280
them to actually had that I'm sure point

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,050
have I guess no so it was more noisy

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,100
well I guess a JavaScript library

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,670
version two point six point two yeah so

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,800
basically what happened the the attacker

00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:20,290
appended a snippet of code at the ends

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,880
of the scripts so they usually do this

00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,500
because probably they're not really good

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,210
cooter and they don't want to break the

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,470
logic so they will append it at the end

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,690
so they don't really touch the

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,660
functionality but still be malicious

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,840
attack malicious piece of code is there

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,669
and how can we actually see that the

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,169
modern era has been temporary with so

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,419
basically the server sent a last

00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:42,040
modified header they will indicate the

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,990
last time a piece of static content has

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,640
been modified so at the top you could

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,300
see that this was the last version of

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,790
moderniser

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,919
and this was actually the piecework ava

00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,930
has been tempered with the EBC it's 2018

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,180
21st of august this is what actually the

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:59,140
attack started and this was the piece of

00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:01,630
code only 22 lines of code it's amazing

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,640
so basically photos who don't get what's

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,470
then piece of code is all about so

00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,810
basically when a user hits the button to

00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,940
submit the payments the info from the

00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,440
payment form is extracted alongside with

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,690
their name and sent to the attacker

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,970
server which is this one does address

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,630
surrogate holding Commission and that

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:22,300
address and they've also created a

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,790
specific website and resistor everything

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,790
to actually get all of those info just

00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,220
like be a waste of code so what about

00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:33,339
the apps because okay we get that is for

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,110
the the website it was modernizer so

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,719
basically portion of the app is native

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:40,000
so with Android and iOS but the majority

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,310
of its functionality lives from web

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,220
pages from the official British Airways

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,080
website

00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,150
so for those of you who died similar

00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,220
with a native app you can actually use

00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,200
those classes in Android and iOS called

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,880
web views which allow you to actually

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,570
inject JavaScript directly within your

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,340
native app so this was the page for

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,560
British Airways service compromised

00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,660
and if we look at the source that could

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,030
source up this web page is the same CSS

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,400
and same JavaScript components as the

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:11,630
websites that we're back with monetize

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,890
learning same attack so what happened

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,980
after that

00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,540
well Mozilla had to also reissue some of

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:21,050
the cards to prevent fraud for their

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,730
customers but for British Airways that

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,080
could find C another 30 Mille and on

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,810
there are DB power for data bridge

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,940
that's really bad so you're wondering

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,440
how can I protect my website because I

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,380
don't want this to happen in my company

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,180
good news you have tools you have

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,150
security features and security tools so

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,370
let's go first with a security features

00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:43,520
so who here is familiar with content

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,410
security policy in its yes be cool so

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,570
for those who are not familiar the CSP

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,010
is a HTTP response header and will

00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,470
restrict our resources such as

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,270
JavaScript CSS and all the other assets

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,860
that you have on your website a loaded

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,050
by the browser it will mitigates

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,450
injection attacks including corrosive

00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:03,050
scripting so basically you would have

00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:05,540
something like so the the asset will go

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,850
so you will have a white list of all the

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,560
SS they will allow on the page and if

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,300
you have something like Malaysia cell

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,410
phone which is not in your example.com

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,610
it won't be loaded by the by the browser

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,610
so you have a good website called

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,470
content security policy calm easy to

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,510
remember they actually go through all of

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,030
the version of the different CSP they

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,910
can find is just like three versions at

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:31,100
the moment with all the the browser that

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:35,000
are supporting those there's quite a

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,190
good coverage for that the the website

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,680
also goes through all of the directive

00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,610
that you can use so depending on the the

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,730
assets that you have on your website

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,770
should it be JavaScript fonts images you

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,570
have a directive for each of them and

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,060
also the value that you want to assign

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,560
to it and they will also give you

00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,580
examples

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,650
so for those of you who are wondering

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,930
how you could widely sold say like

00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,880
Google tags management or your

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:03,460
third-party marketing they'll also give

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:06,560
me examples oh it also recommends is

00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,270
before pushing live on production your

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,279
csps to do a little bit of fine-tuning

00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,600
at first because it might probably break

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,490
your website because you can't really

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,910
why place all of your handset on the

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,430
first try so we're going to use websites

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:22,339
like report your I where you have report

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,260
only for your CSB and it will you

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:26,000
actually have an endpoint where Li you

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,860
will collect all the errors and it will

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,130
help you actually fine-tune your CSV and

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,260
then you can ship it to to live at your

00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,520
problem

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,529
another great security feature is

00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,740
supersaurus integrity who here is

00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:42,920
familiar with it's alright

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,540
okay so there are sorry enables browser

00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,610
to verify that resource they are

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,710
fetching from a CDN are delivered

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,160
without being tempered and they're using

00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,660
actually a hash cryptographic hash so

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,670
basically you would have something like

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,670
let's say you have a script with the

00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,350
hash and if it's from a CDN they'd

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,000
recognize it so it's fine but because

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,280
here we have an attacker manipulating

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,540
the server we have a different hash so

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,790
it won't actually load it through the

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,160
dirty browser to give you an example

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:13,070
this is bits row who's using bootstrap

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,810
is just to give you an example so you

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,120
would see actually for a jQuery and the

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:20,390
other you have this integrity hash the

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,440
show 384 so this is to prove actually

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:26,450
the integrity of this script if the

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,250
third party doesn't provide you this

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,040
Sahra you can actually generate it and

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,050
append it to your scripts so those good

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,940
websites are hashed iterator that will

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:38,030
help you generate this hash

00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:41,440
there's also a good coverage for the

00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:43,700
browser so yeah it's a good production

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,350
let's go through security tools now

00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,940
because I've present to you the security

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,550
features with the year the CSP in this

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,140
re so you'll be very familiar with the

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,980
dependency graph and the penta bots on

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,660
github

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,420
where's the by the way there's free

00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,180
tools for that so the dependency graph

00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:02,150
is available on every public repository

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,410
by default you have two activities for

00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,180
your primary purpose

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,160
and that will define dependencies in a

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,700
spray language using a support flats

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,050
permits so this little eight is because

00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,779
they've actually added some languages

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:18,200
and some formats but in kiss it it's it

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:20,270
covers a lot of languages so so yeah

00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,190
let's say for like yarn or NPM they'll

00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:25,010
go through your package stays and like

00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,709
you know if there's any packages that

00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,720
have fun their abilities if you have a

00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:32,570
private repo what you can do is go to do

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,860
your repo go to your insights tab click

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,220
on the pencil graph and just allow

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,110
access and then it will start being the

00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,670
thing with the pen see gravel just have

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,470
like a yellow books at the top of the

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,300
repo and you'll list you'll ask yourself

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,860
yeah that's cool that I don't really

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,890
know which version I have to pray to

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,600
well good news because github as a cried

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:54,339
Akari dependables

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,990
so dependable actually will erase

00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:59,899
automatically a pull request and let you

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,089
know to which version you can upgrade by

00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,560
the way you can find so they see where

00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,899
you can find upon the book through the

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,829
marketplace but also through the other

00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:12,529
settings in your repo so they find about

00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:14,839
rule of raise pull requests and they can

00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:17,029
go to which version you have to update

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,589
it and the good thing with dependable

00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:20,839
it's actually what they call the

00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:22,880
compatibilities court so basically they

00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,680
will compare with other open source

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,200
projects and if it doesn't bring their

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,670
conc pipeline they'll bump up this this

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,800
card so you have more confidence to

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,560
emerge that that PR and you can also

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,260
link in sees link which is cool also

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,120
it's pretty much calorie so you can send

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,529
different features so depending on if

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,930
you want to target specific brands from

00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:44,870
specific language so there's a lot of

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:48,200
options that you can set through your

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:50,870
the config yeah both are as I had a tool

00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,070
of course link pretty much sure that you

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,720
you know how about snake

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,399
it's like those exactly the same thing

00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,200
guys they put the box so it's free for

00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:02,779
officers it's also free for a small

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,959
organization I think but then it's also

00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:08,770
a commercial tool after so also

00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:11,329
available on the github marketplace and

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,999
the good thing would stick is provides

00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:15,619
an online platform where you can see

00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:18,049
your repos and different vulnerabilities

00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:21,129
that you have weeding the repos and

00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:23,509
there's a piece of information detailing

00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,069
what is this vulnerability about it's

00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:27,669
just to give a little bit more info

00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:31,359
there's also cointegration woods like

00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:34,429
Sophia and you can also integrate it

00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:36,409
through your PR so depending at heart

00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:38,959
mature is your a CIC pipeline you can

00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:40,759
also make your bill fell this is really

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,470
depending on the maturity of your

00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,929
pipeline but you can make it required

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,069
and yeah make it fill

00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:47,779
maybe you've been interested by all of

00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:49,369
those and you know say I want to learn

00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,970
more about security who's to learn more

00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:54,259
about security here raise of hands yeah

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,739
so I would recommend a good starting

00:15:54,259 --> 00:16:01,399
point would be the odds foundation who

00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:03,769
here's Miller with all us okay cool so

00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,869
almost as for open web application

00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,789
security projects so we zip as a

00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:10,549
community of default print security

00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:13,879
researcher they'll provide a lot of

00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:17,479
resources and tools so you might even

00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:20,659
with the our top ten ten was critical

00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:23,449
usually they have like 2013 and 2017 the

00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:27,259
top ten they have it I would recommend

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:28,519
go beyond those top ten and just have a

00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,049
look at the other publication that I

00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,379
have so they have everything like

00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:34,729
through API mobile IOT name it you will

00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:37,429
find it and everything is free on their

00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:39,439
web sites are really good if you're

00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,839
interested if people to get your hands

00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:44,809
dirty I would recommend from all of us

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,089
they have a website called when a web

00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:51,829
application no GIS application severe

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:53,869
called app juice shop yeah so basically

00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:56,239
that's a vulnerable app that you can

00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:57,979
play around than just hack and you can

00:16:56,239 --> 00:17:00,079
also use always app which is a proxy

00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:03,409
that you can actually first was wrong

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,600
with on this application for example if

00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:08,299
you feel a little bit more adventurous

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,980
you know you can go to hack the box so

00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:12,379
basically hike the bus will provide with

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,019
a hundred box that you need to pull so

00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:18,470
basically you have two flags to find the

00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:20,120
roots and the the user so obviously if

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,620
you want to have the root you have to do

00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,059
some so like privileged escalation to

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,819
get admin access so there's little bit

00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:26,839
of a challenge around that but you will

00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:29,450
also need to

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:32,320
you actually set up your pen testing lab

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:35,900
so I would recommend to download

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,960
virtualbox to get your VM and then your

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,840
Kali Linux Debian and once you have you

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,669
set up your pen testing lab you can

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,950
start actually get your hands dirty on

00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:48,110
all of those machines you have Linux and

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,179
Windows machines it's quite interesting

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,700
actually to get all of this this lexus

00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:55,779
by the way this is called CTF captured a

00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:59,720
flag but at this I would also recommend

00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:01,899
port swagger which is the company who's

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,340
doing burp Suites so is the same as

00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:06,230
always out but more like commercials

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,990
might but you do have a web security

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,029
Academy with a lot of those attacks that

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,649
you usually hear about but you don't

00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:15,649
really get what it is so they have

00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:17,149
really good to Charles around that so I

00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:21,740
would recommend what security Academy

00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:24,529
and if you want to earn money by finding

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:27,830
bugs I have it recommends joining

00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:31,279
background hacker one so their card

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,649
sources platform where you act as a

00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,380
security researcher your will be part of

00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:39,320
programs and you can find bugs at

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,240
security bugs within companies and you

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,929
get paid for that so it's it's a great

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,580
great opportunity and they also have

00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:48,230
some so like Academy online platform

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,340
where you can actually learn about

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:54,500
hacking what we have occult packing and

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,440
if you work in a company and you have a

00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,899
security team and you're interested in

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,490
not necessarily moving to security but

00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:03,440
just being more involved and we

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,929
recommend ask them if they have a scary

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,049
champion program so basically who here

00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:12,230
is aware if the security champion

00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:13,580
program or is a scary champion ok so

00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,500
secure champion basically it's the

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,789
bridge between developers and this

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,039
period team because you really in your

00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:21,740
security team is quite small so these

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,919
curtain competence all of the a job

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,270
scrim ceremonies usually so it will it

00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,029
will develop this little security

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,679
chances Network and they will train them

00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:33,440
and probably like send them to

00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,370
conferences or events and they will just

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
act as the bridge

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,210
between the two teams it's quite

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,870
interesting if if your security team is

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,130
proposing it also for those who wants to

00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,830
learn more about security

00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,420
I broke the peace medium room how to

00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,970
become secure it's more about like

00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,070
gathering like podcasts YouTube channels

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,070
all of those in this article so if

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,770
you're curious about how it recommends

00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:01,130
yeah and also I have this initiative

00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:03,890
called epic women of cybersecurity so

00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,260
basically it's women working in

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,240
cybersecurity I wanted to give highlight

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,429
and increase like diversity inclusivity

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,750
for any woman working in cyber as crew

00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:12,950
because usually you have the big name so

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,500
you don't really have to you know the

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:18,260
other women if you're working the

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,570
rolling lights but they do a lot of good

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,990
things so yeah every week I actually

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,220
upload every Friday only if you it

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,170
happens that you work in cybersecurity

please come and tell me I can head you

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,360
