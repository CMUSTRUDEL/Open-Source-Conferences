	Sam Bellen - No way Jose

Is your first thought when thinking about cryptography, “nope, that’s not for me!”? There’s no need to. When explained with simple examples, you can see the basics are not that complicated. The JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption, or JOSE for short is a framework that helps us deal with encryption. It describes ways to securely transfer data either signed (JWS) or encrypted (JWE). Let’s take a leap of faith and explore the wonderful world of cryptography together, shall we?

What is Hashing? [00:02:31]
A hashing algorithm is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of an arbitrary size to bit string of a fixed size, which basically means that no matter how big the input you give to this algorithm, the output will always be of the same size and that size is depending on the algorithm. 

Hashing Algorithm [00:03:11] It's a one way function.
