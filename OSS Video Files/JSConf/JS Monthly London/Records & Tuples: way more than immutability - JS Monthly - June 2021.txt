Records & Tuples: way more than immutability
Sébastien Lorber

Records and Tuples is a stage-2 proposal that brings deeply immutable data structures to JavaScript. But immutability is only one part of the story: their "compound primitives" behaviour could be the most interesting part, and have a way significant impact. Through different examples, we will see how to use them, and what are the benefits for frontend applications and frameworks, in particular ReactJS.

Sébastien is a ReactJS freelancer.
Lately, he works for Facebook as the lead maintainer of Docusaurus, the Jamstack open-source documentation framework used by Jest, React-Native, Relay, Redux, Babel, Prettier and many more.

He became an early adopter of ReactJS in 2014, specialized in techno, and contributed to the growth of its open-source ecosystem. He is passionate about cross-platform development, especially through ReactNative.
