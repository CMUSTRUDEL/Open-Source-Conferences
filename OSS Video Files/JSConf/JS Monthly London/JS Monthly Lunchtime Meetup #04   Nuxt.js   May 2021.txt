Fast & Furious - Going headless with Nuxt.js! // Samuel Snopko: 11:38

This will be fast & furious! I will show you the fastest possible way to connect your Nuxt.js (Vue.js) project to the headless CMS and deploy it in seconds. You should know a thing or two about Nuxt.js, headless CMS in general or JAMstack as there will be no time to describe the concepts in detail. In the end, you will be furious at how insanely good the JAMstack is!
