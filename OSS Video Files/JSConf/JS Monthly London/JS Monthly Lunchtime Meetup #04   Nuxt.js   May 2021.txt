Fast & Furious - Going headless with Nuxt.js! // Samuel Snopko: 11:38

This will be fast & furious! I will show you the fastest possible way to connect your Nuxt.js (Vue.js) project to the headless CMS and deploy it in seconds. You should know a thing or two about Nuxt.js, headless CMS in general or JAMstack as there will be no time to describe the concepts in detail. In the end, you will be furious at how insanely good the JAMstack is!

[Music]

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,399

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,040
terrace and uh yeah

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,800
the event the london the city.js

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,399
conference in london like even it was

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,920
online was really nice and i can

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,000
encourage you to check it out

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,600
so if you never heard about or you never

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,839
saw it uh so there was like

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,440
a few pretty awesome talks and even the

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,680
the online venue was very

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,200
very cool but let's back to the my talk

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,120
and why i'm here today

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,079
so as a researcher my name is samuel

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,480
snopko and i'm going to talk today about

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,399
the nakjas and how we are going to build

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,839
basically a website from a scratch with

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,519
a headless solution

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,360
and uh headless solution will be the

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,200
storyblock in this case and it will be

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,399
fast and furious so probably if you know

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,399
a thing

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,399
or one or two things about the nexus it

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,160
will help you but even if you don't know

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,560
anything about the next it's okay

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,760
because uh it's a javascript framework

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,600
and you should be able to understand

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,360
everything what i will be showing

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,639
so first slide uh of course is something

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,040
about me so who i am

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,680
uh i'm just my name is already like on

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,399
the screen

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,480
and i stole it i'm the head of the

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,519
developer relations at storyblock

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,160
and i'm also like big uh community

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,399
believer

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,920
uh and i was like uh working on uh

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,680
living in germany helping

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,680
to different communities and uh like

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,600
also the meetups and then also like kind

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,279
of a nice jazz so i'm like kind of

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
ambassador of the night jess i'm big fan

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,600
of it

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,600
and uh and why i think like ended where

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,760
i'm ended it's also like

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,360
always like doing a front end and i was

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,880
very very interesting into the design

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,639
also bridging the gap between the

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,320
developers and the designers

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,760
and i think like with the headless

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,079
approach and atomic

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,920
design uh which is also like part of the

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,000
headless decoupled approach

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,440
is the reason why i'm where i meant at

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,959
the moment but that's enough

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,320
about me let's jump to the talk

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,560
so uh the talk uh we are not going to do

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,480
a lot we are a lot of slides we are

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,040
going to just go for light coding if you

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,839
want to follow me and if you want to

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,880
follow

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,880
what i'm going to do

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,360
uh we can follow this github link here

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,760
at storyblock

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,600
slash talk blazingly fast the nagjes i

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,560
just updated it like few minutes ago

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,639
with laters

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,399
release from the storyblock next bridge

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,079
so this is the first time you will also

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,760
be able to see the version do

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,279
uh in the preview or in the talk

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,199
so how to start with nigest that's the

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,680
first big question that everybody should

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,519
ask

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,920
and i'm also answering like use uh the

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,959
yarn create next step or npm create the

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,560
knack as next step

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,320
you can build your own like starting

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,839
point or like starting scenarios but

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,920
this is the best way you can do

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,000
because like the next and all the modern

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,680
technologies are developing so fast that

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,519
they have like every time like new

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,760
versions and you just

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,639
can't get uh you cannot be all the like

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,320
on the edge

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,519
so here you just like choose your name

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,399
i'm still going to forget about

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,639
javascript

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,760
and then a package manager will be like

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,320
yarn in this case

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,079
and i'm going for a tailwind so let's

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,399
choose talent

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,600
uh of course we will need axios which is

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,440
already installed and axions

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,360
of course needed for the communication

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
between the storyboard the headless cms

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,680
and the next so i'm going to choose that

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
uh at this moment we are not going to

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,639
choose

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,079
any lending tools because uh it's uh for

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,720
the purpose of this talk it will be like

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,639
just making

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,760
everything more complicated so no

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,440
testing also

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,360
uh we are of course going for the server

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,839
side running or servers uh

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
or static site generation so universal

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,720
in this case

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,160
and i would uh go for and recommend you

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,440
for go for the james deck

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,120
or if you want to deploy to versailles

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,600
netlify or any other

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,040
uh third-party services as i am using

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,880
the ps code i'm also

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,320
going to use a chase config and after

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,399
this setup

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,160
and uh adding also like your github name

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,600
and basically control system

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,079
you will be uh your uh you will be added

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,720
or like

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,680
get it to the project like this so here

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,959
is exactly

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,959
what i did uh is the the next step

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,720
is this uh repository here in this

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,560
repository i already started the rear

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,040
dev so you can see it's my local host

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,040
running

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,240
and then all this i do just because i

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,160
want to save some time

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,240
because otherwise this presentation will

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,880
be even more than 40 minutes

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,639
so here first of all what we should do

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,040
is check out our localhost so let's

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,120
check

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,519
out if everything is running okay on the

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,279
localhost and as you can see here i see

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,519
my welcome screen from the local host

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,959
and basically my application is ready to

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,079
be deployed to the

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,360
netlify or reversal so i can just start

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,880
deploying if you would like to

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,320
but of course this is just a static

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,120
website that is built directly in the

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,959
nexus

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,480
here in the index.js and this is

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,120
basically the welcome screen from the

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,639
next team

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,040
where you can go to documentation on

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,079
github so what else what is the next

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,240
step we need to do

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,079
the next step we need to do is basically

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,120
going to storyblock and somewhere create

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,040
our content

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,800
so and the question is like how we can

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,720
create the content

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,480
uh so we are going to use a storyblock

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,079
in this case and i'm going to create

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,839
everything from scratch so let's imagine

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,279
that i just registered a storyblock and

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,480
i have a new

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,079
uh new new account here and i want to

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,079
create a fresh new space so i'm just

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,920
clicking on the create new space

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,600
i'm choosing a new space and then i'm

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,480
just adding here as some name

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,040
so just to don't do a lot of typos i'm

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,959
just

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,120
will be copying a lot of stuff from my

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,800
cheat sheet on the left side

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,279
and here you can see that i'm just

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,839
creating a new project

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,360
and of course i have reached the limit

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,440
of all of the plans so this is the

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,279
because i have like too many demos

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,439
so give me a second i just in live

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,400
screen live stream i will

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,480
remove one demo space and then i can

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,240
create a new one again

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,559
so and even still

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,480
this always happened in the live stream

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,839
that something

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,079
is happening give me a second i will

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,600
just remove all of the demo spaces i

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,600
just created

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:33,840
and now let's do to be sure to reload

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,840
i will be ah come on

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,360
this can happen only in the live stream

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,200
so don't worry i am also preferred for a

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,320
alternative version if this wouldn't

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,440
work

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,799
so i just didn't know that i have

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,760
so many spaces in my name so let's try

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,679
one more time

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,880
and to be sure to clear cache if there

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,039
is like somewhere

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,559
double checking and create new space one

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,200
more time from a scratch

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,960
and add here some test but there

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,600
shouldn't be any problem

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,120
and okay i'm still reaching the limit

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,120
over all my spaces

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,160
so what i'm going to do right now is i'm

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,000
going to present that

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,360
all in the the uh space i have here so

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,360
my talk space

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,679
so for this case i have here also the

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,280
thought basically fast the neck jazz

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,960
so here you can see that i just entered

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
the next space uh

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,000
the space of my project and in this

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,919
project

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,360
you can see that i have some options of

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,400
course one of the option is that i can

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,919
go to the content

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,840
where you can already see the final

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,480
stage of the project that i would be

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,440
building

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,960
before your eyes but as uh we cannot i

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,000
cannot create a fresh space at the

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,280
moment i have to do

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
this so now here in the home if i click

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,360
on the home

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,080
i'm entering the empty space and i

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,760
am i see here also my local host and why

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,600
do i see here the local host

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,440
is because i already connected my

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,160
localhost is this uh

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,360
in this paragraph space so how does it

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,080
exactly work

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,520
so here in the settings uh the first

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,600
thing you have to understand is like

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,600
if i remove this localhost environment

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,679
then i will see nothing here

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,640
so let's change this to the uh to the

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,760
empty url

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,960
or just do a google url

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,919
that we have a kind of fresh start

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,320
and let's go to the content and show you

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,160
that

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,679
here is an iframe where i can show at

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,440
the different pages

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,200
at the moment i am not showing any page

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,559
and why i am not sharing any page is

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,760
that i want to recreate

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,440
the whole the whole experience for you

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,000
from the fresh start

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,799
so what is the next step the next step

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,240
and i'm now

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,760
a little bit improvising i'm looking

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,520
what i should show you is to

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,520
pre-assemble content

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,120
so the sample content here on the home

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,440
page is i could see here on the right

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,600
hand side i have a teaser and grid

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,799
and this is the visual part so here in

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,480
the teaser i can start

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,039
editing my content so i have a hello

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,360
world i can do like

00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:03,440
hello.js monthly

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,360
monthly i can go back i can also like

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,200
change the features in my grid but i

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,720
don't see any pro in my visual editor so

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,919
theoretically i could like hide also the

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,559
visual editor and just

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,360
enjoy just the four-wheel of my uh of my

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,120
website

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,120
i could also like already like save this

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,679
content and i could already publish this

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,520
content

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,679
so i would get like draft jsons or

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,400
publish json that are available to be

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,919
through the

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,799
api so in this case if i would open like

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,840
the draft json

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,760
you can see the draft content of your

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,280
space or of your project that you would

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,400
get and according to this

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,000
content you are able to use nexus or

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,960
any other framework to render your

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,640
website pretty simple i think

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,000
so and this is i also like i think it's

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,880
quite straightforward

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,120
so what i did now that i make this

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,080
working so i don't get here like just

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,480
a random uh error so what i need to do

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,200
here

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,880
is like go to my local host and i want

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,760
to show their localhost so i have a

00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,280
localhost

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,360
and to show there are the locals which

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,360
you already like show so

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,559
it's just i need to go to my settings

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,799
and change the preview

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,799
environment here to localhost and

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,840
localhost this can be any uh

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,919
look any uh url i can even also create

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,120
like multiple player urls so here i

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,480
could like have like

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:22,559
a development location

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,960
and i could also have a production

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,640
so like this and now if i save it by

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,919
default i should be uh

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,520
i should see the content of the

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,360
localhost but this could be also like

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,799
the netlify or virtual url

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,200
and then if i go here to the home page

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,080
i see my localhost right this makes

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,760
sense but

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,760
there is also one catch i'm always

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,280
showing is that i'm here already

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,280
overriding something because

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,640
i have here this real path and if we

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,840
remove this real part which is

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,240
just all right for my home page

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,960
then i should get also like error here

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,280
but as

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,320
at the moment you can see that i am

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,360
getting still the whole

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,039
if i open it now i get a next error and

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,799
why i'm getting this next error and this

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,640
is also like important if you are trying

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,720
to recreate what i am doing today

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,480
is that here the next js at the moment

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,640
doesn't know the slack home

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,000
so i will get to that also in a second

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,240
because in the next project

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,760
i have only index.view so basically

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,400
that's the empty slash

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,520
so that's why we have a way to override

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,039
a visual editor

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,640
and to override the visual editor you

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,679
can change here the real path

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,080
to the slash because the home uh

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,600
should be always like name somehow so if

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,880
now i reload i should see

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,039
my localhost i see my localhost and

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,120
why uh there is a name home is that

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,640
because in the next chess if i would

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,960
like to require

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
a request this content i need to ask

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,600
like hey give me the content of the

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,400
whole

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,120
great so let's uh at the moment as you

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,280
can see

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,600
we have a content here which i can get

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,280
through the json or rest api or graphql

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,640
but in the case of knuckles we are going

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,760
to use the rest api

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,600
and we already also integrated that we

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,760
have our preview so we don't need to

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,000
have a special localhost tab here

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,679
because we see our localhost directly in

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,480
the storyblock app

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,400
parade but we still don't see what

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,919
exactly is that so we don't spray

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,240
the content from the right hand side

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,480
from the content editor

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,480
to do that we need to do a one a small

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,559
thing so we need to install

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,400
a packages i already installed them but

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,200
to make it easy for you

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,799
i just show you to it or also so what do

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,240
we need to install is the

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,960
yarn storage block next module so it's

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,360
like

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,480
yarn at storyblock next and the

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,880
storyblock uh next

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,840
module will uh it's already created by

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,080
the storyblock team

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,760
and this uh was also like updated like

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,440
two weeks ago so we have like newest

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,039
version like major update

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,480
and we are updating all of our tutorials

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,000
at the moment so some of them still are

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,600
using the version number one

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,440
so and now if i go to yarndev

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,960
i can start also my project so what's

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,360
happened here is that

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,919
it was added to the package.json my

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,000
storyblock nooks

00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:07,360
2.01 and then of course if i go

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
to the config of the star nokia nexus

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,919
i can also use the storyblock max module

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,480
and i can use storyblock next module to

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,440
connect

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,799
uh next project to the storyblock so

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,520
here in the modules

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,080
i am going to uncomment this code where

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,159
i am like

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,440
configuring the storyboard next module

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,840
and as you can see here

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,200
i need my aster block space token to

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,679
access my data

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,159
so let's get the storyblock space token

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,760
so to get us personal space token

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,000
i need to go to the settings of my space

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,520
and here in the api keys i can see that

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,520
this is my prerequisite

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,120
so the pro going to give you the draft

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,880
version of the data but you of course

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,000
can also create a public token which

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,640
would give you the published

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,360
uh data and you can create uh so many

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,039
tokens and

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,640
as you need and you can also like this

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,159
way create the tokens for different

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,080
different environments like if you're

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,720
like redesigning environments or stuff

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,960
like that

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,720
and to keep track where and which is

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,679
were used

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,799
so let's copy this token and let's go

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,720
back to the next

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,039
so i'm going to add it directly to the

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
config.js but i'm not recommending to do

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,840
it

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,520
uh in your projects uh anytime soon

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,919
because if you would do this uh

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,640
it's all also like published or like uh

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,480
it's going to do

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,840
your git uh repository and then

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,000
everybody will like see it

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,919
so use that and uh file for that as i

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,559
have here so if i would open a button

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,640
file

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,159
i would save my store token of course

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,840
here and then

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,200
i would load it directly as this

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,880
recommended by the next

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,120
and then also we can save it in netlify

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,320
or in the vet versa and use it as it

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,400
should be a used and secured way

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,360
so great i kind of connected the story

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,880
block with

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,720
uh the with the neck gest but if i go to

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,760
the content and open the home

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,240
i still see only the index uh index

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,919
uh page uh and the original one so i

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,400
still don't see my content so if you see

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,320
the here

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,919
the teaser there is like hello js

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,760
monthly and i don't see that

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,120
and even here in the grid i have a

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,480
features and i also

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,960
don't see those features so

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,880
what i need to do is today is to create

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,200
a component because you can see here

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,720
on this page which is a custom page

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,200
created by me for just

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,080
this demo and i ho attribute called

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,559
volley which

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,400
contains some components and i can see

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,840
all of my components in the component

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,000
section of the story block

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,000
so here are the components i see that i

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,919
have already article created

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,760
i created even a new component so not

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,559
only the default one which is pager

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,880
page t the grid and feature but i also i

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,360
have

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,120
article and featured articles let's

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,120
forget for some time the arctic and

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,960
featured article and focus on the

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,799
basic ones so here we have a teaser

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,320
which contains only a headline and it's

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,200
tight text so

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,720
no special nothing special just a

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,080
component called teaser which have one

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,480
property or one field

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,600
uh headline and you can fry the text

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,080
then i have a feature

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,919
which is also here just a component

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,120
called feature with one property or one

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,760
field called name

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,679
with type text then i have here a

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,440
special component called grid

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,080
are like special it's not a special

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,360
component the component with the special

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,400
field columns this is also the name of

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,720
the field

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,919
and the type of this field is a blocks

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,360
and blocks means that

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,360
you can nest or use in this field

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,480
any other components any other nest

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,399
stable components

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,520
because in story block as you could see

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,279
already we

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,440
we have two type of the components the

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,039
one are the content types

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,279
the second one are the next table

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,720
components so the next stable components

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,440
are basically the components that can be

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,480
nested in

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,679
other nest table components or other

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,080
content types

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,919
using the special field type blocks as

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,720
you can see on this grid so here

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,840
i can have a field called columns which

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,720
is types of blocks

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,760
i can and i can nest here any other nice

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,559
table component

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,880
but i can set also of some some rules

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,799
like

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,880
allow only specific components to be

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,399
inserted and i want to allow here

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,919
to be added only the features for

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,799
example and then i would just save the

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,720
schema of

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,720
my component and then i just edited a

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,880
component

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,960
and then i have a content types and by

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,799
uh i need at least one content type to

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,360
create a content because i need to

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,440
create

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,640
entries or stories how we call them in

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,120
the story blog

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,960
so here in the page is a content type

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,000
and the typical content types are like

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,480
article page

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,799
outdoor page uh landing page home page

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,360
etc so it's like types of the pages

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,120
but it doesn't have to be always a type

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,200
of the page it can be of something that

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,799
is not represented by a website

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,399
so for example author that is a

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,520
reference on different

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,600
articles and here this page is using the

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,120
same approach as the grid so here i have

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,279
a special field called body

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,240
because we have a body on every website

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,320
or every page

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,279
and it's typed blocks and i can use uh

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,760
their grid

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,919
these are or featured articles so let's

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,440
remove the our feature articles for now

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,480
i just keep it a little bit fresh

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,520
and now uh i set up basically my

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,840
structure so

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,120
if i go to the content and open the home

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,799
i can click add a block

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,120
and i can see that i can choose from the

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,520
grid and teaser to create something new

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,799
i can even like select my teaser i can

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,039
duplicate it

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,960
and i can do this stuff but i still

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,600
don't see the prairie

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,559
and i want to see that prior so so what

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,240
i need to do

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,399
is that i'm without delivering the

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,039
content through the json api

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,919
uh sorry rest api and that you can see

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,080
it also here

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,039
that i'm delivering like a body which i

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,360
already explained

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,279
which is an array of a component so here

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,720
is one first component and there is like

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,960
second one or

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,720
list of blocks and the first one is a

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,279
component type teaser with the text

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,760
headline

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,679
js monthly so exactly what you see here

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,799
a text hello js monthly

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,120
and this is the teaser in the page great

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,880
but

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,120
we don't have that same thing in the

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,480
next gest so i didn't grade in my

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,840
components until and then i just and

00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,159
that's the reason why i cannot render

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,559
them

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,080
so it's quite logical so let's do that

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,240
in the next chess

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,200
so what i need to do now is just go to

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,039
the components folder

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,320
and show you that i have those folder

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,480
components here

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,080
so you can see here i have a teaser

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,880
teaser component

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,320
which is very simple for the viewer so

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,520
i'm just expecting

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,080
a prop called block which is object and

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,039
using this block prop i will get all my

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,039
data

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,200
that i want to render here i'm just

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,720
using a little bit tail installing to

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,480
basically style h2 with where i'm going

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,120
to render my headline so block dot

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,960
headline

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,080
and this is how i'm going to get the

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,320
content the same goes for the future

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,520
so i have basically a simple block uh

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,159
prop

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,960
where i i'm expecting block and then i

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,840
have a very

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,240
simple div which where i am going to

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,640
render a h2 with the name

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,760
uh the grid is words get a little bit

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,600
more complicated

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,120
because i'm still getting my data to

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,000
block but in this case i don't know what

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,279
is the content

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,919
what components i added to the grid

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,559
so and because of that i am rendering a

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,600
list

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,240
under the list of uh la items or list

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,480
items

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,519
and these list items can be a different

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,640
dynamic

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,960
components in the view we have uh this

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,799
dynamic component which you can be used

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,919
and all you need to do is use this

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,120
special attribute

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,640
is and where if this is equal a teaser

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,559
you will render a teaser because i have

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,000
here that either if this would be a cool

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,640
the feature then you will render a

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,880
feature

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,960
so what is this block.component exactly

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,919
what i showed you already in the publish

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,720
json here

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,159
that this is the this obj this is the

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,640
object block basically

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,159
and here this component equal teaser is

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,760
what will be the block dot

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,000
component so here the block dot

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,320
component will return exactly this value

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,159
teaser and then i know that i should

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,240
render a teaser

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,000
and then i also send down the stream all

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,960
the other content

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,519
so okay that's doing the grid and almost

00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,840
the same

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,679
approach as for the page where i am also

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,440
like uh dynamically rendering

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,039
the body so here you can see that i'm

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,279
looping through the body so

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,480
i'm looped through the block dot body

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,159
where i am all

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,399
i have order of all my components on the

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,360
page and am just rendering them straight

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,679
forward

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,720
quite easy so what i need to do is of

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,559
course

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,919
all of my components here are basically

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,399
dynamic so i

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,840
have to tell the nexus to what

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,880
components i will be

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,440
rendering so i have i cannot cannot use

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
the

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,799
components true which is one of the

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
basic uh features of the next error

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,760
right now

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,120
but i have to like literally say to like

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,039
just hey expect that i

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,360
will be rendering these components and

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,360
that i will be doing using the plugin

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,480
so black the simplest way uh there's

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,399
like multiple ways how to do this but

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,799
the simplest way you can do it is

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,000
using the plugin in the next and it's uh

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,000
you just create a file called

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
component.js

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,760
where you import and register your

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,480
component so here you can see

00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,519
i am importing all of my components that

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,919
i just explained

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,159
and also like i'm registered in the view

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,880
that you know that okay i need to

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,640
render these components and the last

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,240
thing i need to do is going to the next

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,360
config and also like

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,000
uh like load this plugin so here in the

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,559
plugins

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,600
if i scroll up i should uncomment this

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,080
line

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,960
save it and i need to wait a little bit

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,000
that

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,200
this project will be rebuilt and then we

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,480
could and should see also like update so

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,760
close this

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,960
uh let's see reload here

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,919
and let's wait a second see if it's

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,200
it's already built and is there any

00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,440
update

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,200
and the answer is no there's no idea and

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,720
maybe some of you already noticed that

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,080
there is like makes sense why we don't

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,000
see any update here

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,200
and it's easy i register all the

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,880
components i

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,960
show you how to do how what are the

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,720
components doing but i didn't blow the

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,440
data in the next

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,000
so what i am talking about so here we

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,039
right now

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,480
see a index page and this index page

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,240
here in the view it has this code and

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,679
there's we didn't change never this code

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,440
so we'd never loaded anything

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,200
from the storyboard we just connected it

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,359
but we never said like hey i need

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,240
the content of the index page or of the

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,599
home

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,919
so what do we need to do now is

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,679
basically remove all this original call

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,040
from the next team

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,960
so here this code i just remove this

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,359
then i don't need to anymore show the

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,079
next logo so i'm going to also remove

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,720
this

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,800
i'm going to uncomment my code which i

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,119
will get back in second to

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,480
to tell you something about that and

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,359
then i need to save it

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,760
so that's it so what i did here is like

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,359
okay

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,119
i don't know like what kind of content

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,440
type i'm going to render so here i have

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,839
a dynamic i could replace it directly by

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,760
the page but if i would have like

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,079
multiple com

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,040
content types then i i need to like

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,800
decide that

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,079
so here you can like story dot content

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,679
component should tell me like

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,320
which content type i'm using at the

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,359
moment so if i go here to the publish

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,240
json

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,680
and on the bottom we should see a page

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,440
so this is the page so

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:11,440
the story uh so if i close now

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,680
um this body then i have the story

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,760
content component as exactly story

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,560
content component the returns the page

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,200
and i'm rendering this uh page where are

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,720
you

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,440
here this page then what i'm doing here

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,480
in the script uh part of the story blog

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,119
is that

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,599
i'm going to prepare my content so kind

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:35,599
of like fake data just empty story

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,599
and then i'm going to load the data

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,359
so i'm going to load the data to using

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,599
the asynchronous

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,960
asynchronous function at the moment and

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,440
here you can see that

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,240
i'm already having something installed

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,400
on my

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,280
storyblock uh using the storyblock next

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,480
module and

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,800
on the app i have a story story api so i

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,800
now can ask using the story api for a

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,119
different content from the storyblock

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,079
so here i am saying like hey please get

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,280
me uh

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,320
the the home story of my api

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,680
sorry of my content so what is this

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,520
whole so this home

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,359
is basically if i go back to the story

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,240
block is it from this content you can

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,040
see that this

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,920
is named uh a story called home with a

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,320
slug home

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,680
so i'm requesting this home this is

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,480
something that i do at the moment

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,040
aesthetically

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,040
i'm asking for a draft version and i

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,560
will get back to the rest of relation

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,240
and second

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,839
of course this is something you wouldn't

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,440
do in the real project

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,119
in a real project you would like find

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,040
out through the that

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,240
what is the false lag or the slack that

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,280
you want to request

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,000
using uh the context of the star of the

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,079
part

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,040
so from the context you can get a part

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,599
of your current

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,079
uh website and using that part you know

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,240
like

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,839
okay i want to get maybe a article

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,200
number one from the blog

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,800
folder of course uh you also like

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,720
sometimes want to have a draft version

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,200
and sometimes a production version

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,880
so they're simple to decide like depends

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,000
on the architecture you choose and how

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,760
you build your project

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,079
but the simplest way is basically to

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,800
decide uh from the context if you are

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,760
like in the dev mode in the next or not

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,240
so here you can see like i am in the in

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,000
the

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,880
dev mode i am asking for draft version

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,920
and if not the name asking for published

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,119
uh right so here i am just always asking

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,119
for draft dimension and always

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,520
statically for the home

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,480
uh great so if i now save it and open

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,680
the home

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,200
then i see a live prayer i see my pro

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,760
i see my content i and it's uh

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,960
showing exactly what i have here but we

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,880
can do it better

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,880
because we have a modern modern

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,880
framework and we would like to have to

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,400
redeploy basically rebuild my website

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,680
all the time i want to see a preview of

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,800
the new content

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,599
so and to prevent this we have also a

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,079
event using the story block next we

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,839
brought also the storyblock breach

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,359
and this storyblock bridge we can create

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,320
uh basically an instance of the

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,839
storyblock breach and

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,480
is this correctly wrote hopefully yes

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,920
so where i am going to listen for input

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,440
event and publish event

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,839
uh and change events so if i save this

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,240
and wait if everything is recompiled in

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,280
a second

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,920
yeah it should work and reload this then

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,880
you see

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,640
all i already outlined here so as i'm

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,760
like moving my arrow uh

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,720
your mouse you see outline and now the

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,720
story block

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,480
is even able to identify which

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,760
components represent on your website

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,800
because this is your website on

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,280
localhost

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,800
uh in the content editor and even if i'm

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,800
using the content or you can see the

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,400
outline of those features so you're

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,720
going to features then you see that i

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,119
have

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,800
even all like highlighting the features

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,240
and not only that if i click on the

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,880
hello js model here

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,760
then i am also opening the hello.js

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,800
monthly here

00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,079
and i can start editing like uh

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,920
isn't this cool so i can

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,200
basically do a real-time editing without

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,520
hitting the save button here

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,240
i'll publish so not i'm not re-deploying

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,079
anything

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,800
i just have the real-time editing

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,079
experience i can do go here i can like

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,800
drag and drop the stuff

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,839
i can select the stuff uh and copy paste

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,720
the stuff

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,839
i can go here and copy paste like the

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,599
whole content

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:26,960
uh and uh sorry copy paste

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,960
add it here and then

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,520
additionally to that we have the latest

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,280
features we did is that if i now go

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,520
and click here on the for example on

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,240
this uh component here and uh move

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,520
backwards

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,280
and i have also this context editing uh

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,520
basically where i can like

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,320
choose what i want to do or maybe like i

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,440
want that

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,920
block after and then i just add a grit a

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,560
new

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,599
empty brush is added then i can like

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,599
accelerate the little

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,720
experience with my content and this

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,480
experience is

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,760
something which all the content editor

00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,240
is looking for because it's something

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,119
that

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,320
you are almost uh into the page builder

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,400
but this is not a page builder

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,440
like this all the developers have all

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,200
the features they need

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,880
but the contenders are and the marketers

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,599
are happy that they can experiment and

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,079
you with the

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,599
existing components and build the new

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,960
website very quickly they can like

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,280
preview them

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,560
and then if they are happy with it they

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,800
just hit the save

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,319
and after that the component is safe and

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,079
then if the publish the web hook is

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,640
triggered and everything is deployed and

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,880
of course

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,319
if as you see that this doesn't work

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,720
great on the mobile

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,400
then probably i should go a version back

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,040
so let's restore the original version

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,400
which was

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:39,359
much nicer so great but still

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,240
i didn't create anything fancy i just

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,520
show you the

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:46,640
basic getting started i loaded something

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,200
and i render it i send it to the blog

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,880
and now the question is like how uh

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,240
there are two questions like how

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,119
works this bridge so the bridge works uh

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,640
using the um only in the drive mode

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,160
because we are adding into the drive

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,560
json a special

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,520
a property and then of course what you

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,599
need to do in the

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,599
page and some of you may already notice

00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,440
that is that we are adding this special

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,079
storybook vadi table

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,480
blog where we can uh thanks to this we

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,200
can identify the components into your

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,800
website

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,240
and this is something which already of

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,119
course you will strip away from the

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,640
production so

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,720
the production will be still so

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,319
performant as always

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,240
all right let's create something let's

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,560
create something new let's create

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,720
a new component from a scratch because

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,839
we have still a little bit time and we

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,079
should create something like let's

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,640
create the article and what is the the

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,520
power of the headless cms in in general

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,440
also

00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,280
because the power of the headless gm cms

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,240
is also that that you can create

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,000
and set up your your content without

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,480
needing to build anything in the front

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,720
end

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,319
so here for example i would normally

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,880
create this from scratch but as

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,880
i wasn't able to create a new space uh

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,400
here i have an article and this article

00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,040
at the moment

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,640
i already added there a hero image title

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,599
intro outer and pros

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,319
so the hero image is a asset of course

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,280
of type

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,200
image and no special rules that i have

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,880
here a title which is a simple text and

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,079
we'll be using for title of the article

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,040
then i have an intro

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,119
where i will write my my intro text or

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,160
maybe a text that will be shown some

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,640
in some teasers uh then i have an author

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,040
where

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,720
i have multiple options how to choose

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,200
out or i can reference them from

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,880
existing fields or external sources but

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,440
now i choose this single option

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,160
or drop down and define my autos

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,480
directly here as a source

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,720
but and the last is of course i have a

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,680
pros which i choose a rich text editor

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,920
and

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,040
i could like customize the toolbar but

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,119
i'm not going to do that

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,079
because we will anyway not use it so

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,240
this is what i created

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,720
an article like definition of an article

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,760
which is a content type

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,599
but i don't still have anything built in

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,760
the neck just i don't have a

00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,079
template in the naked js or like a

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,560
component called article

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,359
and so if you keep it in my normally i

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,200
would block

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,880
i couldn't like really create a new

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,040
stuff but here uh

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,560
i can just say to my content is like hey

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,319
let's create a new folder for you so i

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,880
just created a new folder

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,240
called articles and you can start

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,720
editing the articles

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,839
because if i'm just going to create a

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,720
new article

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:25,359
so let's add a new article like article

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,520
number four probably

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,079
you can save it and a new article is

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,560
added but there is like no page to pro

00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,319
and for this reason exactly you can use

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,359
the form view so and now

00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:39,680
i would be able to like upload my uh

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,119
like like let's choose some image i have

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,440
like here number one

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:48,560
then i could like a cool

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,760
cool title and let's add some

00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,760
uh text something like uh

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,520
building uh your vue.js applications of

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,200
something from the nakja's website

00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,119
and i will be the author and normally

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,720
then i could also write here the pros

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,560
of course you could like build it also

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,400
from the different components but let's

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,880
imagine the simple solutions for the

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,400
article

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,920
as this now save it and i could publish

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,760
and i did basically the same for the

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,599
other article so i hear the article

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,480
number four where i have some pictures

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,040
with some text then i have here also the

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,839
second

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,480
with some text etc so okay i created the

00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,560
articles and now

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,680
i can already use those articles still

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,839
without any

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,960
front-end because i can go now to the

00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,280
whole page

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,560
and i could like love to feature those

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,160
articles down here

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,400
so how to feature them as they are

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,280
already featured here but let's imagine

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,040
i don't

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,079
didn't create this a feat special

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,079
feature here so how to create it is

00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,240
is basically i would go to component and

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,280
i would create a featured articles

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,560
uh component and this featured articles

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,440
component

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,240
uh would have a defined title so here

00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,720
you can see like

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,319
in the title you can like require the

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,520
title for example

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:05,040
but let's don't do that for now and then

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:08,160
we have option to reference

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,880
stories directly from storyblock

00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,920
uh where i said like okay i want to hand

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,839
pick a multiple articles that would be

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,079
featured on the homepage or in this

00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,839
component

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,520
and i want to choose only the articles

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,520
or restricts only to choose

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,680
articles so it will be choose from

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,880
article folder and it will be stories

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,760
existing already in this space so great

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,880
i can do that now if i go to content and

00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,599
open the home

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,880
i can already add i cannot add my

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,760
featured articles because

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,440
i of course didn't allow that so now i

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,280
need to go to the body

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,680
of the of the page of the content type

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,880
page i'm going to open and change the

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,960
schema of the body

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,480
because in the body i write labeled

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,119
author available

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,200
white listed only the grid and teaser so

00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,680
now i'm going to allow also to add a

00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,079
featured articles i'm going to save it

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,040
and now i can see that i can add a

00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,640
featured article

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,480
also into my page or it's better to say

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,760
into my content because it doesn't

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,240
matter you couldn't

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,160
you could also use it to generate not

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,520
only a page but also like an application

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,520
or mobile app so now here i would

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,280
write like probably like featured

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,760
articles

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,560
uh as would be the title on uh the

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,920
website

00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,079
and now i just going to choose some of

00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,319
the articles let's choose this three

00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,920
so now i could like save it and i could

00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,520
even like publish it but still i don't

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,119
see any preview because i didn't create

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,359
it still and in front and for it

00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,520
and if i go to the publish json then i

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,040
see that here is like added new content

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,640
so here is the featured articles

00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,359
component

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,160
with uh ids of my articles and with the

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,200
title that

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,760
i just wrote great so this works so

00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,960
let's

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,440
fix the stuff on the store in the next

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,880
so in the next as you guys can guess i

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,960
already prepared

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,319
so i just closed these steps that it's

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,119
not confusing

00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,720
i already created a featured articles

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,880
component

00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,079
and featured rtx components do the same

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,160
thing as always so

00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,520
expect to get some content through the

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,400
blog property

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,880
or prop and then renders a little bit

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,960
more

00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,359
html with little bit uh tailoring

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,359
styling where it renders a title

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:27,839
right uh added some uh yellow background

00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:29,280
and then uh it's rendered under the list

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:33,040
of the article

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,160
is a component so as we are sending and

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,960
we are creating from

00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,800
our content type article we are going to

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,599
use it only to render article these

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,119
later

00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,000
and then in this article teaser we're

00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:48,079
just sending the article.content

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
as as uh the content because we are here

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,520
also looping through all of our articles

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,960
so blog.articles

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:57,359
so we are basically looping through

00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,119
sorry through this where we have at the

00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,640
moment only write this and i will tell

00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,200
you how to change it to something

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,119
better than the ids in a second and then

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,319
we just render the content together

00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,200
so now i need to of course register my

00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,599
components

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,119
so let's do that in the component.js in

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,160
plugins

00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,720
and it should be already rebuilt

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,880
and let's look here and you already see

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,960
like previews of our articles

00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,640
and we see picture we see also

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,040
storyblock uh the title

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,920
and everything uh the text and even the

00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,119
outdoors but

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,720
we didn't ask for that content and still

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,400
i didn't show you the content here so

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,359
like you can see also like the pictures

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,760
a little bit like

00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,680
scale down or like cut it and that's

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,119
because like in the article t is a

00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,119
component here

00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,280
we you can see like we did the resizing

00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,440
of the image so we even use the story

00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,920
block image service to resize the image

00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,160
to 320 250

00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,079
and then we use it here to the image and

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,400
of course we render the title

00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,960
intro and the outer and that was it it's

00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,680
like nothing more complicated

00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,680
and now i can do all the real-time

00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,520
editing so i can like show only selected

00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,200
lamp i can start re-ordering them

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,200
and you can see that this lady for

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,079
example on the bicycle

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,200
will now move on the last place so i can

00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,680
like rail the ring

00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,240
i can like unselect and select the first

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,160
one

00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,920
that the third one or like i can select

00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,319
this fourth article but that doesn't

00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,400
work so let's do this

00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:26,160
and how does it work that uh the my ui

00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,480
this is instead of sending the uids or

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,680
showing i am getting the real content

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,920
that's something i did in the

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,160
index page and the index page which you

00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,640
could see this res overlay the resource

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,640
relations attribute and this result

00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,079
sorry

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,760
this resolvation actually would

00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,240
basically just say uh

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,160
to storyblock and if you are like have a

00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,040
component called featured articles and

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,720
there is a

00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,200
field called articles please don't send

00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:00,079
me in the real time

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,119
in the real world uh the ui is send me

00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,800
the content

00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,640
so here we just said that to the story

00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,119
block uh instant so like

00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,880
that updates live updating and also i

00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,680
did that here in the

00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,240
asynchronous data request so the same

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,319
thing

00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,760
and then i get a real content and the

00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:18,240
power of this is that

00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,880
now i have a featured artist's component

00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:24,079
and but i can very simply copy it

00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,720
add it here for example change the title

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,599
to

00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,000
sam's article uh then uh remote the

00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,480
first

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,319
uh storyblock is cool so that's if i'm

00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,880
correct it's this one

00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:37,040
and choose this and now i see basically

00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,240
use i use the same component

00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:43,040
and and i see only the same articles

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,559
so i can reuse it very quickly i can

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,280
experiment i can save

00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,079
publish preview and do that stuff uh all

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,079
over again

00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,839
and i'm not blocking like the containers

00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,720
are not blocked marketers can uh

00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,440
play with that and also the users are

00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,400
the content

00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,319
sorry the developers are happy i write

00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,839
so and that was it that was the demo

00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,000
and now i have like three more slides

00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,319
and we are done

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,079
so uh if you want to finish it and build

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:11,280
even like better website uh

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:14,480
like with uh proper navigation menu

00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:17,520
uh featured like headline

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,200
hero area uh with some footer etc

00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,920
and the multi language just go to the

00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,160

sort of links later

00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,920
then of course uh uh the good questions

00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,920
are like where to start in general with

00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,960

getting started to how to create a multi

00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,079
language with a hardware module

00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:00,079
even like uh from the basic topics to

00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,160
videos how to build the e-commerce

the same thing uh we have also for other

00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,119
technologies like nexus and gatsby

00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,720
and for uh or even other technologies we

00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,760
don't have like so

00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,599
powerful uh powerful uh

00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,520
technology apps but we still have a lot

00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,240
of tutorials so just go there and double

storyblock.com technologies and the last

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,839
slide i have is that i am usually like

tea to people behind the story block who

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,559
are building

00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,319
this on daily basis also all the whole

00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,319
team of duck just because because

00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:56,319
because we thought these people it

00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,440
wasn't be able to build such cool stuff

00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,240
that we have today

00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,800

[Music]

00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:28,479

nice talk

00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:47,599
we've seen um we've seen

00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,960
um you know video product even at the

00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,480
city js

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,880
so it's not the first time and i'm just

00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,960
posting it on on the channel if there

00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,720
are any questions

00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,119
and is it like one of the questions i

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,440
have

00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,640
is uh while we're waiting is there any

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,920
way you can

00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,680
connect the features like i think in

00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,910
next there was that feature that you

00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,400
could create um

00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:16,160
[Music]

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,880
you could create like some mtp files and

00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,920
you could

00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,880
use them as an internal way of of

00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,559
internal data and to remember that the

00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,760
name of the feature then

00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,720
you mister next content yeah is it

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,319
possible to

00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:35,839
link the content of next

00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:37,359
with storyblock at all yeah

00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,599
in general like you can use it together

00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,839
to with the next content so if it's

00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,720
like well like like for the development

00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,880
you can very quickly

00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,280
start with next content and then like

00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,920
move the content to the story block uh

00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,400
if you want to so in general like you

00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,400
can

00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,160
use like a storyblock together with all

00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,680
other headless cmss in one project there

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,040
are techniques so that would be quite

00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,280
interesting

00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,799
but yes you can do that you can you can

00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,640
do it yeah yeah

00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:07,599
and um so i mean

00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,480
the service that you you have created it

00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,440
can be used with

00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,079
other technologies other than um max

00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,839
right

00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,680
yes can you mention some others that you

00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:18,720
can use yes of course uh

00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,160
i mean like uh all the the big names

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,319
frameworks it's possible so

00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,359
even the the live or real-time editing

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,200
it's negligence

00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:30,400
gatsby simp like vanilla javascript even

00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:34,400
uh svelte but also like the

00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:37,200
uh the the things like python php

00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,319
so we have even the mobileness of kotlin

00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,760
and we have

00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,599
usually like a lot you will find a lot

00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,680
of samples uh also for

00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,880
uh all those technologies like icebeat

00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,119
asp.net

00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,400
so you can find it there how to use our

00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,400
api with it so

00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,319
every technology that can accept the

00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,359
rest api or the graphql

00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:58,480
is compatible basically okay

00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:02,319
and then i mean if you would want to use

00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:05,359
this as um as an

00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:08,240
like to sell some products or to

00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:09,280
to make it like a a website where you

00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:13,599
could um

00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:17,280
make it a bit more like a market place

00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:19,200
so e-commerce website yeah yeah and

00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,119
is it is there a capability for that

00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,720
yeah i mean like we are not uh

00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,880
we don't have an e-commerce solution

00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,760
directly so we are

00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,760
because we we had one and there like in

00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,559
the future maybe it will be resurrected

00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,400
i would say

00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,240
but there uh there is like you have to

00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,680
focus on something and we are focusing

00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,400
on storytelling and the

00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,119
whole experience of the of this tms and

00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,440
the commerce

00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,480
uh solutions commerce uh like commerce

00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,119
tools shopify

00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,480
big commerce and software which we are

00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,119
like all supporting already

00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,720
right now by plugins are focusing on the

00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,359
selling and creating and managing your

00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,960
products

00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,720
they are not focusing on the content

00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,839
management system really like i mean

00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,000
like the the managing

00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,119
the storytelling and all that stuff

00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,440
around that

00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,200
so we are working together so on the

00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,480
headless project you just choose

00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:08,400
like the your commerce solution you like

00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,599
you take the story block and you

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,440
together you can like

00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,200
link it together and then work and build

00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,880
the website as you need

00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,720
and you get like the best experience

00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,520
from both of the worlds instead of

00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,559
having like

00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,720
super great uh experience of

00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:24,880
like managing your products but like

00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:28,480
little bit creepy or not so

00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,200
well done uh way to managing your

00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,640
content

00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:35,359
like non-commercial content what about

00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,119
theming because that's probably there's

00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,240
some professional companies that would

00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,599
like to use

00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:44,160
you mean teaming of storyblock app yes

00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,520
no i mean you're creating a like a

00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,240
website

00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,960
you wanna have different kind of things

00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,240
so

00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:55,440
you know this is uh yeah

00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,480
i mean if i may uh it's uh fully up to

00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,400
you because it's uh

00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,720
you you can use i mean the good sample

00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,960
is always saying uh the getting started

00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,799
because we have one space or one project

00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,599
for getting started where it's the same

00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,160
content

00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,119
and we are using that content into the

00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,400
also gets b

00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,720
also on packages and also next js tutor

00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,640
uh

00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,040
getting started repository which is also

00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,480
on the on the github

00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,480
and this is the like teaming so you

00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,280
theoretically can use your content

00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,040
on different uh inference different

00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,160
endpoints with different technologies

00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:30,079
with different uh

00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:31,119
look and feel okay and what part of the

00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,400
application is

00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:36,559
open source uh the the

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,960
ecosystem around so like storyblock uh

00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,880
next module is open source the renderers

00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,640
for all the fields you can create like

00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,240
like some of the plugins so because

00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,680
you can create your custom plugins and

00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,680
fields but this uh

00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,799
the the core application is of course

00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,119
not open source

00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:53,119
it's a software as a service so it

00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,040
wouldn't make a sense and to be honest

00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,880
if it would be also like open source it

00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,520
will be like really hard to do

00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,240
like that yeah uh features delivering

00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,480
and everything

00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,359
but it's nice to see companies that they

00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,680
are a

00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:07,599
software as a service but still the

00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,400
contributing to the open source uh

00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,520
community

00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,319
that's that's really great and any

00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,960
any features that you think you would be

00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:18,240
able to

00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,880
hint and tell people something that's

00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,920
coming uh yeah i mean like it's uh

00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,480
what's coming is uh

00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,480
definitely the redesign so all we saw

00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,040
it's uh will be changed soon we have

00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,160
also

00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:33,040
already have the first uh first screens

00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,000
and also like working internally to look

00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,640
pretty cool because

00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,760
the proper design team put a lot of ux

00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,599
thinking about that

00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,520
of course it will be like uh not a

00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,359
revolution it will be an evolution

00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,839
so that all the all features will be

00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:47,119
there which is really the version two of

00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,200
the api officially

00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,720
so it's much more powerful and you can

00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,480
still use there are like some new

00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,440
capabilities

00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,720
like the this resolving of the relations

00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,480
but i show you

00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,240
uh you can all you there was a

00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,160
limitation to do only one level

01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,280
now you can do if i'm if i'm correct

01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,760
like two or even

01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,760
two three lovers so so something that

01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,599
usually people are asking for graphql

01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,440
but maybe you don't need aircraft kill

01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,760
if the rest api is so powerful that you

01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,280
don't

01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,960
don't need to craft cure you know like

01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,040
if you are building the website doesn't

01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:20,559
always make a sense

01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:22,880
and uh yeah dedication

01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,920
uh is there an authentication module

01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:28,000
that

01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:30,720
you you can use through storyblock uh

01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,440
one more time the what module

01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,520
authentication yes uh we have also

01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,680
authentication module

01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,520
and this is built because uh you can

01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,720
create and build the cast of apps for

01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,119
storybox so

01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,640
on the left left side as you could see i

01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,160
clicking through the sections you can

01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,720
install a special app like google

01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:52,480
analytics for example or

01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:53,119
or a versa uh in integration that will

01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,359
show you

01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,599
uh what uh if you if the deployment on

01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:59,920
the versa netlify was uh

01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,960
done correctly or if there was an error

01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,200
and all the

01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,720
like build your own app which looks like

01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,960
like a storyblock part

01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:09,200
you will have there out you will have to

01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,599
authenticate with the storyblock api

01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,280
and inside that context in that iframe

01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,880
you can do anything you want because we

01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,000
give you the management api

01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,720
or cli and with that you just build

01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
whatever

01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:26,319
you want with the technology you want to

01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,520
so the is to be a bit more precise

01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:30,000
you still need to upload your

01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:33,040
application in little file let's say

01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,280
or personally but

01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:37,599
the sort of management of the data is

01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,640
done through

01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:43,280
urine service right um

01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,079
not only i mean like uh the good sample

01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,079
i am saying uh

01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,920
showing like like the ver the versailles

01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,839
metlife deployment or the list

01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,960
of the deploys is a good simple to show

01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:53,280
like uh

01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,160
to your users if you don't want them to

01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,640
have uh like

01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,559
have to leave always uh the story block

01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,680
to go to netlify to see if the website

01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,480
was deployed

01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,280
yeah so they can see directly in the

01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,720
story block

01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:09,359
and also in this case uh

01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,960
uh in this case uh maybe there's they

01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:12,480
don't see also all the other

01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,720
unnecessary information they see only

01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,480
the information that developer

01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,240
choose basically to show them in the

01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:21,280
storyblock uh app

01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,400
the other option is also the content you

01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,640
can have a different works

01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,520
workstages and let's imagine that you

01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,760
could see like

01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,799
uh some people are using like love the

01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,319
trail of course

01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:32,319
so you can build like trailer boards

01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:34,640
where you can see all of your stories

01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,359
or content and you see in what what

01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,039
stages

01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:39,119
uh is that content and then you can just

01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,400
drag and drop it from a stage like

01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,480
drafting to the published

01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,319
published and instead of going to the

01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,359
story and click the publish button

01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:48,240
it will be published because yeah that's

01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:50,960
really good

01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,680
that's very nice feature now that that's

01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,599
really good

01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,880
and let me see if we have any other

01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:56,880
questions and

01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,480
we don't have any more but i am pretty

01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,119
sure that um

01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,039
during the the day because a lot of

01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,039
these dreams that we are doing and

01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:08,640
it's happening during lunch time maybe

01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:12,880
people are busy

01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:17,280
but they are able to recap on twitter on

01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:20,160
youtube and post any questions so

01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,280
for example this is streamed already on

01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,640
twitter

01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,920
so if anybody has wants to have watched

01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,640
this

01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,039
stream later on and they want to ask a

01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:34,640
question they can tag you

01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:37,440
what's up and again is my name

01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,559
so as you see samuel snopko uh just

01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,280
right that is my

01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,880
type tech or just take a story block so

01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,640
storyblock

01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,240
yeah and they can ask you any questions

01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,160
at any time and you

01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,599
you can play back with them with an

01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,960
answer because

01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,039
a lot of the stuff that we are doing

01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,200
right now we are just

01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,400
recording them and putting them all on

01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,359
pusher

01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,680
and a video library so there's like a

01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:04,640
massive library with a lot of videos

01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,559
and people can go back and let you know

01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,880
later on and watch the videos on their

01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,920
uh

01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,839
when they have time and it's an amazing

01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,280
solution and i think it's going to work

01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:15,200
quite well

01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,119
so yeah i think i don't think there's

01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,520
any other questions

01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,440
thanks again it was a pleasure to have

01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,440
you on our meet up

01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,599
probably we'll see you on the next

01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,400
conference and a

01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:30,240
yeah it was again a big pleasure of mine

01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,400
yeah that would be very nice yeah

01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,359
and sorry for a little bit of struggles

01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,839
on beginning that was

01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:36,400
unexpected but i think i i managed

01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,480
that's quite

01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:43,680
well and it's i do sometimes talks and

01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:46,799
i i do i do do

01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:48,559
like some like coding but when you are

01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:50,640
in there you are very focused on the

01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:54,400
thing and you don't realize

01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,880
extension for uh smaller problems

01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,760
and you just it's just the beauty of

01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,039
finding them

01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:04,319
and even the audience helping you

01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,280
to find the issues it's quite an amazing

01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:08,319
thing

01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,640
and yeah so it was it was great to see

01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,160

01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,960
the order of um of the things that you

01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,680
were publishing you were able to see

01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,440
