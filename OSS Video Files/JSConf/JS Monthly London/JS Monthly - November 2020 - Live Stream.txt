18:35 - What the heck(ma) is ECMA? // Abby Mitchell
Have you ever felt confused by terms like ES5, ES6, ES2015? What is the difference? Is it all still Javascript? Why isn't it JS2015???

These are all great questions that will be answered during this talk. We'll cover a bit about the history of Javascript standards, where you can find the most up to date information, and the key syntactic differences between the most common versions.

18:50 - Break

19:00 - Introduction to Computer Vision(open CV) in JS // Italo Jose Goncalves De Oliveira
Do you wanna know computer vision but don't know Python? Are you in a project that needs to be coded in a fast way and can't use a custom deep learning model?

In this talk, we will see how the classical computer vision works and how a computer vision engineer can solve many problems in a fast and easy way than deep leaning. Everything in Javascript!
