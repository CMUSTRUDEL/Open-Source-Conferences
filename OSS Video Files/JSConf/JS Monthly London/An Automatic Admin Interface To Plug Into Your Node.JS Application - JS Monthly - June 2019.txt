hello everyone my name is Wojtek and

00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,519
politicals of the brothers okay but I'm

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,250
going to tell you about the thing which

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,960
is an admin bra this is an

00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,260
administrative automatic admin interface

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,869
which can attack into an node.js

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,240
application okay and I have three goals

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,090
of my presentation the first goal is to

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,130
show how it works you know so we will

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,929
have a live coding session on which I

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,059
will show you how to build an admin

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,640
panel in five maybe ten minutes okay

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,860
the second thing is I would like to

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,320
encourage you to use that this is an

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,870
open source free tool to build an animal

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,309
panels so I believe that the more people

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,739
are using it the more people are

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,050
participating in this that product would

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,210
be better and empower people will will

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,129
use that and the third thing is that I

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,559
would like to share with you the two

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,289
ideas about because you know this is a

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,960
huge project we had lots of challenges

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,350
along the way so I would like to show to

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,799
design choices implementation phases

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:11,939
which we had so maybe you will be able

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,520
to reuse that in your projects I divided

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,970
this presentation to four parts three

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,549
and the questions so first the

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,530
background then life coding and design

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,850
choices as I mentioned so let's start

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,939
with an onion bra briefly an admin bra

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:34,200
is the admin panel which looks like this

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:37,229
usually as I mentioned it can be tucked

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,920
in to the node.js application and build

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,329
you build such like that

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,579
why you build that you know because you

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,070
know there is a there are a lot of open

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:52,259
source things available on the web

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:55,979
which are we don't any news we are I

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,320
basically I work for the IT companies

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,090
for the 10 years and we started using

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,310
Ruby on Rails this is the first

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,049
technology like ten years ago

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,869
do you know what the ribbon race is

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:10,879
because it's like old technology have

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:13,050
someone use that yeah use that okay like

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,629
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,970
people in the room so it was all you

00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:21,010
know the long time ago but what was

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,590
awesome about Rubio race it was that

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:27,640
Ruben always was the major framework out

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:33,340
there in Ruby language and it had to

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:35,290
half base fee to admin panels one was

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,720
the race I mean and the second was the

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,940
active admin those panels were basically

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,250
libraries which can be tracked with line

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,019
one line of code you could just have the

00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,950
entire admin panel have used some of

00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:50,049
them in your applications okay so the

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,599
three people who used Ruby didn't use

00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:53,739
that make sense

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,819
along the way we migrated to different

00:02:53,739 --> 00:03:01,060
technologies and we migrated to Django

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:06,069
for instance python and also called DJ

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:09,160
Ango junk also has its admin you know we

00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:12,130
just DJ Ango admin we all reduce that

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,840
but like after year ago we decided to

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:18,220
switch you know because we are so it but

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,040
company which likes challenges you know

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,410
and we decided to switch to JavaScript

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,260
and there is no such thing as an amine

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:29,290
panel you know for frameworks out there

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,150
there are things like keystone for

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:36,700
instance which is basically a CMS and

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:38,500
there is an extra admin but da but it

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,780
connects straight to the database you

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,150
know without you know any reusing any

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,299
business logic what you already have in

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:50,350
your application so we built the ogden

00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:55,150
and in the next couple of minutes i will

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:59,650
show you how to use that okay so let's

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:03,099
open the visual studio code and don't

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:07,450
look at this okay right now let's focus

00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:09,370
on the story okay so let's be the story

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,099
okay because this is the this sauce

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:16,209
actual business problems okay so the

00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:18,700
story is you have a client who works who

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:22,030
lives in Dubai for instance and this

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:25,539
client has an it he has to build an

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,380
application which is a library okay this

00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:29,800
is an MVP

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,340
it has just three models books users and

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,430
orders

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,010
so basically users can perform an orders

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:40,720
to order a book sit down complicated MVP

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:45,430
in Dubai and he would like to launch it

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,670
so you build the API in happy J's

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,490
framework have used happy GS okay this

00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,290
is no js' dono have you of use Express

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,200
yes

00:04:52,290 --> 00:05:01,180
okay my example is in happy jest so I

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:05,530
think I made a wrong decision sorry for

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,540
that so baby happy J's this is basically

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:14,880
the same as Express okay and let's stay

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:19,150
with that sorry for the simplicity okay

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,000
so we have the happy GS back and

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:28,690
graduated okay this is uh this is this

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,510
back end so we have happy framework on

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:34,000
the top we have connection to the

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,200
database we use Mongoose Mongoose is the

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,810
library which allows you to not

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,330
connected to the manga okay so we are

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,420
launching the server under the port 3000

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:46,510
and we are serving three routes one is

00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:49,530
the iconic Hollywood epic hello world

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:52,060
the second is the fetching all the users

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,410
books it won't have to remember that

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,440
because we won't use that but this is

00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:59,470
like working application and the last

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,390
thing is that we launch the server okay

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,540
so let's see how it works right now I

00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:10,950
will use no daman okay I'm sorry can you

00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:10,950
see the zoom around no no

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:19,050
okay no demon is a thing which launched

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,090
the application and allows to reload the

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,479
application when ever you make a change

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:27,030
so we launched it let's open the page

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,770
this is the first page and it should

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,910
work okay it works so this is the

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,300
application which we built for our

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:37,590
client okay from Dubai and this client

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:40,319
from the by have another need he would

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:43,169
like to build an enemy panel for this

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,699
application so he has the users he has

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,280
the books you know which we basically

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,560
manually added to the database and now

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,050
he would like to manage this ok so the

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,470
standard approach to this would be it

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:58,259
was the first approach go to Tim Ferriss

00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,690
probably by some admin panel interface

00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,789
like then implement this interface in

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,919
some kind of front-end framework angular

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,620
whatever and then beat the backend for

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,659
that so for me it's like two three weeks

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,550
of work you know with automated tests

00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:15,360
and so on another approach would be to

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,220
used DJ Ango admin for instance launched

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,530
it on another server connect with the

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,210
database but we have the problem we

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,070
cannot reuse the business logic which we

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,729
you know complicated business logic

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:29,699
which we did or the tooth solution right

00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:34,500
now is we can use the admin block okay

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:36,150
so in which what I will do I will do but

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,889
before I will do this I will just

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,530
explain that we will do this in two

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,199
steps the first step is that because I

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:46,169
mean bro doesn't leave us an external

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,150
product external process at least if I

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,610
inside your application it reuse the

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:54,180
routes you have in that you know so we

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:58,080
have to first add it to happy GS which

00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:02,430
is the same as expertise and let's do

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,969
this ok ok so let's go to the happy J

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:10,530
yes happy J s page

00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:12,180
ok ok it's loading that's why you like

00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:16,889
extras more because happy Jase is

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,620
loading ok there's a plug-in section and

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:22,020
when you find the admin there is an

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,070
amiable plug-in perfect and go there

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:29,060
then I swipe to the

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:31,640
meditation okay and this is the

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,080
commentation how to AB this okay

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:39,620
so first of all we have to require that

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:43,039
Oh perfect it's not complicated copy

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:46,670
paste the code so I required that then I

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:50,720
have to perform this particular setup so

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:53,270
in Express your code to compress into

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,420
Express the framework you use middle

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:59,150
worse so here you have plugins this is

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,290
the difference so let's copy here and it

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:06,310
paste it there copy paste and pay me

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:10,190
okay how the software is built right now

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:12,230
so okay so we we have severed register

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,930
which add the plug-in we passed this

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,970
plug-in to the configuration and we pass

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,180
some options okay let's remove that for

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,300
now and just use the default options I

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:26,120
saved it let's see okay we don't have

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:31,250
any errors in the terminal that's good

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,630
so let's refresh the page nothing

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,210
happened of course nothing happened

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:39,430
because we have to add the admin you're

00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:44,240
okay because this is the default path

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:46,010
okay and we have the admin panel right

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,530
here okay so this is the entire

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:54,290
interface it's everything clear

00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:56,840
perfect okay so we have amazing admin

00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,760
panel build on react GS on the front end

00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,830
on happy J's in the backend right now

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,100
because but we can use Express for

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,200
instance but it has this one button

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,610
check out the documentation so which is

00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,800
not useful for our client from Dubai so

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,780
let's add something to this panel okay

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,330
as I mentioned you have to add this

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,800
panel to the framework this is the first

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,470
step the second step you have to fetch

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,710
the data from your database will use

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:29,030
 as an example okay so the second

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,540
step will be to as we call that adapters

00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,850
okay

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,850
so we'll add a mongoose adapter

00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:41,379
we just got onion Drummond goes make

00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:43,269
sense and we have to register this

00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:51,360
adapter in order to do that I have to

00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:51,360
add an admin bra this is the boring part

00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:05,560
okay fingers crossed that it will work

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:11,430
okay we are registering the adapter why

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:19,060
we do this because we have to we have to

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:21,120
teach admin bra to see the resources

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,379
within this particular database

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,980
otherwise it won't be able to recognize

00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:26,470
them

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,410
okay so let's add options right there

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,860
well here as I mentioned you know I

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:35,019
don't know if I mentioned that but you

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,029
could add multiple data sources so you

00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:40,480
could have basically different databases

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:43,509
so imagine the portal in which you have

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:51,480
three databases no three databases I

00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:51,480
have only two hands and yeah sorry

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:57,850
you put passed on I hear all those three

00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,500
databases okay so we are in case of

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,129
Mongoose we are passing whatever

00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:08,350
Mongoose is returning so and this is a

00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:14,009
connections object okay and let's pass

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:18,300
it to I don't know I

00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:22,029
okay no errors let's refresh that and

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:24,819
boom it works so as I mentioned we have

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:28,870
three models one it was that book the

00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:30,519
user and the order okay let me show the

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:35,829
definition for the models okay right now

00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:39,009
so I will jump jump into the panel we I

00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:41,649
have one fire models with the model

00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:44,189
definition in Mongoose so we have book

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:47,860
book has a title description and author

00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:48,490
perfect user with email name and we have

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,470
order

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,010
with order ID which is a string user

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,690
which is a reference to the user object

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,730
this is how you definitely find the

00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:00,220
references you have a book which is

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,200
reference to the book no surprises and

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,709
we have a quantity because because I

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:08,320
added a Lambro quantity perfect so let's

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:10,870
see how those models looks in our new

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,760
panel when you open the book okay I

00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:20,860
other some books nice all those things

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:24,070
are here users also this is me my email

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,149
and orders let's create another order

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,220
because this is the most interesting

00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:29,170
part so when you add the order you could

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,459
just use another string whatever string

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,360
you like because we don't have any

00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,360
restrictions here eh

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,470
but here you can you have you could have

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,870
the reference to the already created

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,270
objects you know so I have the reference

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:47,080
to the my email and I have the reference

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:50,380
to the the trio from Kafka any quantity

00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:55,029
50 and I can create those items when I

00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:58,240
go back sorry when my client from Dubai

00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:03,570
goes back to his panel he can filter all

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:07,630
those elements within this admin sort

00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:10,690
see and so on so this is quite cool but

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:14,800
in the end it's in the wrong term it's

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:16,540
used it doesn't have you know lots of

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,100
views no because at the end in your

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,660
applications you would like to change

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,520
something you would like to have we

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,079
would like to add in business logic

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,959
I don't know change the fields and so on

00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:30,990
and Allen plan allows you to do that ok

00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:34,660
so are you from me perfect

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,279
so the next thing the last thing in life

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,230
coding section will be to add some

00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:41,490
options ok I don't want to do this life

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,980
you know I'm a smart guy I prepared

00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:48,540
different steps let's keep all of them

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,540
ok and just use the last one

00:14:51,870 --> 00:15:03,450
okay and I'm copying the options object

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:10,290
okay and I'm I will paste it here so

00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:13,180
here exactly okay okay I don't save it

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:16,630
for now so we have this database array

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:19,329
as we had before we have we changed the

00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,130
blending options okay so when we

00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:24,630
launched it because this is a beta

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:28,600
version so it's not super stable it's in

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:30,220
0.9 and it with super stable like next

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,050
month because we are launching this for

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,880
two clients in production and we are now

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,970
fixing improving things in production

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,350
you know speed and so on and but we

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,180
launched it's the episode the first

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,769
thing was how to change the colors you

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,839
know this was the first thing you know

00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:48,310
what people ask so we added this feature

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,600
you could change the colors names and so

00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:55,230
on then you could you can modify all

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,910
resources this is the most amazing thing

00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:01,690
this is the most amazing thing but this

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:04,120
is pretty cool as well so we could pass

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,310
the model itself not the entire database

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,140
but the model and then along with the

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,390
model passed an option to this

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:13,060
particular model so we are changing the

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,160
book okay we are changing what we are

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,130
doing

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,110
first we are saying that ID field

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,269
shouldn't be visible in the list we

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,130
don't care about that then we define the

00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:26,529
description field for the book should be

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:29,380
rich text not the raw string but rich

00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:32,459
text and we are not adding new amazing

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:36,130
property which is combined name and

00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:39,730
since this is a react thing we are

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:42,550
passing the component which should

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:46,000
override how the particular field would

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:48,910
be rendered on the list okay I will tell

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,399
you about this three more about this let

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,250
me note okay so let's see how it looks

00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:56,980
right now so we have ID we don't have

00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:00,700
any field which is combined name and

00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:04,360
description when you go to the

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:10,390
okay and this is it let's save it let's

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:14,380
see if it works it works okay and we

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:17,459
have this amazing new look well my my

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:21,339
monitor is everything is pink you know

00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:23,260
and you have you don't have sorry you

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:27,100
shouldn't have this or okay because

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:33,610
because we have the older and we change

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:36,640
the book so my mistake okay so in yeah

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:39,880
so in book we don't have done ID we have

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,960
combined name and when we go back go to

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:48,429
the Edit we will see the description

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:51,790
which is rich text editor you know it's

00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:54,669
pretty cool and let's go back to the

00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:58,179
code as you see there is an alien blood

00:17:54,669 --> 00:18:01,120
dot require so you probably noticed that

00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,110
we didn't use any Babel we didn't use

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,820
any bundler

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:09,010
but it works so what we support the the

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:12,970
purpose is that we support all those set

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:15,549
up even if we use happy GS expresses J's

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,380
whatever the very framework without the

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:21,070
setup for server-side rendering and

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,650
react we handle that by using this so

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:26,880
this onion product require behaves as

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,620
regular require but it requires a

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,480
component j6 component and this

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,410
particular j6 component looks like this

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:39,040
and for some of you who don't know what

00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:41,260
just X components are this is the way

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,100
how to define components in react world

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:47,860
so basically you say that there should

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,620
be a component called name which takes

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,600
the props those props are passed by

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,910
default to all complement components in

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,460
list in edit there is a unchanged

00:18:54,910 --> 00:19:00,850
function so we could just add an edit

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:03,669
modify edit component for particular

00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:06,360
property or add new so this is pretty

00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:14,650
cool so what we do with this other title

00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:18,549
by and author so trial by Kafka

00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,120
and this is what it does give me a

00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:23,920
second

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:28,600
let's find 12 from Kafka the trial by

00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:31,780
Kafka sorry and basically this is pretty

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:34,090
it there's a huge documentation about

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,299
what to change how to add things because

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,950
you could just add new functions and

00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:41,290
dashboard as you saw on the on the first

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:44,080
screen now so the possibilities are huge

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,360
and again I would like to you to use

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:54,240
that do you have any questions regarding

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:56,950
this part asked them in the in the end

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,330
because I have two more sorry because I

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,700
have two more things I would like to

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:04,960
tell you ok just too much fix the box

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,940
waiting and we are still live coding

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,580
okay so this is the summary what we did

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,580
we did all those things so we added

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,679
within the used extra tutor sorry we use

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,860
the happy GS

00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:24,309
but expose is available as well we added

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:30,160
the database integration okay let me

00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:33,100
okay the last part of my talk super

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,860
short part is the challenges ok I would

00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,320
like to tell you about two things what

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,390
we did in the onion bra infrastructure

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,100
ok maybe you will be able to reuse that

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,740
ok the first thing is the project setup

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:47,470
since I mean block consists of different

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,299
modules you know so we have the Mongoose

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,610
adapter stick siculus adapter for

00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:53,530
instance happy gos plug-in Express

00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,419
plug-in you have those things and those

00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,669
things are in separate repositories

00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:59,169
because we think that you know in the

00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:00,970
future different people will build

00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:03,790
different adapters and we don't have to

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:06,549
have them you know this is the general

00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,169
idea so this was the first challenge the

00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:09,669
second challenge is purchase all the

00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:12,940
documentation because we have one

00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:15,520
documentation for entire project and how

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,880
to link all together so if you are

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,290
developing application consisting of

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,730
different modules we have to link them

00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:26,620
by using NPN dot - link or a young link

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,940
for instance and we have to have a way

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:33,910
to easy you know

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:34,360
do this what we did we built an onion

00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,650
bro

00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:42,000
deaf repository which consists of three

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:44,710
things one we use get sub modules though

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,110
this is awesome tool and this is

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:51,850
basically a link between repositories so

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:53,730
we say that in this this is the link to

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,990
the admin bra this is linked to that

00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,910
example up because we have the example

00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,860
up in the poster as well do they express

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,659
with the happy Jason to other bunch of

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,940
other things then we have the

00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:06,970
documentation so we generate the

00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,740
documentation based on the code and

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,620
imagine if you store the documentation

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,230
in the original repository all changes

00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,750
in the documentation requires the

00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:19,360
approval from other member of the team

00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,470
and this is what it do so you have to

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,450
store it somewhere else

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,210
so this is the place where we store this

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:28,120
we use the Google page sorry github

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:30,610
pages to host it the last thing is

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,950
infrastructure this is amazing thing so

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,049
inside there is a docker and the couple

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,010
set up basically dokkan dokkan compose

00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:40,299
is used to launch the application so

00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,970
here in the test application we have

00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:46,330
sequel so we have a post class we have

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,679
the mongoose and the idea is if you

00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:51,520
would like to work on that

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,190
don't let the repository those things

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,280
would be fetched as well go there and

00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:59,950
run docker compose up and you are ready

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,400
to go to add new features let's do this

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:07,210
today okay so this is the first

00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,400
challenge and why I'm why this is so

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,580
important in my from my perspective is

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,470
that you could use this this in your

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,870
project I believe that in your project

00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,240
you have the backend and makes plus I

00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,190
know the bucket is the deck space and

00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,929
the front-end in angular for instance so

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,150
you could just add back and hill

00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:27,370
frontage here and new comers to the

00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,100
project could do not dwell Paulo Torre

00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:34,770
launched one command and they're ready

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:38,530
to go Abney features ok clear

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:41,890
perfect the second thing is the

00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,600
documentation ok this is huge so

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,390
when you start working on open source

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,769
software the crucial thing is the

00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,289
commutation because this is the

00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:52,690
connection with developers and there is

00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:55,200
a thing called curse of knowledge you

00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:58,690
know about curse of knowledge

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,210
okay so two people may be killed knows

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:03,820
so basically when you do something the

00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:06,309
curse of knowledge is that when you do

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,260
something it's very very hard to explain

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:10,659
it you know because you've heard the

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,519
people who actually done it so it's hard

00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,470
to explain it and the documentation is

00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,710
the way to explain it so it has to be

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:19,929
solid and we decided at those world

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:22,840
changes so we had to describe how to use

00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:25,059
that in steps the scraps describe the

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,460
entire interface so we allow to the for

00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:32,769
instance use the components we have to

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:35,080
describe that and we have to describe

00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:38,350
this is this and describe the actual

00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:42,519
interfaces of all the classes and we

00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:45,850
have to have one tool to do this and we

00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:50,799
use J's dock you know what the J's

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:53,620
dogies yeah basically this is a markup

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,350
language which can be added again which

00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,779
can be added above the function so using

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,850
the tags you could describe the function

00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:04,450
and generate the documentation based on

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:08,169
that automatically and this is how it

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,899
looks not so beautiful user friendly but

00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:13,029
this is the default team but what J's

00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:15,549
dog has it has the ability to add new

00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:18,970
plugins teams whatever you know it's

00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:21,190
quite easy so what we did we built

00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:24,549
something called better Doc's I will

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,260
paste a link sorry I will show you a

00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:28,990
link and basically the presentation will

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:33,159
be online there which is an open source

00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:35,440
team to the onion blow to the Psalter

00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:40,389
the J's doc which looks like this it's

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:43,899
more user friendly and we also added two

00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:46,600
things no one we added a category

00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:48,639
plug-in so see the project is huge we

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,200
have to group those similar things

00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:52,270
together you know in the sidebar so we

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,039
added that and the second thing is the

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,450
spoiler alert because it's not it's not

00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:59,950
published yet it

00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:01,389
just in my local machine component

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,919
plugin I'll show you how it looks this

00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:06,159
is awesome and it will publish this like

00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,659
next month and we also use something

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,759
called where my graphs

00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:13,779
this is not our tool this is this guy I

00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,899
will show you how it looks okay because

00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:20,309
those things could improve the

00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:23,350
declamation documentation a lot okay so

00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:25,330
let's go to the documentation this is

00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:29,499
the link it was in the work because I

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:33,820
have to okay it should work okay so this

00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:35,759
is documentation and two things three

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,869
things I will show you the first is the

00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,289
compatible component so category

00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:43,899
category plug-in what it does is it

00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:46,509
basically up this so different sections

00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:50,950
in sidebar which is not original in

00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:53,379
JavaScript so this is quite okay but the

00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,629
second thing is better you know so we

00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:58,149
have here a unique component section

00:26:55,629 --> 00:27:00,429
which is not present in all JavaScript

00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:02,350
projects and when you go to the

00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:04,149
component first at the quick because

00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:06,700
those are the components which you could

00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:09,580
you can reuse forbidding the interface

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,830
using that in block let's go to the

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:18,070
value block so we build the plug-in

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:19,899
which is here which takes the prop when

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,789
you build the react this aside story

00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:23,799
when you build the real component if you

00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:25,749
don't know this react suggest to use

00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:28,419
something called prop types this is the

00:27:25,749 --> 00:27:30,159
definition for the input for particular

00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:34,029
component and this is in the code you

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,039
know so what we did is that we build a

00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:38,230
plugin which uses this property with

00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:40,629
this definition and which prints it here

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,460
so you don't have to do a thing if you

00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:44,259
follow the guys from react and you are

00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:47,919
using javascript it should be there you

00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:49,960
know automatically so like that but

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,779
there is one more thing okay

00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,940
we couldn't resist ourselves and we did

00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:58,889
something more we allowed people to you

00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:01,809
know see how the component looks like in

00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:03,840
chess doc so if you are building the

00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:06,999
application react and we would like to

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,740
document it could use that and this is

00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:10,600
the

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:14,679
you don't see the border but this is

00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:16,299
they have borders you see this particle

00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,890
components for this particular example

00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:23,200
you define in JJ's doc what's even best

00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:26,919
and we didn't start on that is that you

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,840
can change that life so before use that

00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:32,020
confusing that component you can verify

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,779
how it looks if it suits your needs or

00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:40,960
how it behaves when you users will feel

00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:43,870
more things as was expected okay so and

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:48,600
this would be all published like next

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,600
month coming back to the presentation

00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:55,799
and this is it okay so those were the

00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,940
challenges the first challenge was the

00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,440
project how to set up project with get

00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:03,370
sub modules the second was the how to

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:06,429
configure dredge dock to use it in such

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:09,250
project I would like to encourage you to

00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:10,350
use gesture because his I amazing tool

00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:16,630
thank you very much

00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:16,630
