hello everybody my name is Joe Frank

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,859
Otte and I am a developer advocate at a

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,580
Blee if you've not heard of a bleep er a

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:15,089
platform which enables developers to

00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:19,199
stream real-time data and as a developer

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,029
advocate my job is to write tutorials to

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,980
make demos to do a lot of public

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,689
speaking to make it easier for people to

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,269
understand how to use the platform I

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,039
have been a web developer for about 10

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,099
years and I've worked in many different

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,829
sectors from startups to big

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,260
organizations from charities to agencies

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,660
a civil service and I even tried to be

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,450
unemployed to be self-employed for a

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,160
while but I'm not very good at charging

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,430
people so that didn't really work as a

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,370
business model I am also a coach an

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,510
organizer at code bar London and what

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,190
I'm trying to get across with all of

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,800
this information is that I spend a lot

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,000
of my time talking to developers and to

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,370
the people who work with them so

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,800
designers product managers from all

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,960
levels of seniority and from many

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,460
different walks of life and through

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,860
talking to these people I've started to

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,320
notice some some trends and these are

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,240
trends in behaviour and in beliefs and

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,270
in complaints amongst people who work in

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,250
the tech industry and so to illustrate

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,350
some of these I'd like to tell you a

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,619
story about a friend of mine let's call

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,509
her mo and while I tell you about mo I

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,090
would like you to see if you recognize

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,100
any of her behaviors in yourself so mo

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,110
is a web developer she's got a few years

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,180
of experience under her belt and she

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,890
works on a team with other developers in

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,290
a medium-sized organization

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,299
she went to uni mostly because her

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,860
teachers told her that she should but

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,170
she feels like maybe she chose the wrong

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,720
course but at the time she was too

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,759
afraid to swap courses Midway so instead

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,700
she graduated as a subject that she

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,320
wasn't really that interested in but

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,299
when she graduated she decided to

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,579
completely rescale she taught herself

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,110
HTML and CSS with a view to becoming a

00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,460
web developer but because she was

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,590
self-taught she's always had this

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,409
niggling worry that her skills as a as a

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,200
developer and not quite at the same

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,340
level as her peers and sometimes she

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,110
worries that she doesn't know the

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,599
correct names or the correct techniques

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,920
for the code that she's using but she

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,050
doesn't want to ask her colleagues

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,599
for help because she's afraid of letting

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,220
on that she doesn't know these things

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,069
she imagines that they'll they'll judge

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,870
her or worse they'll fire her she has

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,160
this sort of imagination of this look on

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,770
their faces and they turn around and

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,260
they say how do you not know that that's

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,940
so basic so she tries to keep up with

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,860
web technologies by reading a lot of

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,660
tutorials and attending events and

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,640
meetups but sometimes she feels that

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,890
everyone else just guessed the things

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,269
that she struggles with there are people

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,340
out there who are writing new and

00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:45,870
awesome frameworks and tools well she

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,060
still trusts struggling to learn the

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,269
previous one and sometimes she just

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,069
feels like a fraud and MO follows a lot

00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,959
of web celebrities on various social

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,970
media platforms to help her stay up to

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,590
date and she's always amazed at how the

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,810
speakers that the events that she

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,060
attends and these social media

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,580
influences they're able to get done they

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,260
seem like they're creative geniuses they

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,630
never have to ask for help they never

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,450
get stuck their days just seem to have

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,420
more hours than hers do and they've all

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,730
got side projects on the go now Mo's got

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,320
a few ideas for side projects but she

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,060
doesn't know how to get started on some

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,130
of them another she just can't seem to

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,540
finish she's worried that people are

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,220
gonna judge them for being too

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,750
unoriginal or too simple

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,760
so she never actually puts them in the

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,450
public eye she just keeps tweaking them

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,609
indefinitely

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,579
and if she's really honest sometimes she

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,810
just doesn't want to face a side project

00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:38,280
she sits at a computer all day at work

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,150
she doesn't want to do it when she gets

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,220
home as well

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,739
and her worried about not keeping up

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,959
with everyone and not being good enough

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,130
tends to bother her throughout the day

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,660
sometimes she's so worried that she

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,579
can't concentrate on what she's doing

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,980
and then she worries that she's wasted

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:55,109
time worrying so she works longer hours

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,150
and she takes fewer and shorter breaks

00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,680
but she still doesn't ask for help

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,370
because that would be giving her secret

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,630
away and in order to hide how worried

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,609
she is about her own lack of knowledge

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,670
she starts attending more events and

00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:10,380
joining web related organizations and

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,850
people often tell her that they don't

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,040
know how she manages to fit it all in

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,320
but she just smiles and shrugs off their

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,850
comments because that means that her her

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,239
cover is working they're never gonna

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,740
find out that she's a fraud most

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,169
sometimes finds that when she gets home

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,970
from work or an event she doesn't have

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,570
the energy to deal with the chores that

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,910
she needs

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,370
around the house or even we're seeing

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,170
friends and her diet has become quite

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,560
poor because of all the free pizza that

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,330
she's eating and she's drinking far more

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,540
alcohol than she used to but you know

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,130
it's a free bar so what you're gonna do

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,240
and even though she gets to bed late she

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,650
struggles to get to sleep at night

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,600
because she can't seem to get her brain

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,850
to switch off it likes to switch between

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,560
worrying about her workload and running

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,330
list of all the jobs that she hasn't got

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,750
done because she's doing so many hours

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,970
of work and her ability to concentrate

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,710
at work continues to suffer because of

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,260
this worry because of her lack of sleep

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,630
because of her poor eating habits and

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,430
she finds herself procrastinating

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,250
instead of getting work done she'll do

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,290
email she'll do social media anything to

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,550
put off actually getting started because

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,770
she's worried that when she does start

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,150
her work is going to be judged and then

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,650
she panics when she thinks that she's

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,990
not got enough done during the day and

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,090
her daily stand-up meetings become this

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,830
absolute dread every morning

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,960
maybe her team is going to wonder why

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,360
she's not being productive maybe they're

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,610
going to fire her by the way her team

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,590
think that she's doing fine they only

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,420
ever see the output of the extra hours

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,280
of work that she puts in not the hours

00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,710
of procrastination that come before it

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,480
and one day while she's at work Moe gets

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,950
a colleague from an email saying that

00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,020
they found a mistake in a piece of work

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,360
that she did and something inside of her

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,830
just kind of snaps and she runs to the

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,900
bathroom because she know she's gonna

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,960
start crying and she doesn't want anyone

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,550
to see she cries uncontrollably it for

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,140
an hour and when she's done she cleans

00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,910
up her face and goes back to her desk

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,710
and pretends that nothing happened

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,900
because everyone else seems to be able

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,840
to cope with their workload they just

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,250
tell her to buck up her ideas it gets to

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,260
the point where most sometimes can't

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,660
even face going into the office so she

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,100
calls in sick on those days but she

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,900
tells her boss that it's her physical

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,540
health bit suffering and not her mental

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,220
health and most mental health continues

00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,500
to suffer she feels like there's a

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,420
constant weight on her chest she has

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,610
heart palpitations during the day and

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,800
she frequently jolts awake at night with

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,420
her heart racing

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,700
finally Moe has a panic attack at work

00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,950
her breathing becomes sharp and shallow

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,020
her vision blurs and she falls on the

00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,640
floor and can't get up

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,080
she finally reaches out to a friend as a

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,759
message saying I

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,770
breathe thankfully fram-o her friend was

00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,900
able to talk her back into calmness and

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,970
helped her to realize that she needed to

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,280
start facing her fears and her anxieties

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,199
she started therapy and she started

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,360
learning about the causes of anxiety and

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,159
stress she learnt that the kind of

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,409
mental health issues that she was facing

00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:03,599
which were anxiety related to impostor

00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:05,120
syndrome and perfectionism actually

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,849
plagued many people in the tech industry

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,860
but often we don't talk about them so if

00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:12,719
you recognize yourself in any of Mo's

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,979
behavior I'd like to talk you through

00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:18,599
some of it now so I'd like to give you a

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,400
short introduction to some of the things

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:22,379
that mo faced along with some questions

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,090
to ask yourself some methods of

00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,009
recognition and some self-care

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,169
techniques so that you don't ever have

00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,909
to go through what she did because I

00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:31,830
truly believe that the tech industry is

00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:33,449
an amazing place to be and we're

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,250
changing the face of so many walks of

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,740
life and our own mental health has to be

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,860
one of them so let's get started let's

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,449
talk about impostor syndrome so you

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,090
might have heard it called impostor

00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:47,159
phenomenon or impostor experience but

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,449
impostor syndrome describes the feeling

00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:51,270
that you haven't really earned your

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,460
accomplishments that by fraud or just

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,469
dumb luck you've ended up in the same

00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,300
place as others that you deem worthy and

00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:59,340
you don't feel like you deserve to be

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,650
there and to call it a syndrome

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,569
downplays how universal this feeling is

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,639
it's not a disease it's not an

00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:09,360
abnormality and it isn't necessarily

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,460
tied to depression or anxiety but it is

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,310
prevalent in highly skilled and highly

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,940
intelligent people just like the people

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:20,069
who like to work in the tech industry so

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,599
where do these feelings come from people

00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:23,279
like yourselves who are skilled and

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,779
intelligent tend to think that your

00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,969
colleagues are also skilled and

00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:28,889
intelligent but this can sometimes cause

00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:32,010
you to judge yourself against others and

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:33,390
to do so unfairly and harshly this

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,089
judgment can cause you to believe that

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,919
you deserve the opportunities or the

00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:40,320
qualifications or the accolades that you

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,000
vant or that in some way the skills that

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,880
you've gathered aren't as praiseworthy

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,130
as the skills of other people and this

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,930
can also be coupled by a belief that any

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,320
qualifications our accolades you haven't

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,940
aren't worthwhile anymore have you ever

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,040
driven to achieve something

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,830
to feel like it came too easy or that

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,190
someone maybe made a mistake in awarding

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,510
it to you or that it isn't enough it

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,280
didn't bring you that feeling of

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,930
completion that you were hoping for and

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,200
you have to start striving for the next

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,940
thing and the next thing impostor

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,060
syndrome doesn't let you feel any pride

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,650
or joy in your achievements and another

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,540
problem with impostor syndrome is that

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,430
our fears can be intensified by a

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,210
phenomenon known as pluralistic

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:26,100
ignorance this is where we doubt

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,380
ourselves in private but we never voice

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,240
our doubts we believe that we're alone

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,770
in thinking that way because no one else

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,190
is talking about their worries either

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,630
and this can be especially exacerbated

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,430
by things like social media where people

00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,100
tend to only present their best

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,900
achievements and their successes people

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,000
rarely purposefully publish their

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,830
mistakes or their self doubts or their

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,110
foibles so it becomes really difficult

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,570
to know how we're doing in comparison to

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,160
our peers or how difficult they find

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,920
certain tasks or whether or not they

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,180
ever get stuck or need to ask for help

00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,730
or whether or not they ever doubt

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,830
themselves this means that there's no

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,720
easy way for us to dismiss the feeling

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,510
that were less capable than those around

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,640
us so with a view to sharing how

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,930
prevalent this issue is I'd like to

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,700
share with you some famous and

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:15,000
incredible people who have suffered from

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,400
impostor syndrome so first off Maya

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,100
Angelou who's written 11 books and won

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,690
many many awards felt like she hadn't

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,820
really aren't her accomplishments she

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:26,540
felt like she'd run a game on everybody

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,430
and that they were going to find her out

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,320
even the seemingly confident and

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,330
talented Emma Watson feels like she

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,890
doesn't deserve her achievements she

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,610
said I don't deserve any of what I've

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:40,920
achieved and if you can believe it even

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,930
Albert Einstein experienced impostor

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,300
syndrome he described himself as an

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,150
involuntary swindler whose work didn't

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,930
didn't deserve as much respect as it had

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:53,520
received and talking with others about

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,410
impostor syndrome is the best way to

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,600
start recognizing your fears for what

00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,160
they are they're normal but they're

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,330
immaterial and they're certainly

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:05,490
unfactual whenever anyone whenever I'm

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,630
wearing that everyone around me knows

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,250
more than me or the

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,810
I don't belong I'd like to think of this

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,210
thing that I call Schrodinger is

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,190
imposter syndrome this is where I have

00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,960
convinced myself that all of my peers

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,390
are far more intelligent and

00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,190
accomplished than I am and I'm just some

00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,070
idiot who doesn't deserve to be around

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,860
them but somehow they are also so

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,930
gullible and stupid that clever me has

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,300
tricked them into thinking that I belong

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,550
amongst them now these two statements

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,980
can't exist alongside each other and be

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,440
true my logic is fallible and therefore

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,110
likely so is my delete disbelief in

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,960
myself and we may never be able to

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,090
banish impostor experience entirely but

00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,370
we can have open and frank conversations

00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,440
with our peers with our seniors with our

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,080
mentors and our friends and build

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,090
confidence that many people feel this

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,930
way and it doesn't mean that we have to

00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:59,430
give it any credit so the second thing

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,830
that I'd like to talk to you about is

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:04,470
perfectionism and when I was preparing

00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:06,390
for my first ever job interview for a

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,850
tech job I was given this piece of

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,880
advice which I'm sure all of you have

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,950
heard if an interviewer ever asks you

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,990
what your weaknesses are just tell them

00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,460
you're a perfectionist now this

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,950
particular piece of advice was given to

00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,900
me and countless others by my boss in my

00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,460
job at the time and it's the kind of

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,320
statement that makes eyes were all

00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,030
across the board everyone knows that

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,040
there's a cop-out answer because you're

00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:30,750
not really revealing a weakness right

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,060
because employers want to hire

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:36,900
perfectionists perfectionists do great

00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,580
work right they do perfect work and it

00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,830
never occurred to me at the time as I

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,110
naively accepted this older and more

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,790
experienced man's instruction that I'd

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:49,140
grow to learn the real truth behind this

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:51,420
statement perfectionism in psychology is

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,520
a personality trait characterized by a

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,530
person striving for flawlessness and

00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,140
setting high performance standards

00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,910
accompanied by critical self evaluations

00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,840
and concerns regarding others

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:06,120
evaluations saves Wikipedia which sounds

00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,230
great if I was an employer I'd want to

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,300
hire someone who strives for

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,910
flawlessness who sets high standards and

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,250
cares about others evaluations they

00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,870
sound like a real achiever

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,150
however perfectionism can often be a

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,620
blocker to achievement imagine that

00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,160
you're constantly striving for

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,790
perfection

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,459
not greatness not excellence actual

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,350
perfection you can't help but set

00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:31,620
yourself up to fail achieving perfection

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:35,069
is not something that happens to most

00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,170
projects and perfectionist measure our

00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:39,509
own self-worth by how able we are to

00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:42,839
achieve this perfection by how much we

00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:44,490
can accomplish and if accomplishments

00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,350
aren't attained we can be very harsh on

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,509
ourselves the trouble is that for

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,670
perfectionists our performance is

00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:52,079
intertwined with our sense of self when

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,389
we don't succeed we don't just feel

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,829
disappointment in how we did we feel

00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:59,699
shame about who we are and

00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:01,620
perfectionists often engage in this

00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,639
thing called catastrophic or you might

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,769
have heard it called black and white

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,319
thinking where everything becomes either

00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:09,360
perfect or terrible and even things that

00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:11,730
most people would call great or good

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,519
enough fall into the terrible category

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,470
an example could be fear of publishing a

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,500
piece of work because somebody might

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,060
find an error in it the idea of somebody

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,209
finding an error becomes this end of

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,740
world scenario that you can't even face

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:27,089
rather than something manageable that

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,389
you could work through if and when it

00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:32,279
happens and I was diagnosed as a

00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,380
perfectionist about two years ago and

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,060
for me it was a relief to finally have a

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,550
name to put to the stress that I was

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,550
feeling every time I made a mistake or

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:43,410
had a mental block I spiraled into this

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,540
depression and a kind of decision

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,209
paralysis or I couldn't decide how to

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,980
move forwards which made my mental block

00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:53,069
worse and it made my disgust with myself

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,319
greater one time the anxiety that I felt

00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:57,269
over my failure to produce a perfect

00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:59,339
piece of work was so bad then it

00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:01,410
manifested into crippling neck pain and

00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,000
the doctors had to put me on valium to

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,660
force me to actually take some time I

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,089
hoped and the problem is that the tech

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,680
industry and capitalism and our society

00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:13,110
as a whole love it when we strive for

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,569
perfection they want us to be constantly

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,430
building better faster things be the

00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:19,259
most successful and the most money so

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,050
that you can spend it on becoming even

00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,910
more successful and tack employers often

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,649
encourage the unhealthy belief that we

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:28,439
should constantly be striving to work

00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:31,319
harder create more to learn everything

00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:32,170
as if it's even impossible if as if it

00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:35,410
is even possible

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,240
to learn everything and we start to feel

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,370
guilt when we're not working and we

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,230
shame ourselves for taking breaks we

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,110
work on our sick days and we answer our

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,520
emails when we were on holiday and

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,290
perfectionist employees will pressure

00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,360
themselves into tiredness into

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,700
depression and burnout all while

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,130
continuing to turn in excellent work

00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,720
never daring to ask for help because

00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,790
that would be admitting that they can't

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,360
do something that they can't be perfect

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,560
a much like those with impostor syndrome

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,790
perfectionists often disregard their own

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,860
accomplishments because they're not

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,510
enough as soon as something that they

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,790
were working towards is achieved is

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,470
achieved its instantly disregarded

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,660
because it doesn't bring that perfect

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,070
feeling that they were hoping for so

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,170
they immediately start working on the

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,660
next thing and the next thing and it's

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,790
an unsustainable and unhappy way to work

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,300
and will very quickly lead to overwork

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:27,130
and burnout so if you're not sure

00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,020
whether you've ever had perfectionist

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,690
tendencies I'd like to ask you a few

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,450
questions to consider and firstly this

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:39,100
is the one that got me which you

00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:41,140
consider yourself a perfectionist now if

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,480
you answer as I did something along the

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:47,320
lines of oh no there's no way I'm good

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,380
enough to be a perfectionist then I'm

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,180
afraid I've got some news for you have

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,680
you ever felt like you can't start a

00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,200
project cuz you can't decide on how to

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,180
start somehow figuring out the perfect

00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,430
way to start is a blocker to even

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,230
getting started have you ever found

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,930
yourself repeatedly scrolling through

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,510
social media or watching reruns on

00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,760
Netflix or even tidying your house when

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:12,130
you knew you should be getting started

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,720
on a project and perfectionist

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,089
procrastinate when we don't know how to

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,650
start to finish a project not working on

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,480
the project means that it can never not

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,020
be perfect because it's never going to

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,760
be finished have your left the project

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,220
unfinished because you couldn't get it

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,680
exactly how you wanted it it feels it's

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,050
not quite perfect yet so you're just

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,240
gonna keep adding bits and tweaking bits

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,100
but you're not actually not quite ready

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,940
to show it to anybody yet or get

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:42,220
anyone's opinion on it have you ever

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,350
felt afraid or ashamed about asking for

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,260
help from a colleague or peer because

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,370
maybe

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,380
I'll show them that you don't know

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,120
something or that you can't manage

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,170
something and perfect people know

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,790
everything right better just to try that

00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,650
1000 google search then to turn to the

00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:01,010
person next to you and ask how to do the

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,600
thing so what can we do both as

00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,520
perfectionist and Friends of

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,930
perfectionist to make the tech industry

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,100
a better safer and kind of place to be

00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:12,740
so the first thing that you need to do

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,110
is to give yourself time sometimes you

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,370
just can't tackle a problem it's okay it

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,990
doesn't mean that you'll never be able

00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,570
to tackle it it just means that you

00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,370
can't do it right now give yourself some

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:24,950
time out and don't let feelings of guilt

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,530
or shame take over take a half an hour

00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,840
walk or even a whole day or two away

00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,160
from the problem but schedule in a start

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,260
time for when you're going to try and

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:37,130
tackle it again in the future once

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,900
you're feeling calm set deadlines and

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,910
goals and targets that are realistic

00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,580
either set them for yourself or ask

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,260
someone just help set them with you too

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,360
much freedom can be stifling for

00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,090
perfectionists we need something to aim

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,860
for and then to improve upon given a

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,200
blank canvas will panic or will

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,240
procrastinate or will start and abandon

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,280
multiple projects setting achievable

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,880
goals will allow you to strive for

00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,860
perfection or excellence while removing

00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,680
the paralyzing nature of the open-ended

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,150
task and setting schedules and deadlines

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,790
means that at some point you will be

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:15,800
encouraged to start the work that you're

00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:17,660
procrastinating on remember that perfect

00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,940
is the enemy of great perfectionism

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,070
isn't about high standards

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,620
it's about unrealistic and unachievable

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,270
standards getting something out is

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,700
better than abandoning all of your hard

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,050
work and you'll likely be surprised that

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,240
no one else will notice those

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,340
imperfections that you thought were

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,820
blockers they'll probably think that

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,620
your work is great and try to

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,930
acknowledge that you are your own most

00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,580
harsh critic most people don't expect

00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,170
for perfection from other people

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,510
perfectionists only think that they do

00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,940
no one is going to judge you as harshly

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:52,610
as you judge yourself it's okay to make

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,130
mistakes everybody does it it's even

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,440
okay to release code with mistakes in it

00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,820
it's even okay if somebody sees a

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,190
mistake in your

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,409
and tells you about it you can thank

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,029
them you will learn something new you

00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:08,089
will both move on with your lives and

00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:09,649
the world will not end it's easy to

00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:11,199
start putting yourself down when you

00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:13,489
don't meet your own unachievable

00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:15,619
expectations but consider how you'd

00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:17,509
react if somebody said the things that

00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:19,820
you're thinking about yourself to one of

00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:24,379
your friends or even if they just said

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:26,359
them out loud now this is one that

00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:27,639
really helps me try and think your fears

00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,659
through to their logical conclusion

00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:31,819
instead of the catastrophic or

00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:33,440
black-and-white thinking like if I make

00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:35,179
a mistake in front of my colleagues that

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,039
would be the end of the world

00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:39,619
consider what the end of the world would

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,409
actually look like consider the worst

00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:44,059
possible outcome of your fear and then

00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,609
be honest with yourself about how likely

00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:48,469
that scenario actually is and then you

00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:51,919
can start to consider how such an event

00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:54,199
might actually occur so let's say we've

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,369
released some code and it has a mistake

00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:59,509
in it instead of our oh my goodness that

00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:00,949
would be the end of the world

00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:03,289
let's think about the worst thing that

00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:05,479
could possibly happen our colleague

00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:07,389
finds a mistake our colleague stands up

00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:11,449
in the middle of the room and says you

00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:15,349
made a mistake get out you never come

00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:17,839
back and you know it's shared around the

00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:19,789
entire internet that you made a mistake

00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,909
you will never be hired in the tech

00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:25,819
industry again now how likely is that

00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:28,159
outcome is it more likely that perhaps

00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,539
your colleague will go oh I noticed a

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,829
mistake could you update that when

00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:35,209
you've got some time yeah try and work

00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:37,039
your fears through to their logical

00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:39,169
conclusion and you can get past that

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,449
catastrophic black-and-white thinking

00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:45,049
teaching yourself to do this will save

00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:46,699
you hours of worrying and the more that

00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:48,409
I've spoken about my experiences with

00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:51,319
perfectionism the more people have told

00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:53,419
me about their own similar experiences

00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:55,099
and with the tendency for intelligence

00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:57,319
and achievement in tech industry

00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:59,029
employees it's perhaps unsurprising

00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:01,129
there's so many of us suffer from

00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:03,709
perfectionism and the more we talk about

00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:05,269
these issues the less stigma we'll feel

00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:07,399
around dealing with them and around

00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:09,049
helping others through them we can

00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:12,019
validate our own and each other's

00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:12,500
experience it's okay to say yeah this is

00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:15,650
hard

00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,120
sometimes Tech is hard the more open and

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,490
communicative we are about mental health

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,500
in the tech industry the more pleasant a

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:24,920
working experience we can make for

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,020
everyone and so the final issue that I'd

00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,210
like to talk to you about and that I'd

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,170
like you to watch for in for your watch

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:35,240
in yourselves for is anxiety and the

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,040
anxiety is an entirely normal and

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,290
natural feeling worrying about a new

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,690
experience or a scary situation is

00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,790
understandable but anxiety becomes a

00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,320
problem if you're feeling it generally

00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,930
or if you're feeling it over a long

00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:50,060
period of time there's a there's a

00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,430
theory that says that we learn anxiety

00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,830
is babies that were when we're tiny and

00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:57,290
helpless we are entirely reliant on

00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:00,140
being lovable enough for somebody to

00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:02,390
give us everything that we need and for

00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,190
some of us that need to feel loved and

00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,290
accepted and the worry that were not

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,000
good enough never goes away

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,740
and we constantly need assurance that

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,350
we're doing okay in comparison to

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,030
everybody else and in the last few years

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,190
we've been given some really powerful

00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:18,920
tools for checking how we're doing in

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:21,860
comparison to everybody else social

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,990
media of course I'm talking about you it

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,210
gives us instant validation on our

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,100
decisions in our life choices posting on

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,810
social media gives us a means of

00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,240
presenting the lives that we want our

00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:34,580
lives to be and to get validation in the

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,560
forms of likes and comments but we can't

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,810
help comparing the actuality of our

00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,460
lives with the beautiful idealized

00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:42,740
illustrations that others have put out

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,330
there and we can constantly stoke our

00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,690
own fear that we're doing less well than

00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,700
everyone else and impostor syndrome and

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,680
perfectionism can both be causes of

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,050
anxiety and can impact on your mental

00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,730
well-being and record numbers of people

00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,960
are experiencing poor mental health

00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,720
according to the World Health

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,730
Organization depression anxiety and

00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,310
suicide ideation are more common in the

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:07,610
UK now than they have been ever before

00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:09,530
and a good prediction of depression is

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,240
self-criticism which those with

00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,130
perfectionism and those with impostor

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,140
syndrome are really good at and

00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,410
worsening matters being self-critical

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,790
tends to lead to depressive symptoms but

00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:22,090
those symptoms can then make yourself

00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:24,230
criticism worse and it's horrible loop

00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,070
it's also been shown that one of the

00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,210
best

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,250
protectors against anxiety and

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,750
depression is self-compassion which

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,090
those of us who suffer from impostor

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:36,630
syndrome and excite and perfectionism

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:38,610
are really not very good at so how can

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:42,149
we improve our self compassion and our

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:45,960
self-care because it really does take

00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:47,640
practice and patience so firstly the

00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,429
thing that I would suggest is you need

00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,590
to change where you look for validation

00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:55,289
we're used to the ideas of the external

00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,880
signs of success we get praise from our

00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:58,470
parents when we are younger our teachers

00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,980
give us grades to tell us how we're

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,010
doing

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,200
we take exams and we do tests and

00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:06,240
sometimes when we move on to a job or a

00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,669
career we start feeling the need for

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,270
that validation but we can find it less

00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:14,760
readily so we start looking to unhealthy

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:16,200
sources for that validation we want our

00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,330
boss to tell us that we've done a good

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,980
job we want to be on the highest salary

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,140
that we can be on we want the next

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,970
Twitter or Instagram like but the

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,130
problem with external validation is that

00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,529
it's fleeting you know one or two likes

00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:30,779
on social media can feel great and a

00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:32,520
pay-rise can feel amazing but the

00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,980
problem is that the feeling eventually

00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,549
wears off and we eventually go back to

00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,649
feeling insecure self validation is the

00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:42,539
idea of accepting your own internal

00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:44,640
experience your thoughts your feelings

00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:46,230
and your actions and it's knowing within

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,600
yourself that you're enough and you

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,510
don't need to perform for others it's

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,919
accepting good enough instead of perfect

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:57,090
because really it is good enough

00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,620
learning self validation will allow you

00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:01,500
to calm yourself when you're in that

00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,480
panic or anxiety state and being karma

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,210
will allow you to manage your internal

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,970
mean voice more effectively and remember

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:12,059
to listen to your kind of voice so how

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:13,620
can we learn to self validate the first

00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,600
thing that I would say to do is instead

00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,549
of instantly resolving to change your

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,770
behavior first learn to recognize it in

00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:21,840
yourself when you find yourself engaging

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:24,179
in negative thoughts about yourself or

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,720
in procrastination or checking your work

00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:29,669
slack too often acknowledge it and

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,289
consider it once you've reached a point

00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:33,330
where you can notice yourself engaging

00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:35,279
in that bad habit then you can start

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,340
reasoning with yourself over why and

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,909
reflect on what is causing it if you're

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,099
feeling in

00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:42,989
secur consider whether it's really you

00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:45,389
or a societal pressure that's making you

00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:47,639
feel that way if you find yourself

00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:50,249
procrastinating let yourself have the

00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:52,460
time you clearly want it but schedule in

00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:54,720
a start time for later on in the day and

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,259
if you're checking your work email at

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,539
midnight

00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:59,580
check it close it realize that you did

00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:01,919
it put the phone down don't let yourself

00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,869
do it again but don't berate yourself

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,330
for it acknowledge it accept that it

00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:07,769
happened consider it and then reflect on

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,989
what might have been behind the issue

00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:11,700
where the thought has come from and

00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:15,509
think about how you can manage yourself

00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:17,549
in the future and speaking of reflection

00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:20,249
don't any of you ever have trouble

00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:22,229
getting to sleep at night I have this

00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:24,599
thing where I put my head down on the

00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:26,759
pillow and my brain goes Oh finally you

00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:28,049
stopped with all the distractions let's

00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,200
go through all the embarrassing things

00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:32,849
that you did today and I've just sort of

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,799
lying there sweating instead of getting

00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:37,169
to sleep it turns out you can avoid that

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,509
by spending some downtime either before

00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:41,129
bed or whenever suits you best thinking

00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:43,859
about your day and how it went

00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:46,799
and how you felt about it no phones no

00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:48,599
screens just you and your thoughts try

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,940
and consider only the facts of your

00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:53,399
experience and don't make assumptions so

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,129
I got three bugs fixed today and I feel

00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:57,720
great about it I haven't got that one

00:27:56,129 --> 00:28:00,720
bug fixed though and that's sort of

00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,729
worrying me or my friend canceled on me

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,309
for lunch and I'm kind of pissed those

00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:07,739
are all valid experiences and valid

00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,330
thoughts I didn't get that bug fix

00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:11,399
because I'm a failure and I'm rubbish at

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,590
everything that's an assumption and

00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:15,359
that's not a fact if you catch yourself

00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,279
doing that try and consider where that

00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,109
thought might have come from are you

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,729
being driven by a need for a perfection

00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:23,899
are you believing the stories of

00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:25,859
capitalism or dare I say the patriarchy

00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:27,720
accepting only the facts of your

00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:30,539
experience will help you to build trust

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,249
in yeren own internal validation and

00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:35,999
they'll help you to catch the bad habits

00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:38,609
quicker and there are so many management

00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:41,190
methods for us to put in place if you

00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:42,149
want it there's work timing techniques

00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,340
like Pomodoro

00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:46,559
there's extensions for your browser

00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,320
which can shut off social media over

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,059
certain hours both iOS and Android

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,429
let you turn your phone to grayscale

00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:55,919
during certain hours or grayscale out

00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:57,990
certain apps if you have a tendency to

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,539
work too many hours try cutting down

00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,950
even in half an hour increments and see

00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:05,009
whether or not it makes a difference to

00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,419
how effective you're being and allow

00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:08,580
your friends to help you through that

00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:11,100
catastrophic thinking if you can't get

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,799
through to that sensible way of thinking

00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,389
next time you're having a it'll be the

00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,549
end of the world scenario just get your

00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:20,669
friend to turn to you and say well what

00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:23,340
then after the world end what happens

00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:25,620
tomorrow but find the things that work

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,480
best for you and give them a chance and

00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,460
be truthful with yourself about what is

00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,769
and what isn't working because we're

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:35,490
really trying to change habits here and

00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:37,110
it takes time and finally get in touch

00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,870
with what helps to calm you when you're

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,700
feeling anxious or overtired or just in

00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,620
the need of a little bit of me time for

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,740
some people it's a walk around the block

00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:49,379
or listening to music meditation or

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,909
taking a bubble bath but it has to be

00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:52,740
able to come from you and not from

00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:54,539
somebody else it should be things that

00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,019
reduce your blood pressure and don't

00:29:54,539 --> 00:30:00,600
raise it so posting to Twitter doesn't

00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:03,110
count that's external validation texting

00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,000
your crush also sorry doesn't count

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:08,690
eating a kilo of chocolate or drinking a

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,740
liter of coffee also don't count

00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,779
self-soothing is things that you can do

00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,240
for yourself to give yourself time to

00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:17,789
feel validated and happy and to step

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,590
back out of that panic and anxiety state

00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:23,190
to a place where you can start thinking

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:25,440
calmly again and why am I telling you

00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,750
all of these things because I never want

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,110
anyone else to go through what I did in

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:33,059
case you didn't guess mo is me I don't

00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,889
want anyone to feel alone or unsupported

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:36,750
because I really think that by talking

00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:38,549
about it we can increase awareness and

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,799
learning about mental health in the tech

00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:43,620
industry because the tech industry can

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,779
be a wonderful empowering and brilliant

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,740
place to be and we all deserve to be

00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:53,549
there thank you very much for listening

00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,549
