	How I got my 1st Javascript Job by Eleftheria Batsou

Do you ever feel like you’re stuck in your career? Do you constantly feel like you don’t have time to work on your projects? Do you want to learn something new, expand your knowledge, develop yourself and be the best you can be?
In this session, I am going to share my story on how I started coding, how I make time to work on side projects and how you can grow and advance in your career. After this talk, I hope you'll be inspired to work smarter, make new habits and continue pushing yourself even when things fall apart.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,559
uh feel free to catch up with me on

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,200
twitter i'm quite active there

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:48,879
but also on email or on instagram too

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,520
all right and now let's get started

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,719
so in this session we will talk about my

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,920
coding journey and

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,280
how i eventually got my first javascript

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,359
developer's job

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,359
we will continue with some tips and

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,960
techniques of habit formation and how

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,560
that can help me

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,960
or even like you and last but not least

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,040
about dealing with stress and

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,560
frustration

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,400
all right let's get started so

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,320
um my coding journey i graduated from an

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,960
engineering university which

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,439
means that i did a lot of maths a lot of

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,360
physics a lot of electronics

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,320
but not so much of coding

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,040
i realized that i wanted to have a

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,840
coding

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,320
job uh because i did some internships i

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,320
did one

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,240
internship in greece and another one in

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,920
the netherlands and i

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,680
had some internship working as a

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,000
front-end developer

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,119
but i was looking through different kind

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,680
of jobs

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,439
and i was saying that i didn't have all

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
of those things that they were asking

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,399
for

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,439
i actually didn't have any of those

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,079
things

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,799
so one day as i was doing my internship

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,159
abroad

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,960
i started reading an article it

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,759
was a medium it was written by the

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,160
creator of the challenge 100

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:15,360
3 100 days of code named alex calway

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,599
and in this article he was saying how

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
you can take part in that particular

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,160
challenge

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,879
and what are the benefits of this

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,599
challenge and as i was reading that

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,120
article

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,879
i thought that this is exactly what i

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,840
need so i was like

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,959
challenge accepted so what i had to do

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,640
in that

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,840
challenge it was to code for one hour

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,560
every single day for 100 days

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,080
and i should upload all my code in

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
github

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,680
which that eventually would help me to

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,319
build the portfolio

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,840
by that moment i didn't have portfolio i

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,959
didn't even know what github

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,400
was and i was like struggling a little

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,680
bit with that

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,480
but also like the third point was to

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,440
tweet using the hashtag of 100 days of

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,080
code and also

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,560
encourage other people to take part in

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,560
the

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,760
challenge or support them in their

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,800
projects

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,000
by that time i was not even using

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,360
twitter so i had a lot of things

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,720
to cover i started eventually doing

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,519
all of those things and the first

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,560
question

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,200
that i got from other people was

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,519
yes but what do you code what do you

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,560
like to do

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,360
well i like to do a lot of things

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,280
and thankfully there are also a lot of

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,599
different ways that you can learn that

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,799
you can take inspiration from

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,959
and for me some sources that i used was

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,480
like online educational platform

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,879
such as udemy udacity pluralsight and

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,840
numerous other sites obviously then

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,159
youtube which

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,360
youtube has a lot of quality content and

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,280
you can find things

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,799
even if you are a beginner or a more

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,040
advanced person

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,280
then there are like online communities

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,319
like stack overflow

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,400
hello but also some discord servers some

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,360
other channels that you can go like i

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,599
have a question

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,560
and people like usually very gladly they

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,759
will give you an

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,799
answer there are also some other coding

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
challenges

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,000
so far i've only mentioned 100 days of

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,000
code but

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,320
there but there are other challenges and

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,520
we will talk about them shortly

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,479
like a daily css images or

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,960
uh 50 days 50 sites and stuff like that

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,840
that

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,960
each day they give you a theme to code

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,360
or they send you

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,479
a video a tutorial video or they send

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,040
you some links

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,880
some stuff to read about so they can

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,120
also be very helpful

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,800
and of course the other thing is

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,280
magazines and books

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,720
i read a lot of online magazines it's

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,080
something that i believe it has really

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
helped me it has helped me with

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,520
motivation

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,000
it gives me ideas about things to build

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,039
it shows me what other things are doing

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,960
so

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,240
like reading magazines and obviously

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,880
books it's really

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,720
really really helpful if you want to be

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080
a javascript developer or if you're

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
interested in javascript

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,560
and you're still in your very first

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,520
steps i would suggest you be a looking

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,919
javascript it's an amazing book that i

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,520
believe

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,880
everyone should read and also from the

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,120
other hand if you are

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,360
struggling to find inspiration for your

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,639
projects again there are numerous things

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
that i would suggest you

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,000
and some things that have really really

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,400
helped me is

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,759
as i said reading blogs browsing

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,800
different forums and

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,280
publications through medium through dev

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,479
to

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,120
through hashnote hacker noon

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,840
you can find literally so many things

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
which

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,600
are free and you can adjust your level

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,919
again

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
either you are a beginner or a more

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,240
advanced person

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,000
and obviously like go to meetups attend

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,319
to meetups and conferences

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
which i'm pretty sure that you're

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,479
already doing that

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,759
since you are watching this um this

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,280
session and you are here

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,600
now the other thing was what exactly i

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,560
wanted to learn because as i said my

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,440
goal was to be a javascript developer

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,639
so i thought that i should start from

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,479
the basic things

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:28,000
and for me those basic things was html

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,560
css and javascript but i should also

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,199
learn

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,720
git and github because i was seeing

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,400
everyone using it

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,400
the challenge said that i should use

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,639
that but i had no idea how to do that

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,240
and of course i wanted to stop being

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,360
afraid of the console

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,240
and the developer tools and the network

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,639
tabs that

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,479
i was seeing like the other developers

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,800
we were using those things like

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,319
as i said i was doing an internship so i

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,160
had already an idea

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,039
of what i wanted to do and i could see

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,960
what other developers were doing

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,800
and the last part of my challenge like

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,160
the last thing that i wanted to

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,599
learn at least for that very first step

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,919
was to learn a framework i decided to go

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,880
with angularjs

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,880
now i know that that wasn't the best

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,720
idea because angularjs

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,160
as you may know is going to be

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,319
duplicated

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,400
but back then it wasn't like that and

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,639
the other thing was to learn a data

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,000
visualization library and stick with

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,120
d3gs

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,840
which that was a pretty good idea

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,720
and i will tell you in a bit why it was

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,639
a good idea

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,759
for me and for my personal journey

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,440
so uh what did i build through

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,560
that challenge i started working as i

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,759
said with html and css and i took part

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,120
in another challenge

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,960
called daily css images in that

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,599
challenge for 50 days i was coding

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,080
every day a different theme using only

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,360
html and css so the images that you're

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,960
seeing right now

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,759
um are done only with css and that first

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,800
my sketches are and my designs were

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
pretty simple

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
but i think that as the time progressed

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,080
i also got better with that

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
and my designs got better hopefully they

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,000
got better

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,199
but then i started also working with

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,440
javascript and

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
this is the tic-tac-toe game and the

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,360
inspiration

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
is coming from free code camp free good

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,719
camp

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,800
is like a really nice source to learn

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,680
everything that has to do with front-end

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,360
development

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,880
and also there are some amazing things

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,479
for back-end developers

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,599
security and interviews and stuff like

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,760
that

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,720
this is also another game the simon says

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,959
game

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,760
and it's built with javascript pure

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,920
javascript

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,279
now that i see those projects i can

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,720
understand how far

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,680
i have gone but if anyone is still in

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,560
that um

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,320
or is starting his or her journey on

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,360
coding i would suggest you go

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,600
through similar projects

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
also as i said i worked a little bit

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,200
with angularjs

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,240
i started building some small projects

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,959
there

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,360
and some bigger projects there i started

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,480
to

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,600
implement and try to implement some more

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,279
advanced games

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,080
let's say but i also started learning

00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,120
d3gs and

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,320
as i said this actually helped me

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,680
a lot because eventually i

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,880
found my first free lansing

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,000
job as d3

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,320
developer d3 is a data visualization

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,440
library and you can do so many great

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,200
things

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,920
so it was like such a relief for me

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,000
because when i found that job i really

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,399
didn't have any experience

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,279
the only thing that i had done was to

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,959
show

00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:02,079
and to prove that i know d3gs

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,360
how i did that how i showed that i know

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,640
d3gs

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,680
was by building small projects

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,120
and while i was building those projects

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,120
i was actually recording myself and

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,560
all the code and everything could be

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,839
found on youtube

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,560
and on github so eventually

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,959
some people noticed that and they said

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,560
that

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:29,120
hey we have a small project for you we

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,040
know what you're capable of doing so do

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,560
you want to work with us

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,920
and that's how i got my first

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,920
remote developer d3

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,240
job um this is also like

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,600
part of another challenge it's called

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,760
the daily ui and in that challenge i was

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,399
working not only with coding

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,279
but with design too because eventually

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,360
my

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,360
mindset changed a little bit and i

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,160
didn't want to work only with front-end

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,920
development

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:05,680
but also with design as well

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,560
so uh by that time by the time that i

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,640
had uh that i was about to finish the

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,839
challenge of 100 days of code

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,160
i had moved on like i had finished with

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,880
my

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
internship i had started looking for

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,959
jobs

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,120
and a lot of people through my

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,519
interviews they were asking me

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,440
uh because they knew that it was my

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,320
first job they were asking me about my

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,399
projects

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,000
and this time i had to show them

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,079
something because i had

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,839
a portfolio i had a portfolio through

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,680
github and i could show them the

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,399
projects that i have done

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,959
i had also started my youtube channel so

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,720
they could

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,160
see my youtube channel and they could

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,399
see what i was capable of

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,440
doing they could see some small projects

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,880
on um

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,560
on d3gs and on javascript and obviously

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,839
on html and css too

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,040
so i also mentioned some other

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,079
challenges

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,120
so let's very quickly go through them

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,000
i started with 100 days of code

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,079
and if you take a look on the date you

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,440
can see it right here

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,839
you will see that it's actually just one

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
day

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,760
before the new year so maybe everyone

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,560
like

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,519
that last day they are out and partying

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,279
okay maybe

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,320
not right now but people do that and i

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,519
was home

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,680
i was coding it was my first day

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,200
and i also did another challenge the

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,399
javascript 30 the daily scissors images

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,600
which again if you take a look on

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,720
that date it is

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,600
on valentine's day so maybe i

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,079
also didn't have anything better to do

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,040
and

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,120
eventually i kept going with other

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,200
challenges and other challenges and

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,399
other challenges i did quite a few of

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,760
them i know

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,920
someone could say that i'm a bit

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,480
addicted to them but i just

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,240
like it and it really it really gives me

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,240
a boost and a motivation

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,200
on keep going so i started also talking

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,560
a little bit with

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,760
motivation and inspiration and as i was

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,800
using

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,720
twitter more and more people were

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,360
started asking me that particular

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,040
question like how can you be so inspired

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,839
or what motivates you

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,079
to keep going and keep doing all those

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,760
things

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:32,560
well uh for me the answer is

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,519
quite simple like if you want to do

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,639
something

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:40,160
just do it there is no one that will

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,560
stop you if you feel that you

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,000
really have to do something again just

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,399
do it

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,519
let people know what you want to do what

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,880
you want to build

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,480
and again start doing it you don't have

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,320
to wait for a

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,880
monday you don't have to wait for a new

00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,320
week for new month or for new year

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,240
just start doing things and maybe the

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,959
inspiration and the motivation is

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,000
different for anyone maybe for me it's

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,040
just the

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,959
the need that i wanted to get better but

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,760
maybe for someone else this is something

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,519
different

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,079
maybe someone wants like to get the

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,040
promotion so he or she has to learn

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,040
something new

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,079
maybe they want some extra money so they

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,360
have to learn

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,480
again something new whatever the reason

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,079
is

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,800
just start working from for that thing

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,880
like

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:36,000
right now start working

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,320
so uh what did i gain by

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,519
doing that challenge of 100 days of

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,360
codes and

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:47,120
why it has helped me so much well

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,839
the thing is that my goal was to learn

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,160
javascript and find a job as a

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,040
javascript developer and eventually i

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,600
did that

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,079
on the last three days of the challenge

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,199
i

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,240
found a job in my city it was like a

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,279
nice job

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,600
it gave me so many things and

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,800
it was my first job but upon that i

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,480
started building

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,120
more and more so again from this

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,519
challenge

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,600
i learned to be more optimistic and

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,000
grateful for the things that i have

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,399
and the people that are around me

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,519
because trust me you have to be also a

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,880
little bit patient

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,440
uh like coding for 100 days straight

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,920
i met a lot of people and i learned to

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,199
believe

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,920
more in myself and in my powers i

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,920
certainly got better at time management

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,600
because when you have to code every day

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,519
when you have to go to work

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,639
when you have to do a master's maybe you

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,399
have a family

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,199
maybe you have a home to support maybe

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,959
you have kids so you really need to be

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,079
good at time management and i also had

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,880
the opportunity to

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,279
travel quite a lot maybe this is seems

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,320
quite

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,560
irrelevant but it's actually not as a

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,040
developer you have many opportunities to

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,399
travel

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,519
either for work or being a freelancer

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,839
or going to meetups and conferences so

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,759
that's also how i started traveling

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,079
because i have like two passions coding

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,519
and

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:17,040
traveling um

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,720
okay so would i recommend a challenge

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,880
like that the short answer is yes like

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,079
definitely yes if you want to get better

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,360
if you want to improve

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,560
if you want to connect with people just

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,040
do it do it and it will like truly help

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,360
you

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,399
and if you have like any question um on

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,120
that again like

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,399
feel free to contact me on social media

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,600
or over an email

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,320
and we can discuss it more

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,079
now let's continue with the second part

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,920
of this session which is tips and

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,480
techniques of habit formation

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:56,160
because coding and sticking to a goal

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,560
should be a habit if you want to improve

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,360
if you want to get better that should

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,759
also

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:07,280
be a habit so let's start with a quote

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,039
that i really like and it says

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,720
i'm not telling you it's going to be

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,919
easy i'm telling you

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,880
it's going to be worth it

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,880
so i'm not telling you that coding and

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,919
finding for new jobs and going to

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,959
interviews and

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,000
like having this rejection rejections

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,039
is going to be easy but i'm telling

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,679
you that it's going to be worth it i'm

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,120
really

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,400
glad that that day the last day of

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,440
uh before going to the new year that i

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,600
was at home i was in my desk i was

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,200
actually in that exact same position

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,039
that i am right now

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,320
and i started my journey was it easy

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:53,840
no had i a lot of rejections

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,880
yes i had but these didn't stop me like

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,919
that didn't stop me

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,320
okay so the first thing about habits is

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,000
that

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,200
you will feel some resistance resistance

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,679
is always there

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,559
and it always gets you like try to do

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,799
something good

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,760
try to do something positive and it's

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,400
always there

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,679
it doesn't have to do always with job

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,960
related things

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:22,160
like for example think about when you um

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,960
when you are on a diet that you will see

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,880
a cookie

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,640
and you will want to eat that cookie

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,600
although you know that you shouldn't eat

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,160
that

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,880
this is resistance resistance is always

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,919
there and

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,039
it always gets you

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,160
the other thing is that

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,440
there are some things that you can do to

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,760
eliminate those uh like those

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,880
uh restrictions and those resistance

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,000
things

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,520
and that thing is the power of

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,080
limits is set limits don't spray your

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,559
effort

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,600
around so i focus on one thing at a time

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,039
for me that was

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,799
html secondly css thirdly javascript so

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,880
focus on one thing at the time

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,240
it doesn't matter what it is just focus

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,440
on that thing

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,840
don't multitask multitask doesn't

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,559
work if you don't trust my word just

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
google it

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,080
and you will see like see the service

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,440
and stuff like that and you will see

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,919
that multitasking

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,039
doesn't work so stick at one thing at a

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,160
time

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,160
try for consistency over volume so say

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,000
that you will do that you will see it

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,919
maybe for even 30 minutes

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
every day and you will do something for

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,840
yourself don't try to do

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,360
everything for example in the weekend

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,320
because you think that in the weekend

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,280
you will have

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,400
more time no start building something

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,200
small

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,520
every single day even for a few minutes

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,679
and

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,440
don't overload your weekends or your

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,360
nights

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,039
it's better to have just a little free

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,679
time rather than too much

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,960
and maybe this is a little bit weird for

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,400
some people

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,240
but the thing is that when you have a

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,039
lot of free time you will say

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,440
okay i'm going to do that later or later

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,799
or

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,240
later and eventually you never do it

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,720
am i right the thing is that

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,799
if you have like a nice program and i

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,760
schedule a to-do list you will see that

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,480
you will start

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,200
doing everything even if you have just a

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,400
little time

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,480
you will do everything

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,640
something else that may help you is

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,480
strike progress visually the image

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,240
that you can see right now is coming

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,480
from my github account

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,919
while i was doing the challenge of 100

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
days of code

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,159
it's a mental thing that it will say

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,360
like don't break the chain

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,480
and always keep a log or a calendar or a

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,120
to-do list

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,240
it doesn't matter what this to-do list

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,919
is going to be or

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,159
where it's going to be written it

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,039
doesn't matter if you're using a fancy

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,039
app or just a simple pen and paper just

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,280
write everything down and start

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,440
working on that you don't want to break

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,840
the chain you want to always work on

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,000
those

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,120
little tasks and i have like little task

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,760
notes big ones

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,360
these are all tips that they can help

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,679
you

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,960
now the other thing is that you want to

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,440
stay away

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,679
from toxic environment like no matter

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,640
what you want to stay away from there

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,280
from those things so uh as i mentioned

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,320
earlier if you are for example in a diet

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,320
like don't go for the cookie uh even

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,720
better like don't have cookies or ice

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,000
cream at your home like always keep

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,919
fruits and other healthy

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,640
foods around you and the same goes with

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,440
coding like if you want to code set up

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,480
everything

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,320
nice and clear don't try to remember

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,480
like your passwords like have them

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,919
somewhere written like any keypass or

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,400
something like that

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,840
and um other things that they can help

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,960
you is like

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,640
block all the notifications

00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,679
block all the distraction set up

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,480
a limit that you will work on that time

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,200
slot

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,400
and as i have already mentioned for a

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,960
hundredth time

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,600
start working like let the other people

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,480
know that

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,679
you want to do something or you want an

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,799
hour for yourself

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,679
so they cannot distract you they

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,080
won't call you and like always having

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,799
your

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,880
phone away or have it like in a silent

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,679
mode have it in a different room

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,240
so you will not catch up your phone as

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,200
you read or as you study or as you code

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,400
or as you

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,880
design um

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,440
okay and some other things that about

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,480
habits

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,760
is that a habit is like a loop

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,600
and in fit an infinite loop you want

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,039
the first thing is to trigger something

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,320
that it will trigger you

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,720
so you will start doing things the other

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,360
thing

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,159
is the routines or the actual habits and

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,440
the last thing

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,600
is the reward that you will feel

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,559
like you did something the reward can be

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,280
something either

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,640
physical or not the reward can be

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,120
something mentally

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,440
but the loop is always like that like

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,880
trigger retuning reward and that's how

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,480
you build up your

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,880
habits some other things that they can

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,760
probably help you is the bright line

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
rules

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,600
and this is like going from something

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,520
general to something specific

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,080
so as i've already mentioned when you're

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,960
having like a to-do list

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,200
you can have a general idea written but

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,559
eventually write everything down in

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,440
smaller tasks and sub tasks and minimal

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,480
goals and

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,159
you know all those things um the more

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,760
you define what you want to succeed the

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,799
easier it's going to be for you to

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,159
succeed it

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,640
so again have like a plan on your mind

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,679
like have a very very very specific plan

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,159
in your mind

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,960
for me that plan was to find a

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,440
javascript

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
job but for you maybe it's something

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,400
different

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,440
uh maybe it's like i want to get a

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
promotion

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,480
okay how am i going to get that

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,640
promotion

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,919
do i need to learn something new to

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,400
impress my boss

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,640
do i need to do another project do i

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,480
need to get better at time management

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,000
what exactly is that thing that it's

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,200
going to help me

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,159
to get that promotion like always

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,640
work on the small things that eventually

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,919
will

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,039
build up some other things that again

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,080
they can help you

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,279
is the keystone habits which leads to

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,679
the development of

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,440
multiple good habits so if you see

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,679
something that works

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,480
you will not break it if you see for

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,440
example that

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,960
uh diet is good for you and you see that

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,279
you're losing some weight

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,240
then maybe you will think okay i will

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,480
continue that

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,000
and not only that maybe i will start

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,720
also working out

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,320
so we'll also see more uh results on

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,279
myself

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,760
make that habit so small that you cannot

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,240
like

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,080
forget about it or deny it or say that i

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,120
won't have the time to do that

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,120
make it so small that you cannot say no

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,039
now something that a lot of people will

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,600
say is that

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,159
okay yes i'll tell you all those things

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,960
that you say

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,120
are nice but i don't have the time to do

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,360
these things

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,880
no my friends you are wrong we all have

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,000
24 hours but the way that we are using

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,279
those hours

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,240
may be different so i hope that i can

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:35,360
help you with that as well

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,240
claim back the time like be

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,000
ruthless about what you want to do be

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,919
very very specific

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,679
about what you want to do and about what

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,720
you want to learn and how

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,520
you will achieve that uh

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,320
change only one or two things at a time

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,440
so don't

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,679
try to do everything simultaneously uh

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,080
this is also why new year's resolutions

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,320
don't

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,679
work because you will write down a lot

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,919
of things

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,080
and eventually you will forget about

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,240
them so just stick to one

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,200
or two things at a time and have them

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,440
somewhere written

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,320
in front of you all the time i'm not

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,640
kidding just

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,400
do it and you will see the progress

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,960
eventually

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,080
start from something small that that it

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,240
can't go wrong

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,600
and have a minimum standard and from

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,760
there you can always

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,000
build on like for example say every

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,679
night i will wash the dishes like every

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,159
night for five or ten minutes

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,720
i will do the chores like do something

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,120
which

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,840
even if it's so small you will feel

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,039
uncomplex

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,400
because you did something

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,400
and now something else which about

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,760
um is about time and hopefully it can

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,480
help you is

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,360
doing two top two opposite things at a

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,840
time

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,240
so maybe you want to learn a lot of

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,600
things but

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:59,840
try learning two opposite things if you

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:03,120
want to be like a developer don't go for

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,120
let's say javascript and

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,360
python because these are two similar

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,440
things and if you are a beginner your

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,480
mind can't process those little

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,400
differences

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,880
but go for a python and

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,720
i don't know java which are two

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
completely different things and your

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,440
process and your mind can

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,320
process those differences or uh

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,960
about like playing the guitar and

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,120
learning

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,399
or studying mods these are again like

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,360
two opposite things

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,039
that your mind can adjust better

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,159
something else

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,640
uh that it has to do with time again

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,640
is some time concepts like the pomodoro

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,600
technique it's something that i use all

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,360
the time

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,679
if you're not familiar with the pomodoro

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,600
technique it basically says that you

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,840
set up a timer for 20 or 25 minutes

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,039
and you're super concentrated on that

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,880
time slot

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,279
you will not touch your phone you will

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,520
not are brazen in the internet

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,720
and then you will take only like five

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,679
minutes

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,120
as a break and you will continue with 20

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,200
or 25 minutes

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,080
and eventually you will repeat this

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,919
pattern as many times as you can

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,000
and the other thing is the pareto's

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,279
principle which in the pareton's

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,360
principle it says that

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:26,559
80 of your output

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,840
is coming from 20 of your

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,720
input this is really really important

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,120
because it helps you understand where

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,480
your

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,480
focus should be

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,840
okay and now another quote that i really

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,080
like that it has to do

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,919
with consistency over quality that we've

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,159
already talked a little bit about

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,840
it's part of courage is simply

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,080
consistency

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,600
if you think that something is working

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,559
why would you

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,640
stop doing it if you see that learning

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,640
that doing projects that

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,760
logging everything on github is

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,039
something positive

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,559
why would you ever stop it just continue

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,000
doing it

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,480
and some

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,640
some tips that again may help you and

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,720
they for sure have helped me

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,159
that are not very clear i mean not a lot

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,520
of people are talking about

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,799
uh them is keeping a

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,039
not to-do list so i know a lot of people

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,200
have mentioned before keep a to-do list

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,399
i have also mentioned that but what

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,159
about keeping a

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:36,240
note to-do list why is this important

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,720
well it's freaking important because

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,799
having in a in a paper like in front of

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,120
you the things that you shouldn't do

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,600
will again help you not doing these

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,240
things so it can be something like i

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,960
will not eat ice cream at 11 in the

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,159
evening

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,000
i will not watch tv for more than one

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,279
hour per day

00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,240
or like i will not leave the dishes on

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,640
washed in the evening always have that

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,520
not

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,559
to-do list in front of you and it will

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,559
help you

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,080
to focus on the things that are more

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,399
important for you

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,120
so the second thing is like analyzing

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:16,000
your day and the activities that you do

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,080
track your time and be as we said like

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,919
really ruthless

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,120
if you write down everything that you do

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,039
inside the day

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,799
it will take you some time to write

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,679
everything down because we want all the

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,640
details

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,000
but you will see some things that maybe

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,640
you hadn't noticed

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,679
that are taking your time but they are

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,799
not really

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,559
worth your time time is the most like

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,480
precious thing that we have

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:47,760
to really be careful about how you

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,600
manage your time and

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,799
the third thing is that if you don't

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,399
have something

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:57,039
imitated what i mean by that is like

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,679
uh let me give you an example if you

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,880
want to

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:04,000
improve your english maybe you're not an

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,960
english native speaker you could go to a

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,519
discord channel

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,480
you could go to different like sorry a

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,240
discord server

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,159
or you could go to different channels

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,159
and five and find people that

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,919
talk english and try to communicate with

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,039
them because maybe you don't have people

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,159
in real life

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,120
that they are talking english so this is

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,159
something that you can

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,120
imitate other thing is other example is

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,840
if you

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,480
i don't have like any friend that is

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,240
coding

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,799
so maybe you want some motivation from

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,440
your friend again you can go online you

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,600
can find

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,880
so many people that are coding you can

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,679
find them

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,120
on twitter on linkedin on different

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,200
servers and channels

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,120
and try to have like a conversation with

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,080
them so even if you don't have someone

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,080
in real life

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,640
again you can find someone over the

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,640
internet

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,320
okay and uh another quote that's coming

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,720
from steve jobs and again like i really

00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,640
like

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,720
it says great things in business are

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,080
never done by one person

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,080
they are done by thereby a team of

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,600
people they are done by a team of people

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,360
this is about community and

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,600
accountability

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,000
if you have a goal make it public

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,720
you may be afraid of doing that okay i

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,679
get it but

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,320
if you do something public then you will

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,000
afraid

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:27,200
what will happen if i fail and this

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,240
small like fear will eventually help you

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,600
to keep going

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:35,279
and keep pushing connect with people

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,880
not because you have to but because you

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,919
want to

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,080
and don't ignore people or situation

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,360
don't say i will go to that meet up the

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,320
next time or i will

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,640
log into that event the next time don't

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,640
uh

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,679
wait for the next day don't say i will

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,320
talk to that girl

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,960
the next day or to that boy the next

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,080
evening

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,440
just start doing things

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,600
now and

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,440
the last uh the last part of this

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,799
session is about dealing with

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,880
frustration and stress because i mean

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,200
it's a situation that we've all been

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,320
there

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,480
again a quote that i really like it says

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,919
it's not the strongest of the pieces

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,799
that survive

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,360
not the most intelligent but the one

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,720
most

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,200
responsive to chains so the key word

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,880
here

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,880
is responsive

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,399
dealing with dealing with problems at

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,320
your workspace

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,279
so maybe you have problems with your

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,799
colleagues or with work itself

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,880
like what will you do in those

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,360
situations

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,240
try to learn if it's only you is it only

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,640
you that you have

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,240
those problems with your colleagues or

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,720
your boss

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,720
talk to someone if you're afraid to talk

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,720
with someone that it's already

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,840
at the same position as you or at the

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,240
same work as you

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,440
maybe you can find like ex colleagues

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,120
through linkedin

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:08,560
and try to chat with them as well

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,720
but like leave toxic places at any cost

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,040
if you see that something is not working

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,879
like leave that place immediately it

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,079
doesn't worth it every single day

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,240
counts now some other

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,159
thing is that people sometimes they

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,520
afraid that they are not like smart

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,320
enough

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,639
but uh something again that may help you

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,040
is

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,919
learning how other people starting their

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,560
careers

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,079
and so far like i told you my career how

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,200
it started

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,000
i know that coding is hard and it's

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,119
complex

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,879
and uh like yeah if it was is like

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,079
everyone would do it

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,399
don't compare yourself to others and

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,440
like learn that like you have to know

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,000
that in your first

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,879
job maybe they will not take you because

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,079
you are that

00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:00,079
amazing um coder maybe they will take

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,320
you because you have other skills like

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,079
you are good in communication

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,520
maybe you're good at understanding

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,680
things maybe you have humor

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,599
maybe i don't know maybe they just like

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,839
you and they want to hire you so it's

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,880
not always about the hard skills

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:20,160
but the soft skills play a big role too

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,119
now what about dealing with

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,960
learning and how to speed up their

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,400
learning process well there are some

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,960
things that you can do

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
these are like building projects and

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,400
don't watch

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,240
only tutorials but actually building

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,640
things yourself

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,160
and try to have like an updated

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,079
portfolio

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,160
some other things that they can help you

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,040
is creating a sustainable plan

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,200
and working on that planning light each

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,119
and every single day

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,240
don't be afraid to put yourself out

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,560
there so

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,040
try to write articles maybe record

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,440
yourself and upload videos on youtube

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,400
tweet about your progress and use social

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,680
media

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,400
in your advance and another small tip

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,720
here is

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,680
when you're watching podcasts or video

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,000
tutorials

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,920
you could like have the speed on one at

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,320
a time or 1.5

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,119
so you will watch or listen to something

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,200
faster

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:20,480
and eventually you will learn faster

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:25,280
and last but not least it's about

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,280
dealing with yourself

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,560
sometimes people are too hard with

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,680
themselves

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,960
don't judge your self too

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,480
hard it's okay to fail everyone fails

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,359
and it's okay to change

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,000
your goals from time to time take a

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,920
break

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,200
but then come up and come stronger

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,960
you have that don't forget

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:54,720
to take a break as i said like eat good

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,800
work out do showers and uh

00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,440
sleep like eight hours or so

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,839
okay guys so that was by me i hope that
