Description: 
	Under-the-hood of type systems (e.g. TypeScript) // Craig Taub
This talk was presented live at JS Monthly, to see the Q&A you can view the original live-stream: https://youtu.be/OArbAGhVIF4

This talk aims to shine a light on some of the fundamentals at work under-the-hood for type systems such as TypeScript or Flow. It is not possible to focus on everything in 1 article so here we will be looking at "type checks" specifically.

Starting with an overview of type systems then building our own compiler which can run type checks and output sensible messages.
