Title: A Thousand Words: How I'm Still Not Using GUIs in 2019 - JS Monthly - October 2019
Publication date: 2019-11-17
Playlist: JS Monthly London
Description: 
	I prepare for a talk for months. I prepare slides for weeks, rehearse for days, and practice live-coding for hours. But when I open the terminal and start using vIM is the moment I can clearly see peoples eyes sparkling and their hearts being filled with joy.

This is not because I edit text precisely or jump through views swiftly, this is because plain-text is elegant. It’s because people didn’t know plain-text was so powerful.

In this talk, I want to explore UNIX philosophy and go into its deepest roots to explain why plain-text is so powerful and how we can use this power not only in our job but also whenever we’re talking to machines. I want to turn these often daunting concepts into simple and practical ideas.

Communicating with the computer in its own language makes it easier for us to understand what it is saying and tell it what it should do in a clear way.

I don’t think we should abandon all graphical interfaces for software engineering, far from that. What I want to show is that they are not always the best tool for the job.

After this talk, I guarantee you will never see your terminal with the same eyes, nor write code the same way.

I work a start-up which is quite close

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,710
here we call converge you can follow me

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,469
on Twitter at the wizard Lucas or

00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,910
Twitter angry things about me know using

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,190
Emacs

00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,809
so I came to JavaScript app to talk

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,359
about how I'm basically now using

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,430
anything written in JavaScript to write

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:25,050
JavaScript and house you know using Jew

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,880
eyes in 2019 so the stock comes from a

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,609
blog post have written a few months ago

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,960
called house you know using G Weiss in

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:36,630
2019 maybe someone here has seen it okay

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,079
everyone here is their hands awesome

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:43,170
so since I have written this I really

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,000
wanted to do a talk to explain to you of

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,280
the most common questions to two of the

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,510
most common questions I get when I tell

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,489
this to people and transfer some of the

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:56,520
emails I got in a more public fashion so

00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:58,140
these questions are why and how there's

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,539
also a third question which is a bit

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:06,030
more like oh my god why this is the most

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,590
common by the way and this is the one I

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,390
would like to start with because you

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,130
know it might sound weird for someone to

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,740
come here and say like oh you know don't

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,180
use you eyes and just use this this way

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,500
of developing software that comes from

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,500
my donor day eighty s 70s or 95 I really

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,320
don't know especially because you know

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,939
we've got so many amazing GU eyes these

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,710
days everyone loves that right I mean

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:37,920
look at how many buttons you have to

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,810
click fantastic so it's kind of like it

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,210
can imagine when someone came up with

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,149
books and then people in magic for

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,860
saying like you know actually papyrus is

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,909
a very good idea you know we shouldn't

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,950
shouldn't move forward and you know you

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,640
might think oh no one will say that you

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,920
know no way when I comes Hawking user

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,920
clock the time of the talk where I read

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,159
my favorite comments from that boat pose

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,610
or Hockney's and I just like to start

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,679
with my favorite one in which someone

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,470
quotes a passage from the text which

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,970
says

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,680
using a terminal at least makes a

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,730
proficient with the lowest common

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,989
denominator of tools okay so everything

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,579
is this is not supposed to be a joke but

00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,450
it's good that you're laughing that

00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:30,540
makes me happy the real joke comes now

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:35,430
so then they go on to ask why even use a

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:38,030
computer then I mean aren't rocks and

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,939
sticks and even lower common denominator

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:46,609
and then there's someone else that made

00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:49,019
a great analogy this is in StarCraft

00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:53,370
very few developers are limited by their

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:55,889
APM tribute to DUI okay fine and then a

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,970
very how can you comment a very hardcore

00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:02,639
one even your terminal emulator is a GUI

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,590
app itself don't say you're now using a

00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:11,730
gy up unless you boot up command-line

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:15,750
interface directly come on I mean it is

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:19,590
sky Ignace true right but I got some

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,549
street cred I got a vent at sea not that

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,049
bad right

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,079
I might not boot a command-line

00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:28,699
interface directly me know this is kind

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:31,049
of good sorry

00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:32,579
yeah I mean that's why I had to learn

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,620
you know I couldn't quit so I just I

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:39,419
mean I couldn't be fired

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,979
I had to write some code so now let me

00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,540
sort of heartache alert and actually

00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:47,099
start with the real corner of the stock

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,540
and say that GOI SAR bloatware luckily I

00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,889
have time enough to make this a more

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,599
nuanced argument so actually I think

00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:56,269
that you eyes are blow-dry but I don't

00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,769
think they're both way because

00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,870
decorators decide to make them Lauder I

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,549
think that Walter because of the very

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,859
nature of GUIs

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,629
because it's very very hard to develop a

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,129
GUI right because when you're developing

00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,019
at UI because it's so hard to integrate

00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,930
with other programs because you have to

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,150
worry about every single thing that your

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,419
user is gonna do you need to build in

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,489
all those features and that causes GUI

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,919
Sui bolter because they need to know too

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,229
much about who's gonna use them and how

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,139
they're gonna use them because they

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,789
cannot communicate

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:31,180
like old-school Microsoft programs right

00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:33,069
as long Mac you I said like Word Excel

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,379
PowerPoint and our Microsoft programs

00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:37,479
have intimate one might say promiscuous

00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:40,389
knowledge of each other's internals in

00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,039
UNIX one tries to design programs to

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,180
pray not specifically with each other

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:49,419
but with programs as yet and thought of

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,830
so we do this we are able to do this in

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,150
your necks and UNIX possibly because we

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,819
have a university interface which makes

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,469
it very easy for programs to communicate

00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:58,960
and we use it we should write programs

00:04:56,469 --> 00:05:00,789
to help text streams because that is the

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,229
universal interface and because you have

00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:04,389
the university interface itself trying

00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:05,889
to building all those features instead

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,199
of trying to think of all that in

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,580
advance you build a small programs

00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,590
because they can communicate you can let

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,860
that to your users especially because

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,569
we're talking about engineering

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,610
so you worry about writing programs that

00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:20,069
do one thing and that do it well

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,449
instead of making programs that do

00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,129
everything especially because they can

00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,169
communicate because we have this very

00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:28,689
well-defined is very elegant and simple

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:30,849
interface for them to communicate we

00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:33,370
worry more about watching problems that

00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:34,930
work together instead of making a big

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,569
program that tries to do everything on

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,339
its own

00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,949
so most UI is actually meaningless

00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,899
software and less software is good right

00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:46,330
let's offer means less time fixing

00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:48,819
things less time debugging things less

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,099
time thinking about them right less

00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:52,509
software is very good I want to live in

00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:55,599
a world with less offer I mean I know

00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:57,069
that's our job right but the thing is

00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:59,860
there's only one thing better than less

00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:03,699
suffer and the only thing that's better

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:06,250
less software is no software all right I

00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:08,289
mean the more you can get AK you can

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,909
accomplish with the lease code I mean

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,589
that's efficiency right you're not paid

00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:13,659
to write code you're paid to solve

00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:17,219
problems problems you pay to generate

00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:19,839
value right so let's software is good

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:23,110
so G why is what do you is are limiting

00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,509
as we seen so in the same way that the

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,649
creators of G you eyes have to think of

00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,529
everything that you're going to do in

00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:31,089
advance you need you also you're also

00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:33,069
limited by what they thought in advance

00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:35,080
but if they didn't think of something

00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:38,950
you might want to do well you're going

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,770
to have a very very hard time doing it

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,930
they're also not scalable so the more

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,880
you do things on a GUI well you don't

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,440
get significantly better yet not even

00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,180
talking about scalability in terms of

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,130
like performance I'm talking about

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,890
scalability of terms of in terms of you

00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:57,190
doing tasks better using task squeeker

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,810
or you doing tasks with less effort so

00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,030
when you get to CLI you can always find

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,920
out about new options or if you already

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,870
know a certain tool you can just store a

00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,730
few options or tow it in a certain way

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,380
or combine it with tools you already

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,270
know because I already know those

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,880
comments because you use them very often

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:16,390
and therefore it skills better with your

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,630
skills so if you have some water by the

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:22,030
way because I'm really oh thank you very

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:25,630
much because I I was sick this weekend

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:28,150
sir well they're also very hard to

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,550
integrate because you know have you ever

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,100
tried to you know get the output of the

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,970
GUI and put in an hour program isn't it

00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,740
very annoying

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,080
you have to like sport it to a file or

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,760
like I don't copy it somehow you know

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,290
find a way of doing it it's not it's

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,030
just not native it's very hard to make

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,290
these programs talk to each other which

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,580
is the very reason why they're bloated

00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:50,380
as we've seen they're also hard to

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,750
automate right I mean if we're going to

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,880
write a script I mean you're using CLI

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,560
just just use them you know just it's

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,220
just easier and because you're doing

00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,600
that already

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,700
it's very easy to port whatever

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,920
environment you need it's very easy to

00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,540
migrate that - I don't know - see I

00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,770
pipeline or if you're using someone

00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,960
else's machine like if you're pairing

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:13,590
with someone right and they use a text

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:16,000
editor you don't like OOP so basically

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,450
what you can do is you can just open a

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,960
terminal

00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:21,760
our cig yeah so you can just open a

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,400
terminal fire up them and do whatever

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:30,310
you need to do or Emacs I mean it's fine

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:33,370
so basically that's those are the

00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,750
reasons why I don't like GU ice but

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,550
there are things that you guys are good

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,770
for right I'm not saying that you should

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:43,599
use Photoshop you know as a CLI or

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:45,070
anything like that I if you tried that's

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,630
fine I don't think it was a very nice

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,690
experience you know too many Fillion

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,930
images using text you know you should

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:55,390
use a GUI when you need a GUI right

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:58,320
we need to use Photoshop you know that's

00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:02,050
not what I look advocating for here okay

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,980
so GUI is a good for tasks such as

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,710
discoverability

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:09,370
for no repetitive tasks and forging with

00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:12,400
multimedia right so these things they're

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:14,050
not always things we need right in like

00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,280
to be honest there are things we need

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,570
like you know not not very often

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,030
discoverability do we really need to be

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,640
exploring menus and finding out what we

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,770
want to do with a certain a certain

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,320
piece of code or something like dragging

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:31,300
sliders or I don't know manipulating

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,600
things somehow there's not something we

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,640
do very often right no repetitive tasks

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,890
now you might think oh but I automate

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,050
everything right but also for you to

00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:43,630
automate everything you probably need

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:46,060
try to script don't you and maybe your

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,350
tests are not repetitive and intent

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,380
maybe you're always doing a different

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,210
thing but the nature of the task is the

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,310
same everyone needs to convert files

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,470
move files here move files there you

00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,050
know replace a certain bit of tax or

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,980
change I Denari like the format of tax

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:05,140
source or things like that so maybe if

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,120
you use the CLI we would define ways to

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,410
do those tasks using that same tool like

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,530
just toggling a few options are

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:13,210
combining it with tools your idea and

00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,620
okay this one is fair enough I mean if

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,300
you're front-end developer especially

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,670
because you know you know JavaScript up

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,360
I do use a browser I use Vimeo multi

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,230
browser though but yeah this this is

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,420
fair enough I don't think I need to

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:29,710
explain that you know if you need to use

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:32,500
Photoshop just use Photoshop so now I

00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:35,350
think I can safely say that you either

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,080
bloatware for what we do as engineers

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,150
most of the time right not saying that

00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,150
all you guys have water I'm saying that

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:47,020
some do I serve water for some of the

00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:49,030
things that we do very frequently so

00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,500
this is actually a question which is

00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,360
more about language which is more about

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,000
the symbols we share and how we share

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,980
them you know like in Photoshop it makes

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,290
sense to use UI because you're dealing

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,390
with visual abstractions right that's

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,630
the language that the program is talking

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,520
to you with right so you do need sliders

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,800
you need to see things happening in each

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,300
you have that discoverability right you

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,640
need to be able to play with things in

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,250
the same language as a software selling

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,010
it Wow if you're talking to I don't know

00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,780
if you are writing code it's easier to

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,080
communicate in a structured text

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,090
language it's just about the symbols you

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:29,500
share with the problem domain that

00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:32,020
you're manipulating so this is really

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,490
more of a communication problem than a

00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,990
technology problem and language is

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,660
something very difficult to get right

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,040
you know as Marcel Duchamp said as soon

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,120
as we start putting our thoughts into

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,400
words and sentences

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,290
everything gets distorted language is

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,050
just no good I use it because I have to

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,900
but I don't put any trust in it we never

00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,420
understand each other every conversion

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,190
is kind of lossy right so if you choose

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,510
the wrong abstraction you lose even more

00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,980
information and it gets harder to

00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:02,440
communicate so in fact this is all about

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,720
speaking the same language it's more

00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,030
about shared abstractions about more

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
precise vocabulary and about making

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,260
things less magic and that's my problem

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,020
ideas you know you press buttons and too

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,720
many things happen and when things go

00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,280
wrong usually get a terminal output so

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,720
if you're already used to that it makes

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,580
a lot it makes things are easier to

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,140
debug because you know what's happening

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,970
in the background all right there's no

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,830
magic you you know what's happening

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,270
behind hood and once you know that it's

00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,800
fine to automate things you know it's

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,110
it's actually you should automate things

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,940
but you should be conscious of what's

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,410
happening so that you can debug it and

00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,880
so that you can understand what your

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,220
machine is telling you if you always

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,170
like dealing with images and buttons you

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,650
lose part of the context part of the

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:49,120
meaning and makes things less like

00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:52,840
harder to understand and now how so how

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,310
do I do it well I use a bunch of tools

00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,150
these are the three main ones I

00:12:54,310 --> 00:13:02,680
recommend for anyone starting out so

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:06,550
sorry so I will start with Josh or that

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:10,990
she'll or whatever you call it so that

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:13,600
she'll is just a shell but okay what

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,780
what is the show well not the shell

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,700
right this shell so a shell is just a

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,089
user interface for you to communicate

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,519
with your operating systems

00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:25,309
program but a shell is nothing but

00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:29,269
program right bash is a program si is a

00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:31,759
program that shows a program fish is the

00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:33,529
thing with also program so all of these

00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,980
they're just programs for you to inter

00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:38,689
interact with your machine and it's very

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,430
important to differentiate what this is

00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:43,550
from what the terminal military is and

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,990
what the terminal is so in that post

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,329
someone also said you know

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:50,839
oh you're now using a real terminal are

00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:55,959
you like yeah you know you know they I

00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:58,040
couldn't be born before 95 and sorry so

00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,329
basically the terminal is the real thing

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,459
the real term know where you go and type

00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:04,519
things there is a terminal emulator

00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:07,730
which emulates the real thing which is

00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,439
the thing is by the way I use item I've

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,230
heard that the the nature of Mac

00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:15,019
terminal is quite good so I've been

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,470
thinking about switching maybe that's a

00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,660
good idea

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,809
maybe really need one less - that's

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:24,709
great and then there's a shell which is

00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:26,329
that shell so basically that shell runs

00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:30,019
inside terminal emulator which emulates

00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:33,410
the real thing and this is kind of how

00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:35,029
it works so basically what happens is

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,730
your keyboard provides input simulator

00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:40,459
and it gives feedback to your monitor

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,019
and your emulator communicates with

00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:45,410
programs through something we call the

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:47,929
tty driver which I'm not going to detail

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,999
here basically those I always you see

00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:52,939
there they're just streams passing data

00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:54,860
back and forth the sender output simply

00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:56,809
our standard input I've written a whole

00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,660
blog post about this going in quite a

00:14:56,809 --> 00:15:01,579
lot of detail so if you want to know

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,939
more just go in with that that's like

00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:09,079
very very very very long which is why

00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:13,279
I'm not gonna do this to you tonight no

00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:15,259
ace you're welcome okay but why do I use

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,610
that show well you can just try using SH

00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:17,929
and you know you can feel the difference

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,300
I think it's going to be quite painful I

00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:22,429
don't recommend I notice that is quite

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,889
nice I quite like the automation

00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:26,769
features there is many plugins that are

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:31,220
very very useful get plugins

00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:33,770
there's also besides that especially is

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,140
that zed is a very good plugin

00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:39,440
and it's just very easy to manage your

00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:42,800
configuration is just very nice and it

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,650
is everything I need very extensible and

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,330
well there's a trick noise phrases

00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:51,440
plugin which you can pipe in two kalsa

00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,850
which is quite nice and to manage my

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,310
configuration you use all my slash which

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,260
is pretty much standard say if you just

00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,540
go on github you find plenty of

00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,190
information there we post quite good if

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,200
you have any questions not only about a

00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,810
massage about sauce as well I don't

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,730
think anyone cares so yeah if you just

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:11,090
go there it's quite a lot of resources

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:13,490
that are very very good so next thing on

00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,770
my list is team axe terminal which

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,210
flexor which is really just a fancy name

00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,950
for something that makes your windows

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,900
you know split it and gives you a bunch

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,500
of tabs and stuff there's more than that

00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,720
actually

00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,660
so team axe allows you to create

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,220
sessions and you can attach or detach to

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,290
those sessions because it keeps just a

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,880
server running with dual sessions so

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,070
basically I do is like if I'm going to

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,930
work I have a session for work then I go

00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,270
to home I detach from that session and

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,650
my terminal goes completely blank and I

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,530
can create a new session forever I'm

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,790
working with at home or if I'm at our

00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,010
new blog post I'll just start a new

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,350
session and I can just switch from

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:51,440
context to context by detaching and

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,540
attaching to sessions so this is how it

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,770
works this is a very basic overview so

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,930
there's a server which keeps those

00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,670
sessions always running it also keeps

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,650
the layout of your pains your windows

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:03,470
like everything stays exactly the same

00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:05,360
so when you detach it's like it's gone

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:09,410
for a terminal but it's su exists

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,720
somewhere you know somewhere so

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,100
basically those sessions are stored in

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,370
the server so you can attach and detach

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,920
from them and then there's paints which

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:21,680
are just like tabs which keeps your

00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,330
windows which actually contains the

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:29,210
instances of the shop which is running

00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:31,340
so these are a bunch of T MUX plugins

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,520
that I use not going to go over all of

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,980
them again you're welcome

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,450
I do recommend to MUX retract into MUX

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,320
continue just to persist your sessions

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,590
and make sure you're not going to lose

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,510
them and just you know add the other

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,400
ones are mostly for making things pretty

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,510
and impressing your friends the teamwork

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,180
Spotify one is quite

00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,920
it because you can know what's playing

00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:55,250
why we write code which is very very

00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,780
useful sometimes there's also a

00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,940
command-line interface for Spotify which

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,880
I kind like kind of like is very nice

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:07,460
and then there's them you know you have

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:10,040
them users here today nice nice so them

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,900
is my text editor of choice it's harder

00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,720
because it's different but it's also

00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,180
better because it's different I actually

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,390
don't use vim I use nvm which is just a

00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,560
continuation extension of them mostly

00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,740
because it has better support for

00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:27,890
synchronous tasks which I heard them H I

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,560
think has but I haven't tried out yet so

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,760
basically what would happen before this

00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,680
I would say Oh file on them

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,050
syntax checks would run type checks

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,790
would run things would just like stop

00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,560
working for a while they just freeze and

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,900
that's because it was running everything

00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,080
on a single thread so what an event that

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,100
doesn't happen anymore which is why nice

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,010
there's also a better alternative for

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,560
scripts which if you have ever tried to

00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:55,240
write something in VML you know it's

00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:59,030
very painful so that's much much better

00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,220
and you know my say ah you know that

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,390
doesn't matter right well I think it

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,920
actually matters because it's not about

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,840
writing code fast and now you might

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,130
argue you know I'm most of the time

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,340
thinking I'm not most of the time

00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,810
writing code well the thing is you you

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,400
always have to keep those thoughts in

00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,680
your head while you're writing one so

00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,140
the quicker you can write your thoughts

00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,820
the better right if you it's about

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,530
writing thoughts faster faster it's

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,700
about taking those things out of your

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,880
head and putting them now as soon as

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,970
possible so that you can keep code as

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,130
close your ideas as possible it's about

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,590
reducing drudgery because editing code

00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,450
is you know it's not your main goal

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,860
right I mean your mango is thinking and

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,560
solving the problem putting that down

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:42,350
you want to spend you don't have more

00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:45,200
time for to think and less time to

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,130
actually type so if you have something

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,230
that allows you to do things very

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,880
quickly which allows it try to make lots

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,010
of tasks which allows you to customize

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,720
your workflow talk to - so that you can

00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:56,570
spend more time thinking that's all

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,520
better and it's also about not using a

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,320
mouse you know it's more economic it's

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,980
very very nice to be able to type and

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,540
have everything

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,610
you know the reach of your fingers it

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,290
just makes you very very fast and you

00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,800
know it's Pleasant it makes me happy as

00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:11,510
a developer so a few tips to become a

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,780
pro you know it takes actually takes

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:18,770
time you know I've been doing it for

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:21,080
four years and you know I'm quite quick

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,450
but you know every single day I discover

00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,150
something you like really you never stop

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,550
learning new things it's just amazing so

00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,640
the first step is vim tutor so this is

00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,600
one is this one's quite basic so

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,750
whenever you have some free time like

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,390
10-15 minutes just type in vim tutor and

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,710
you have some text you can add it which

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,480
is going to have instructions for you

00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,310
tread it using them so basically it's

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,070
going to open a text file in them and

00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:49,670
this text file says here's how you do

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:53,330
things and then you do things and it's

00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:57,230
very very helpful next step is to do

00:20:53,330 --> 00:21:00,890
things of my and by this I mean disable

00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:02,450
your arrow keys okay not not even insert

00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,640
mode that's the first thing I've done

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,560
when I sold them a friend of mine said

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,260
if you use arrow keys you're never going

00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,570
to learn and then the first thing I did

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,900
was to disable arrow keys in any mode

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,490
possible and I learned so I guess it

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,200
worked

00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,630
so do you say borrow keys you know

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,090
disabled support for the mouse do things

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,860
how them wants you to do things I'd

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,660
learned the entry patterns if you're

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,240
pressing a key more than twice in them

00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,390
you're doing something wrong there's a

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,580
better way to do it more than twice

00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,610
wrong imagine me screaming your head

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:41,480
more than twice

00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:43,730
don't do it ass go over nail I don't try

00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,470
too many plugins so this is this is a

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:49,010
lot this very relationship to the

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,510
previous topic so then most of times

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,510
people install plugins to do things that

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:55,070
vim can do so you just you know you're

00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,390
just adding bullroar to U of M really

00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,240
and you know that's the thing we're

00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:01,370
fighting yes right we don't really want

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,740
to make via an ID we just want to make

00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,120
them better for what we use so we can

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,310
customize it and it's very good to have

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,080
plugins I do use plugins but I just

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:11,540
don't use so many I try to go as vanilla

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,770
as possible and learn how them wants me

00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,840
to do things you know how to use

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,610
banes how to use how to set

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,020
configuration slides myself so that when

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,210
I'm in another machine I can do things

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,780
properly and everything so just go over

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:26,070
now don't try too many plugins at first

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:29,670
they're always ask yourself there's a

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:38,130
better way to do things because secret

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:41,040
and then always okay and then resist the

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:44,429
urge to quit which is very easy because

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,820
no one can do it anyway right but I'm

00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:51,059
gonna teach you right okay the question

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,770
you are all waiting for you know this is

00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:58,800
the answer you wanted and this is I'm

00:22:52,770 --> 00:23:01,800
gonna give you good no one will be

00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:05,940
trapped hopefully you know use this

00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:09,570
command hopefully you won't now wait

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:12,390
yeah don't don't spoil the talk come on

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,429
because you know when things don't work

00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,730
you do whatever you do one things that

00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:19,110
work you scream with them and then

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:23,429
eventually they work you know just

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:24,600
append this the symbol to next set and

00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:26,190
this is because vim is your friend right

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,090
when you type something in then we'll

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:32,610
say don't wait you can do this you're

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,770
gonna you're gonna lose your word you

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,900
know Vivian is like your friend you

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,750
saying like yeah this is what Vincent he

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,809
was telling you no no you're gonna lose

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,790
this be careful and then you know you

00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:46,770
might decide to screen with them read of

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:50,010
him was just trying to be your friend

00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:53,880
remember this them always wants to be a

00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:57,780
friend so a few of the plugins II's so I

00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,400
do use Nair tree I like it not really

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,750
for manipulating Facebook because the

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,790
visual structure of files and how

00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,130
they're an asset helps me a lot to

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:08,370
understand how the pro the project is

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:10,830
set up I use fzf which is very good for

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:13,770
finding files I used to use ctrl P but

00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:15,090
that's just to slur and also fzf is very

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,980
nice because it allows you to choose

00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,710
which file finder you're going to use

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,179
behind a hood so I tend to use AG with

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,970
it which is super fast and let us talk

00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:26,250
about in a bit are using match because I

00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,600
write quite a lot of markup so that

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:33,650
makes me quite

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:36,690
I use L this is not alcohol-related

00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:39,200
this means a synchronously inter engine

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,550
which is a lot less exciting and sorry

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,650
it basically allows you to have one

00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:45,179
single plug-in for linking for

00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:49,230
formatting so basically if you using

00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:51,900
javascript for example you can just say

00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:53,520
oh just use my yes and configs and just

00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,690
use preacher to format my files and you

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,700
don't need to be installing like a

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,910
plugin for picture playing for yes lint

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:03,030
or whatever using then there's an you

00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:05,490
make which is just like Meg but a

00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,080
synchronous for new of them so that you

00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,090
can have your test flight type checking

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,210
like syntax tracking running

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:14,250
synchronously and via monfriez and then

00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,210
you just use your language specific

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,460
plugins you know if you're using

00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,140
javascript to download javascript

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,170
plugins if using go do download go

00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,990
plugins if using PHP I'm sorry no just

00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:27,179
kidding

00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:30,330
you know just use plugins for whatever

00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:33,929
language using and then some general

00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:36,929
tips and references so what files you

00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:38,730
know be very gentle to them like keep

00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:41,190
them in a nice shape publish centric

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:43,710
github and also keep an eye on other

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,570
people's dot files you will learn a lot

00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,320
about how people do things how they like

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:51,690
to work in about the workflow in general

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,670
try to do more using less so don't you

00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:56,220
know don't try to use too many tools

00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:59,429
like try to learn the tools you you

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,990
already have try to optimize for using

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,059
as few tools as possible in the best way

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,470
possible

00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:05,400
many won't trigger a time you know this

00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,370
these things take time

00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:12,960
and when you start out you will want to

00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:15,510
quit now you know how but you know it

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,030
does take time so if you stick to it if

00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,710
you devote a bit of time every day I'm

00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:23,040
sure things will be easier and hopefully

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:25,110
quite nice automate everything I don't

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,470
think I need to explain this one do I

00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:31,020
then another quite nice tip that I've

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,120
seen this day so how can users do

00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,650
nothing scripts so basically there are

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,030
scripts you just print what you have to

00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:39,750
do the terminal and you do it manually

00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:40,980
so you can automate them gradually you

00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,600
have repetitive

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,299
that you always know like oh what's the

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,650
next step and if something is easy to

00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,970
automate you just go and automate it

00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,710
straight away and you know what you need

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,030
to automate and the very nice thing

00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,350
about them is because you know how many

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,450
times you're in comments on terminals

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,799
you can just see a count of how many

00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,450
times you're doing certain tasks and you

00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:00,299
know like oh this task is more available

00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,679
for me to automate and you know learn

00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:03,150
the fundamentals you know learn about

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,730
shrimps learn your way around the

00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,020
terminal you know learn how to use sad

00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,830
sad is nice said these are friend

00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:12,150
regular expressions so nice so you know

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,650
just a few things that you should learn

00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,320
you know learn how to anyplace trims

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,600
said as I've said or said said it's like

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,890
so nice really really really big fellow

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,390
said AG so you can find files super

00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,630
super quick with Ag I think it stands

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,690
for the C researcher I think this is the

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,940
symbol for silver and the table of

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:36,090
elements I know I'm not pretty sure but

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,950
there's a wk basically you can just

00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:40,410
speak whatever information needing those

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,669
columns and pass it in a very nice way

00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:44,910
to whatever program you're going to

00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:47,429
manipulate them with curl which is very

00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:51,690
nice in place very well with J key which

00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:53,549
allows you to manipulate JSON data so

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,460
curl and JQ play really really nice

00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:57,630
together if you have REST API froze in

00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,419
place many people raise their hands

00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,650
before make you know make has been

00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:04,710
around since forever right make this

00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:07,080
order than I am right so you know just

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,010
make allows you to do so many things you

00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,500
know there's so many open-source

00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,390
products even in JavaScript that you use

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,270
make because make is elegant make it

00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,770
simple there's also a legend I think do

00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:20,750
I have time for a legend it's just two

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:23,309
minutes so there's a legend that once

00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:26,280
okay I'm gonna be quick so once someone

00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:28,980
wrote sorry so once someone wrote a

00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,440
makefile and then all other make files

00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,940
were copied from that make file and then

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,490
we'll just set the changes so all make

00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:39,240
files have one single one single

00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,540
descendant then their scroll so just you

00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,370
know

00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,780
Chrome's also like learn how to schedule

00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,720
tasks like it's very simple so it's

00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:48,179
there it's your friend VM so you can use

00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,919
a browser without a mouse very very nice

00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:54,780
and you know just read the manual so

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,760
reading the manual is like so useful I

00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,830
no it sounds intimidating at first when

00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,590
you type you know man comment and then

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:04,020
or the huge wall of text appears in

00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,980
front of you and you're like oh god you

00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,170
know this is hard

00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,180
well once you learn how to read that and

00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:12,770
to interpret it in the correct way just

00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:15,450
makes things so much easier to learn so

00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,890
here my dad files if you want to see how

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,500
I work and how the things are very very

00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,580
minimal I try to keep them as vanilla as

00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,010
possible because I don't like to use

00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:27,110
many plugins and I like to be good to go

00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:30,000
in whatever machine I I use you know in

00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:34,830
in you know risky situation you know

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,810
from in I dunno whatever I am I can just

00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,690
get rap whatever machine and solve a

00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,130
problem it's very good there is a people

00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,780
of course I've written just go to Lucas

00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,700
f cos calm they're all there they're

00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,950
quite long but I think they're very fun

00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,110
to read there's this ball python rider

00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:52,230
which is super good which is called our

00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:55,530
mask so this guy talks a lot about

00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:58,320
terminal about tools about them about

00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:00,750
energy patterns regular expressions very

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,390
very nice things and that's pretty much

00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,820
it you can treat me yet the wizard Lucas

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:09,060
or you can follow me on github or you

00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:10,870
know just you can find me around that's

00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:17,220
pretty much it thank you

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:17,220
