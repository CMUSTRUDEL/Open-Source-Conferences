Title: A Thousand Words: How I'm Still Not Using GUIs in 2019 - JS Monthly - October 2019
Publication date: 2019-11-17
Playlist: JS Monthly London
Description: 
	I prepare for a talk for months. I prepare slides for weeks, rehearse for days, and practice live-coding for hours. But when I open the terminal and start using vIM is the moment I can clearly see peoples eyes sparkling and their hearts being filled with joy.

This is not because I edit text precisely or jump through views swiftly, this is because plain-text is elegant. It’s because people didn’t know plain-text was so powerful.

In this talk, I want to explore UNIX philosophy and go into its deepest roots to explain why plain-text is so powerful and how we can use this power not only in our job but also whenever we’re talking to machines. I want to turn these often daunting concepts into simple and practical ideas.

Communicating with the computer in its own language makes it easier for us to understand what it is saying and tell it what it should do in a clear way.

I don’t think we should abandon all graphical interfaces for software engineering, far from that. What I want to show is that they are not always the best tool for the job.

After this talk, I guarantee you will never see your terminal with the same eyes, nor write code the same way.
