	What the heck(ma) is ECMA? // Abby Mitchell

Have you ever felt confused by terms like ES5, ES6, ES2015? What is the difference? Is it all still Javascript? Why isn't it JS2015???

These are all great questions that will be answered during this talk. We'll cover a bit about the history of Javascript standards, where you can find the most up to date information, and the key syntactic differences between the most common versions.
