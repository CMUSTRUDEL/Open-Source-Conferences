Quadtree and its implementation on Maps using D3 by Gunaseelan Narayanan

Have you noticed in a World map, where markers are used to represent something? The markers when seen at the beginning appear close between two locations and when zoomed in, appear far away. If the cities are too close they can even overlap each other. It will look ugly, right? In this talk we will explore the Quadtree approach which can be used to search for geometric points in a plane accurately and instantly and how this can be used in clustering.

Guna is a Front End Developer working at JFrog India in Bangalore. He started his career with Mindtree as a Junior Engineer. He has experience in many front end frameworks and specialises in Data Viz using D3. He is an open source contributor in Billboard.js which is a JavaScript chart library, based on D3. When he is not coding he is a sports enthusiasts and a gamer. Bmedium.com/@gunaseel


Building a high performance financial web application with JavaScript by Pawel Badenski

A short summary of one team's journey to run a real-time financial calculation engine in the browser using JavaScript. Buffet üçî üçü ü•§ style (as in food, not Warren) presentation with something for everyone - React & Redux, V8 optimisations, monads and evolving simple design.

Pawel is a cofounder & CTO @ Pricing Monkey and has been a coder for nearly 15 years. Performance engineering has been one of his biggest passions in software. He got hooked many years ago when working on a Java-based airline scheduling system. Then he switched his focus to JavaScript and the world of browsers. One thing stays the same, as my former colleague said to me many years ago "Contrary to what many people think - performance engineering is hard."
