- How to prevent the collapse of society by building an accessible web by Salma Alam-Naylor

It’s 2031. Society, as we knew it in 2021, has officially collapsed. Old technology, deprecated hardware and a very slow internet connection is all we have left.

Accessibility on the web is now paramount to the survival of the human race. But how do you ensure your website is accessible amidst a raging apocalypse?

Join whitep4nth3r to explore why only the most accessible and inclusive websites will survive an apocalypse, how you can utilise free tools to ensure you are building for the apocalypse, and why all of this is more important than ever now, in 2021.

Salma helps developers build stuff, learn things and love what they do. Salma currently works as a Developer Evangelist for Contentful and you can find her building stuff and learning things live on Twitch as whitep4nth3r. You will often hear her shouting about inclusivity and accessibility.

- Records & Tuples: way more than immutability by Sébastien Lorber

Records and Tuples is a stage-2 proposal that brings deeply immutable data structures to JavaScript. But immutability is only one part of the story: their "compound primitives" behaviour could be the most interesting part, and have a way significant impact. Through different examples, we will see how to use them, and what are the benefits for frontend applications and frameworks, in particular ReactJS.

Sébastien is a ReactJS freelancer.
Lately, he works for Facebook as the lead maintainer of Docusaurus, the Jamstack open-source documentation framework used by Jest, React-Native, Relay, Redux, Babel, Prettier and many more.

He became an early adopter of ReactJS in 2014, specialized in techno, and contributed to the growth of its open-source ecosystem. He is passionate about cross-platform development, especially through ReactNative.
