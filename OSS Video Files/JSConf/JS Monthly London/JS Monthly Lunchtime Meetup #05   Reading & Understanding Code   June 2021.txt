Code Literacy // Jessica Rose

As programmers think about our own work with code, we place an incredible emphasis on the act of production. We focus on the act of writing code as if writing and often present it as the primary way we expect to interact with a codebase.

This talk will approach codebases as living texts and explore the value of re-examining the twin skills of reading and understanding codebases. Weâ€™ll look at linguistics and literacy concepts that give us new ways to conceptualize how we read code, as well as software-specific tools and approaches we can use to further our reading skills.

jessica rose and she's going to speak

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,279
about code literacy

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,279
i'm going to pass you back to to test

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:37,289
cool

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:37,289
[Music]

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:55,350
[Music]

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,320
uh hello everybody thank you so much for

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,560
making time for me in

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,760
i guess your own office or your own home

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,079
office

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,040
um i'm always delighted to have an

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,399
excuse to

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,320
talk to folks about the stuff i'm the

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,240
most excited about but

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,519
now thanks to the horrors of the 2020s

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,440
um and the the glory and majesty of the

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,560
internet i get to talk to even more

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,279
people

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,680
uh without any of you having to commute

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,880
to

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,880
hang out i mean there's no pizza but

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,560
i i could be wearing pajama pants you

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,160
can't tell

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,600
um and i'm going to be talking to you

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,079
today about one thing that i'm

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,279
exceptionally excited about and i'm

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,800
going to be talking to you

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,640
about code and like yeah

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,560
code fine that makes sense for a

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,240
javascript conference

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,079
javascript meetup i'm going to be

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,000
talking to you specifically about the

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,320
value of reading code and really

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,920
mindfully reading code

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
and what i'd like to do is bring you a

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,040
couple of different approaches a couple

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,680
of different concepts from

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,320
linguistics a couple of concepts from

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,640
sort of

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,640
literacy education and see whether or

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,000
not we can have those feeling applicable

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,560
to the way we read and the way we

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
understand code

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,320
to start off um hey i'm jess

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
um i've been working in tech for roughly

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,680
a million years

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,279
um and one of the things i'm really

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,399
really excited about is i do a lot of

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,279
advocacy work

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,640
around access to technical education

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,519
makes sense

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,720
um and access to sort of more meaningful

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,480
access to

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,600
yeah work in technology for folks as

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,519
well um i do have a day job as well and

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
i'm i'm really excited about my day job

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,839
i work with code c

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,519
um and we're we're still in stealth

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,640
we're still in beta

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,399
but we're building tooling around the

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,519
concept of reading and understanding

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,320
code so

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,079
this felt like a perfect fit to me um i

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,360
was already a nerd about this stuff

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,360
before the job and this lets me sort of

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,240
dive fully in

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,839
um the work we do is around building

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,120
tooling to better read and understand

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,040
and communicate about

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,279
complex javascript code bases which

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,959
if you've ever seen a big old messy

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,880
javascript code base

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:21,680
is a lot well is tone wise

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,519
very similar to my first job so before

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,480
moving into technology i actually worked

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,680
in education which is

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,600
relaxing i think

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,040
it's quite challenging but very very

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,839
rewarding

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,240
um and being a former teacher i've got

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,279
some relatively opinionated takes for

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,160
you all

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,040
about reading about understanding code

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,959
and

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,120
why it's so valuable for us to be

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,839
meaningfully communicating around what

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,839
we've learned

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,200
and i find that in technology and

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,959
talking to developers and working with

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,600
developers

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,360
one thing that we often have is a hyper

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,320
fixation

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,360
on writing on building on doing the

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,200
thing

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,959
and doing things where our hands are on

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,920
the keyboard

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,800
we want to and we're often expected to

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,040
fix that bug

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,639
ship that feature do this thing right

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,480
now

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,880
and some of this is of course linked to

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,680
time developer time

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,120
is relatively expensive so companies

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,760
have a hard time

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,160
not pushing us to fix that thing or make

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,600
that other thing

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,360
but i'd argue that there's also a

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,040
cultural component that's developed

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,800
around the way we think about code and

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
the way we encounter it

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,880
while we do have space in our mental

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,639
models for the concept of a maintainer

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,000
on an open source project or on a

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,160
project overall

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,600
and that's someone who actively shapes

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,880
and shepherds the code around our

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,120
project

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,240
most of the language we use around

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,959
programming

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,519
is focused on productive tasks those

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,240
hands-on keyboard tasks

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,519
even a developer's chiefest joy deleting

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,519
lines of code

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,040
is an active hands-on experience

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,120
and what i really want to focus on this

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,440
time this session

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,639
isn't the tappy tappy parts of our job

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,320
but the reading the ingesting and

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,240
as a dedicated old-school book nerd

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,399
i'd love to say hey i'm going to talk to

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,720
you about reading code for the joy in it

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,760
it's

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,000
it's what's important for you but that's

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,360
only not not only not practical like

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,399
i'm not going to win many hearts and

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,720
minds by saying read it's cool

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,800
but it's also not being very honest

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,199
about the real value here

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,720
i want us to be more mindfully reading

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,839
code and applying different strategies

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
to read code

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,079
because it lends us more valuable

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,720
understanding

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,600
the my key argument which i fear you're

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,760
going to hear me

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,519
just raise again and again along with my

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,959
little fists

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,480
is that reading and intentional reading

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,040
is needed for the type of deep

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,519
understanding to do great things

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,040
you all are adults and you're gonna make

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,720
up your own mind for yourselves

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,000
so instead of focusing on trying to sell

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,120
you hey reading code is good for you

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,720
i'm instead gonna step back and focus on

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,320
some of the approaches that we might

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,920
borrow from linguistics and we might

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,480
borrow from education

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,519
that might be exciting to apply to

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,959
mindfully reading code

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,360
if you did decide you were so inclined

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,279
and you might reading i don't need

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,160
skills to do reading after all isn't

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,279
isn't reading just reading

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,079
reading's just reading i mean of course

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,480
you already know how to read code you

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,759
you read it as you write it

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,880
but i wanna yeah i want for us to shift

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,560
our focus

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,800
and to have reading not just be an

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,120
incidental part of your workflow

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,800
and an incidental part of writing but

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,560
really be a focused part of

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,160
what we're doing here the first concept

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,440
i want to talk to you about

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,480
is intensive reading and it's exactly

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,279
what it says on the tin

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,880
it is a lot intensive reading is a

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,519
concept oh

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,440
that uh we pull in from linguistics so

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,199
linguistics the study of language or

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,720
foreign languages or teaching language

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,079
is applied linguistics

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,160
it's language stuff um

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,120
an intensive reading has a really sort

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,199
of a cousin

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,639
in literary criticism which is called

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,639
close reading

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,560
um you could probably get away with

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,839
using these terms interchangeably if you

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,920
wanted a linguist

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,920
and a literary studies person to yell at

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,480
you so we'll we'll try and keep these

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,720
separate

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,759
they're similar in practice

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,079
um and this involves deep focus you want

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,279
to be

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,000
intense on that reading um

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,199
and that's deep often of a relatively

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,480
short section of

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:58,639
of texture code in large part because

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,959
it's hard to really deeply focus

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,079
and you're reading in intensive reading

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,799
for a set task

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,480
say hey i want you to do this thing

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,400
here's a passage

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,839
so if you think back to primary school

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,880
an example many people might have

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,199
encountered is

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,640
here's a paragraph can you go through

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,640
and circle all the nouns

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,199
um if you're looking at something a bit

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,720
higher level maybe with close reading as

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,720
opposed to intensive reading

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,079
with literary criticism it might be hey

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,160
read this passage

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:33,600
and then write me a short essay about

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,120
the thematic use of butterflies in it

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,039
and this one's really well it's

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,200
relatively easy to pull out several

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,880
examples of how we might use this encode

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,799
ourselves

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,160
um if you know there's a bug in a

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,480
section and you're

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,520
having an angry little maybe you're a

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,160
better person than me

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,960
if i'm having an angry little hunt for

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,880
it

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,280
i think that this equates really closely

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,400
to intensive reading

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,440
i might also suggest that if you're

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,280
maybe you all are much better

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,000
programmers than i am and you never have

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
to do this

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
but if you're hunting for a typo say

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,679
maybe your text editor has let you down

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,480
or you've done something

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,160
uh with wiggly brackets where your sense

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,480
has left you

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,520
i might argue that kind of okay i'm

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,520
going through

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,559
this section with great intensity with

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,600
great detail

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,880
for this task might count as well and i

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,840
think that fretting over

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,120
cursed sections of code count as well so

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,000
if you've ever encountered a piece of a

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,880
code base where someone

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,720
says oh hi don't ever touch this because

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,520
everything breaks

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,120
the kind of meditative inspection that

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,160
you might apply to this

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,400
i think counts as something very like

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,600
intensive reading

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,200
intensive reading is also kind of

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,640
miserable

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,320
um intensive reading for most people

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,240
um if you're special if you're magical

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,880
if you love this if you can do this for

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,960
hours come see me after class because i

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,120
must know your secrets

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,559
but most people most learners or most

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,880
people working

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,720
can't keep this up for long it doesn't

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,280
bring joy into our hearts

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,720
peering deeply into a paragraph or a six

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,840
line segment of code

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,480
isn't gonna feel fun it's work and it's

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,679
hard work

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,760
i've actually got an example of

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,280
an intensive reading exercise that i

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,000
completed relatively recently and this

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,039
is going to be a little

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,960
tiny bit small but the code is actually

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,280
from open whisper systems and the good

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,240
people who make signal

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,440
and the good people at codereading.org

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
which we'll talk about a little bit

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,760
later on

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,919
i'm not affiliated with them i just

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,600
think they're brilliant uh gave me this

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,799
exercise and they said

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,679
jess go through you have a set of a

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,600
relatively small

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,760
amount of time um go through this

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,600
section of code and highlight the lines

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,160
that you think are the most important

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,720
okay i'll put some squares go ahead and

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,720
pick

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,080
the variables that you think are going

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,640
to be the most important year

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,000
okay and then go ahead and show quickly

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,080
what you think these do here are sort of

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,520
the language tasks

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,480
but represented in code it feels like

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,320
homework

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,760
because it is often work but

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,919
if you want something that's a little

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,480
bit easier on the soul

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,919
let's talk skimming and scanning and

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,240
this is going to feel really familiar as

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,760
well

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,159
not just because this is something we

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,880
very commonly do with code bases

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,200
but also this is stuff we've been doing

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,039
in

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,240
our in our sort of literate adult lives

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,360
since we were little tiny kids we first

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,679
learned about skimming

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,919
as primary school students like little

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,520
babies like oh just read this quickly

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,320
and get the gist

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,960
and that's the deal just cast your eye

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,799
over this

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,000
so read it quickly for skimming

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,240
scanning's a bit different

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,840
you're just literally looking at the the

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,080
text or looking at the code

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,080
to find where you need to focus

00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,919
and you're looking for general

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,919
understanding here it's not like

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,440
intensive reading where you need to

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,480
really get involved

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,159
you just i'm very old so this text this

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,400
slang is probably over already but it's

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,919
sort of a very general vibe check

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,919
for text or code

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,080
and we've got some examples from code in

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,080
here as well

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,400
if you're looking over a new code base

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,880
so say hey welcome to your first day

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,720
at glitter corp we're so excited to have

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,480
you by the way here's the code base

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,240
you might want to skim in to be like oh

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,120
hey what's going on here how is this

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,000
structured

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,760
how do we do how do we name things

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,240
whereas scanning

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,799
you might want to scan to find a

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,799
function

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,200
oh hey this thing is broken where is

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,960
that or a section or a module

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,280
scanning is literally just searching

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,600
quite quickly

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,520
skimming and scanning while separate

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,880
similar feeling concepts

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,840
are the spiritual opposite of intensive

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,679
reading

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,799
intensive reading feels like a lot of

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,120
work skimming and scanning

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,240
they're not cognitively intensive your

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,679
brain

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,360
with a little bit of practice and with

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,760
some familiarity with code

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,280
can relatively happily sort of skip

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,600
along

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,320
without feeling tired and without

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,360
feeling

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,960
if you're me dejected in the way that

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,960
intensive reading often leaves us

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:29,360
and i want to talk about a concept that

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,720
sort of almost combines the two

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,679
extensive reading is such an exciting

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,520
concept so this

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,679
is something i use myself so i'm a

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,799
language learner having been a linguist

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:44,080
i'm not very good and it's a bit more

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,000
involved than skimming or scanning

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,919
but really really satisfying this is a

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,679
concept from linguistics and it's

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,679
relatively recent i think we've been

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,799
talking about extensive reading

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:58,240
oh i love to be wrong on a recorded uh

00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:01,840
talk so i'm gonna say from the 70s

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,559
uh nobody tell crash and if i was wrong

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,400
um and this looking at this from a

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,280
linguistic perspective

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,080
the idea is hey you're a language

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,080
learner

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:17,200
let's have you read a lot for fun

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,880
so here are some texts that are an

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,360
appropriate level they're not too

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,559
hard they're not much harder than your

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,600
current level

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,520
but we're just gonna have you read a lot

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
and chill out you don't have to look

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,840
stuff up you don't have to take notes

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,919
just sort of enjoy it which is

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,280
absolutely what you want

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,640
and a lot of the the the value of this

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,120
is often debated

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,240
but a lot of the value from extensive

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,880
reading is assumed

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,159
to come from learning from context you

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,679
say hey

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,600
we're not going to have you look things

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,400
up when they're new but we think that

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,679
you're just going to

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,279
sort of going to get them through

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,279
cognitive osmosis a bit

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,120
and this is really supposed to be an

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,520
enjoyable

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,039
exercise this isn't supposed to feel

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,960
hard this isn't supposed to feel like

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:10,080
work it's really about making reading

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,919
not suck for a learner

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,520
which i'm very very holistically about

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,039
and when you look at this concept as a

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,039
whole hey

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,480
we want to see people reading we want to

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,080
see people reading for fun we want to

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,320
see them working with texts

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,679
that are the right level so not too hard

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
and we don't want you to have to look

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,919
things up we don't want you to have to

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,120
take notes we won't want you to do tasks

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,440
how magical is this

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,559
and if we're looking at an example from

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,440
code

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:45,200
the exciting thing is i don't have any

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,520
i'm absolutely enraptured by the idea of

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,880
what would extensive reading principles

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,640
look like

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,720
if we applied these to code if we

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,039
applied these to

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,279
non-human length that sounds a bit alien

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:02,320
but non-human language texts

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,279
and it's my very gentle my an

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,480
immodest modest proposal that this would

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,880
rule

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,919
if we could determine if we could create

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,559
tooling if we could make processes

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,760
if we could create a culture where

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,120
hanging out

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,799
and reading some level appropriate code

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,799
was enjoyable if we could find a way to

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,440
make this fun if we could find a way

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:29,279
to make this not grinding

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,159
i don't have a clear idea of what that

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,919
would do for our individual skills

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,760
what that would do for our shared

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,600
understanding and what that would do

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,600
for our ability to communicate technical

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,600
problems

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,679
and having thought about this a lot this

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,080
is a big part of why i wrote this talk

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,600
so saying hey here's this thing i've

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,720
been thinking about a lot

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,360
i imagine many of you most of you all of

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,679
you

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,120
are quite a bit smarter than me here's

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,360
an idea if you can

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,360
think of any way that this fits into

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,039
your workflows or into your learning

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,039
i beg you to come back and tell me

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,640
within technology we already have a lot

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,240
of models and a lot of social models and

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,840
individual models

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,880
focused on experiences

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,960
of writing code

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,039
so we've got the social model i think

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,880
that hackathons are probably the the

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:26,400
most humane

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,000
um non-work artificial environment for

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,880
writing code

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,640
and these are a usually time limited

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,400
back in the before times they used to be

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,679
in person events where you get together

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,039
you have relatively small amount of time

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,120
and you have to try and build a thing

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,720
usually green feels usually a brand new

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,240
project

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,720
and this isn't conducive to doing a lot

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,640
of writing but we do have this model

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,880
for collaborative experiential work

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,640
in tech in program that's focused around

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,760
writing

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,760
and if you're looking for something

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,760
that's individual instead of group and

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,720
i don't want to say more evil so i'll

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,120
say less humane

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,640
we've got timed code tests or timed

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,240
coding environments

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,400
if you've never had to do one of these

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,279
it's because you work at rational places

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,520
and don't interview at terrible places

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,799
and i i hope it doesn't feel like i'm

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,480
picking on just these three because

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,600
there are dozens of companies that offer

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,240
these

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,200
but these are folks that build

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,600
off-the-shelf

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,799
time code tests for when you apply for a

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,080
job

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:36,159
and this is the kind of exercise

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,080
i'm thinking about this is a they say

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,200
assessment it's a test

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,720
um but i use as an example alongside

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,520
hackathons to say we do have

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,840
models within tech for us having

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,360
learning style experiences around

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,520
writing code

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,279
how would our experience change and what

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,559
kinds of things could we do

00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,240
to shift these around reading code

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,760
we already have some we've talked about

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,960
the well-established models in tech

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,200
around writing code

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,320
socially and individually outside of a

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,399
professional experience

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,240
outside of tech we do already have these

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,880
established models to choose from

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,080
for reading reading circles and reading

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,840
clubs and other

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,039
social groups around learning have

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,440
existed far longer than you or i

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,880
and i'm really excited around the idea

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,600
of what would happen if we took these

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,520
models

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,120
and applied them to better understanding

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,520
code

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,960
um while i was looking at this problem

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,679
while i was thinking around it

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,159
i ran into some brilliant people who

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,120
were just

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,679
out there apparently psychic and trying

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,559
to solve

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,080
all of my worries for me uh so felina

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,679
who's a fabulous professor

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,399
and katja who's absolutely brilliant as

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,039
well i believe also a professor

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,240
started a code reading club a reading

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,840
circle

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,320
of sorts for code and this is really

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,960
intentionally designed so this is a i

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,640
believe an

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,240
eight-part meetup series that he has

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,919
all of the learning materials they have

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,159
the code ready they have the exercise

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,000
ready they have the lesson plans ready

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,440
and you can bring this into your

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,559
workplace you can bring this into your

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,919
academic setting

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:19,760
if you've got friends if your friends

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:22,799
are very much like me which i i

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,960
um good

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,480
good for you being friends with weirdos

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,000
if your friends are really into the idea

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,840
of like oh what would it be

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,679
what would it mean for our understanding

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,039
to more closely examine

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,720
you can run these yourself um

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,200
just based on their lesson plans they're

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,120
out of the box and go i'm so excited

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,240
that these really exist um

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,240
a sort of adjacent plug is one of the

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,320
originators of the code reading meetups

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,760
also wrote this very very good book

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,480
that's just come out

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,559
about cognition and how our brains work

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,360
and want to work in programming

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,520
it's not exclusively around reading and

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,039
code and i don't get a kickback for it

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,559
or anything

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,279
i just found this personally very

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,080
enjoyable and useful

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,279
i confess that i'm trying to sell you on

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,440
the focus of reading code

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,520
partially out of a good old-fashioned

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,360
nerdy love of reading

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,120
but reading better and reading more

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,840
mindfully offers us

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,720
real practical benefits the goal behind

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,760
us reading

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,520
writing about or talking about code

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,279
is really the synthesis of shared

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,120
understanding

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,559
any of us with enough experience have

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,840
worked on a project that doesn't have

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,919
any shared understanding

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,200
um if you're brand new to the industry

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,919
or you're just getting into the industry

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,120
maybe you

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,480
haven't experienced that yet oh in which

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,480
case i have got some

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,840
some bad news my love um it's gonna

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,559
happen eventually and it's gonna be

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,679
miserable

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,640
but how could better reading practices

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,679
around code

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,880
make us as individuals more resilient

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,320
these projects without shared

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,880
understanding

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,000
and how could reading driving our own

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,880
understanding

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,480
be better pooled to create shared

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,720
understanding

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,799
and and sort of prevent these doom-like

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,120
projects

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,720
i want to take you way way back

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,679
and i want to talk to you really briefly

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,200
about the four core language skills

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,880
and these are something we talk about

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,559
sort of in really really early education

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,000
so you would have started doing these

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,960
well before

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,519
you entered any kind of school and these

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,519
are these are listed out in the order

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,600
in which we generally learn to do them

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,080
in our home language our first language

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,360
so we generally listen before we speak

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,000
yeah right

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,320
and then our reading skills develop more

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,919
quickly than our writing skills

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,000
also fair knowing this

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,840
and having looked at our bias and

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,080
technology for sort of hands-on

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,519
keyboards

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,399
i feel that we're doing ourselves a

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,600
disservice in skills development

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,120
we know that our passive skills develop

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,440
before our active skills

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,240
in human languages and the way we

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,159
interact with human language

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,480
i would politely but gently argue

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,039
that in programming languages in

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,039
technical language work

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,519
that there's a great potential there's a

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,360
great benefit to be had

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,559
by developing these passive skills

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,080
and i want to very gently i suppose work

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,279
shop out with you if that's not a bit

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,559
rough

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,799
um i want to sort of workshop out

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,240
a proposal for force core skills that

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,200
would enable us

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,399
to focus on these passive skills and

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,399
then translate them into active skills

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,240
and i confess that my thinking about

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,960
this is really early

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,000
i'm a terrible speaker and a terrible

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,519
person

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,080
and i've joined you in large part

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,120
because a lot of you are a lot smarter

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,559
than i am

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:07,760
and i genuinely want your opinions

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,960
so here are my to be amended four

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,320
core skills for technical work

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,880
i think the first one you're going to be

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,799
doing is reading code

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,080
yeah of some kind that may be embedded

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,679
with an editorial

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,200
and we've been talking about it a lot

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,840
during this talk we can just go ahead

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,880
and yeah

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,240
we've got reading code and then i think

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,760
you're going to be writing code

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,799
and i i think that most folks i'm

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,519
talking to are going to be like yeah

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,000
yeah i get it jess

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,919
and look at what an absolutely clunky

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,279
way i've chosen to say this like please

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,519
help me if you have a better way to say

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,279
this

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,120
but here these are any activities where

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,080
you're actively

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,600
taking in information about the code

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,960
base or information about the technical

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,559
problems or information about the

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,720
technical domain

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,880
that isn't directly from the code base

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,720
this could be reading documentation

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,679
taking an online course listening to a

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,080
co-worker describe the problem

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,360
and the next one still clunky but it's

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,760
going to make a lot of sense

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,799
this is active non-code communication

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,280
it's where you're

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,240
saying the thing or writing the thing if

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,399
you are one of the

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,399
the few and beautiful chosen few who

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,359
loves to write documentation

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,000
that that's this it could be streaming

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,879
which would be

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,240
if you're live streaming yourself coding

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,359
that could be a really interesting

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,800
combination of you

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,000
reading code because you've got to read

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,320
it while you write it writing code

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,159
and then actively engaging in non-code

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,919
communication so talking

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,079
about what you're doing as you're doing

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,520
it

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,440
i suppose if you're reading the chat

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,280
it's also passive non-code communication

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,359
how exhausting

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,879
or making a video or talking to your

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,399
co-workers would count as one of these

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,560
as well

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,599
all of these all of this sort of

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,520
different approaches

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:58,079
and academic joyous fluff

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,640
i think yeah if we take ourselves too

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,440
seriously we've gone a bit off uh office

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,560
but all of this i'm really trying to to

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,839
bring

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:12,640
myself and bring all of us to my big

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:15,280
goofy dream everybody

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,720
has a weird dream billionaires want us

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,280
to go to mars

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:22,750
precocious children want puppies most of

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,480
us have a big goal somewhere in us

00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,040
[Music]

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,040
and for me

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:37,520
my big uh my big

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:40,720
weird goal is continuous understanding

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,720
what would it mean to

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,960
have an environment where you're

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,000
constant really reading

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,000
constantly learning

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,520
um and constantly adding to

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,359
yeah what's possible for you to

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,599
understand

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,119
and for me continuous understanding

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,200
isn't just

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,640
i want to continuously understand this i

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,160
want to continually add this

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,240
in but as you're learning as you're

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,200
reading and of course writing that

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,320
you're generating

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,880
artifacts of understanding as you go um

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,000
it's a

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,839
very specific very weird dream

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,920
and one that i confess i i large

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,760
i confess that i stole the language from

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,920
my employer

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,079
um the ability to have this yeah

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,599
sort of true north in what would it look

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,400
like in education or what would it look

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,079
like in collaboration for

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,320
ongoing shared understanding to be the

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,320
goal is weird but magical

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,720
this has been a little bit tea tree so

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,240
let's talk homework i'm not your boss

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,040
and i'm not your mom and i'm not your

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,240
teacher

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,920
i can't make you do anything and i

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,520
i don't think i'd be much inclined to

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,680
try

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,680
so this is more of a gentle invitation

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,160
than actual homework for any folks

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,800
interested in trying this out

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,400
the easy stuff is hey try to

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,160
intentionally think about reading code

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,680
during your daily work

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,359
so if you if you find yourself doing

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,400
intensive rate but oh wow cool i'm doing

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:22,640
some intensive reading yeah

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,000
and try to identify when you're using

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,800
different skills around

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,480
understanding and reading and selfishly

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,079
especially if they're ones i haven't

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,200
thought of if you're like oh

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,520
i don't have a word for this but i often

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
do

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,839
this or i often do that with reading

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,640
code yeah identifying the skills

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,359
identifying the approaches seems so

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,520
valuable

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,520
around intentionality and reading code

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,079
if you don't mind if it's a bother

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,520
please try one of the reading techniques

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,400
i've outlined here

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,240
i'd love to hear whether or not yeah how

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,520
how applicable and how valuable you find

00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,200
them

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,359
because i've mostly just been torturing

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,320
my team with them

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,920
um it's not my project but i love it if

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,680
you've got the time and interest

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,760
please check out one of the code reading

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,880
workshops from codereading.org i believe

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,400
and most selfishly please please please

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,240
i beg you

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,680
bring me back any feedback you're

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,720
comfortable with you could come back and

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,480
be like jess

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,560
i tried some of these reading techniques

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,400
and they're rubbish and be like

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,920
thank you this is still really valuable

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,200
information

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,440
um and because

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,200
ongoing education ongoing learning is a

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,320
two-way street

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,760
i've also got homework for me um

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,440
coming out of this talk and coming out

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,400
of future work my

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,359
homework for for me for everyone for

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,200
them

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,119
i was about to be a big grand oh my

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,760
homework for the wider tech community

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,760
like nah my homework for me is to

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,000
continue to read about and understand

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,200
and teach about where i can reading and

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,200
code

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,640
and if and when folks are lovely enough

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,320
to give me feedback i promise to

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,240
continue to integrate them into my

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,440
understanding and feedback

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,040
and i promise to keep working on

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,520
building tooling around reading and

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,400
understanding code

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,240
i did mention that i work at codexy as a

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,960
very very short and shameless plug

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,040
we are in beta so we're still working on

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,640
some tooling to help people read and

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,839
understand

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,960
javascript code bases i'm such a big

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,760
nerd about feedback

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,000
if anybody wanted to test this out um

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,720
i'm

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,320
super my boss isn't looking i can yeah

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,880
i'll give y'all y'all access

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,520
um i'm super happy to give you free beta

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,480
access

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,320
it's free money wise but i will lightly

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,119
tax you by politely asking you

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,720
with feedback if you do try it out um if

00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,760
you did want to try it out or

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:53,280
give me feedback and you find me at jess

00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:56,000
codec.io because i am a big old nerd

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,960
i've gone ahead and sourced uh source

00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,520
out where all my

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,040
illustrations and diagrams come from and

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,319
also where you can learn more

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,880
about the different concepts listed here

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:11,839
um fabulous are there any questions i

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,839
can answer for anybody

00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:26,820
[Music]

00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,600
[Music]

00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,839
so

00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:52,639
[Music]

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,280
thank you very much jess this was an

00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,720
amazing talk

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,720
um yeah i can see a lot of um

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,480
questions that i have but let's check

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,240
with the audience

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:12,240
and if there are any questions for you

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,880
and yeah so happily and

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,920
yeah there's there's some hellos from my

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,760
ramen

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,079
oh hey ramon i actually work with ramon

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,280
so

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,560
he usually gets me be like oh hey i was

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,599
thinking this thing about reading

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,280
concepts and

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,440
he's just so gracious where he's just

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,040
like yup yup just can't consistently

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,680
polite around it

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,680
yet the stuff you spoke about they

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,200
brought me a lot of

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,800
memories from bloom's taxonomies and how

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,880
people are learning and in general

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,720
you know because when you are reading

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,839
somebody else's code

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,400
basically you are analyzing and there

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,960
are like

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,960
certain kind of steps that you have to

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,280
take in order to be able to

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,119
to actually oh this is the code that

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,280
somebody else written

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,240
and now i'm gonna go and write something

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,839
on top of that

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,560
and yeah that's i'd go probably a step

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,920
further as well like i think that we're

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,440
we're really comfortable looking at

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,480
somebody else's code and be like i don't

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,520
know what happened here

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:19,200
these aren't rational decisions um

00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,720
but i think anybody who's been around

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,319
who stayed on the same code base long

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,079
enough to forget something

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,599
has definitely had the experience where

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,839
you come into a code base and you say

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,839
who wrote this this is chaos oh it was

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:34,480
me

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,000
so really to be able to read and deeply

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,000
understand and reflect on

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,640
especially your own code is so valuable

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,319
then you said the magic word reflection

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,920
because the teaching and learning

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:50,240
is based on reflection and basically

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,319
you when you see something you reflect

00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,440
on something that you know

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,480
and yeah i mean this magic

00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,119
another magic word for um learners and

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,800
teachers because we learn from reading

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:08,960
other people's code um

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,440
yeah like i am um i'm um

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,000
i just blathered on for ages at you all

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,160
you can guess

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,760
that i'm obnoxiously passionate around

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,760
the idea of like hey what does reading

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,920
and understanding mean

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,119
um but it does give us the opportunity

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,119
to embed

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,280
teaching and embed shared learning more

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,880
deeply within our teams

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,760
um many

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,240
all of us have had experience all of us

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,240
will have experiences where

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,359
we don't understand the larger context

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,480
of what we're working on but we

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,240
understand

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,160
this line of code or these 12 lines of

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,880
code sort of

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,119
um and that often breaks things in

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,560
really exciting ways

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,079
perfect understanding is a lie we're

00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,079
never going to magically like oh i

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,000
understand everything i've

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,359
learned all of oh what's what's

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,760
absolutely challenging for me

00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,240
i've learned all of haskell i can i can

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,400
just just work off of that forever

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,880
um yeah i think perfect understanding's

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,560
a lie but understanding that you need to

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,000
continually come back to something and

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,640
continually re-read

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,800
and this sort of um constant communion

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,640
of of coming back and learning and

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,760
refreshing is

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,640
exhausting and exciting so tell us a bit

00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,680
about

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,400
codes and what what it actually does in

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,640
terms of

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,520
what you just spoke and how does it

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,800
relates

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,760
to to your talk and how it will help

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,000
people from

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,000
being able to read and understand the

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,040
code yeah

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,240
uh so cozy we're we're still in stealth

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,680
and we're in private beta at the moment

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,880
so i'll talk about it in sort of broad

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,800
strokes but again if

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,040
anybody wants to check it out i'm jess

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,839
at codec.io and i'll i'll i'll get you

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,400
sorted immediately

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:54,319
but it's um partially works around

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,680
code-based visualization so the ability

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,839
to take

00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,680
a section or an activity and zoom out a

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,280
bit and say hey

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,880
when you changed this or when you did

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,839
this here are the different components

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,040
here are the different things that

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,200
happened

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,760
let's go ahead and fix let's create an

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,319
artifact of understanding around this

00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,240
and then from there we can add notes we

00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,560
can have a technical discussion we can

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,599
zip this back and forth

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,119
and we can also yeah so

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,400
we've seen a couple different use cases

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,480
a lot of people are using this for

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,400
onboarding so saying hey

00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,520
new developers or new developers joining

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,880
our team

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,960
here's how this works here's how this

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,599
works let me sort of show you let me

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,599
show to generate these recordings

00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,839
that show you how this works and what we

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,079
changed and also

00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,680
when a piece of code is cursed so say

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,119
hey

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,960
don't touch this everything breaks the

00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,319
ability to go through and say oh

00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,319
actually when this breaks

00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,240
these are the things that break so we're

00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,079
seeing folks using it in bug fixing

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,599
we're seeing folks use it to fix flaky

00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,359
tests

00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,720
and at the stage we're at now the

00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,319
product

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,720
i'm such a goof they pay me of course i

00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,880
think the product's really fantastic

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,119
but the product's feeling really really

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,240
exciting and really stable

00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,839
and the thing i'm as a teacher really

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,400
selfishly interested to learn more and

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:14,560
more about

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:17,359
are how folks are using it day to day

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,160
okay is there is it like a demo you

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,359
could

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,440
post into oh yeah yeah yeah is it

00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,920
is it possible to post something on our

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,520
yeah youtube channel so people can

00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,160
can see it later on so happily

00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,079
i'll get that right now you can hear me

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,560
like tap tap tapping in the background

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,760
yeah no that's fine and also can i ask

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,280
you is it possible

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,960
let's say you have a project and there's

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,119
no documentation

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,800
does code say create a backward

00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,880
documentation for you so like it can

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,760
take parts of code and

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,280
and um like start documenting them so

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,119
there's like um

00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,040
yeah sort of the ability to reverse

00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,400
engineer documentation where

00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,880
documentation should have already

00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,880
existed

00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:05,280
so yes i'm going to say yes and

00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,760
yes but so cozy i really like it for

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,800
creating

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,560
supplemental documentation and for doing

00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,480
this kind of archaeological work

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,760
so so like you said this isn't

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,760
documented oh no what does this do

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,880
cozy can be a really good first and

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,280
second and third step to investigation

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,640
i want to be really cautious and and say

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,640
it's not magic though

00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,000
so getting code c out and saying hey

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,000
we've got this section of code we've got

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,079
this feature that's not documented

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
let's use code c to unpick what's going

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,960
on i'm then going to

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
very firmly and very lovingly say you've

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,359
still got to document

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,040
it once you've done the investigation

00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,960
work with codec

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:47,119
yeah i saw it yeah no definitely

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,800
so earlier that you mentioned about

00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:53,520
these platforms that

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:56,079
they that they they're used to

00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,240
like a hackerrank or other other

00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,240
platforms that

00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,480
some of them can be useful because you

00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,000
you can you can

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,000
improve your problem solving but

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,119
sometimes those are used into

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,559
interviews what is your take and how

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,839
would you go about it

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:19,920
in a different way yeah um

00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:22,480
so so programs like um programs uh

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,119
where you're like hey do timed code

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,599
tests

00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,960
to practice for or to get rank because

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,160
or to practice for the tests you're

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:33,040
going to likely see in interviews

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,160
it's like taking standardized tests in

00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,240
school

00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,920
um the only thing they teach you is the

00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,359
test i'd argue

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,319
um so i i don't like them as assessment

00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,240
exercises

00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,359
in like if you're an employer and you're

00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,720
using those

00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,240
please get in touch with me so i can

00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,680
lovingly fuss you out and offer

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,319
alternatives

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,839
um but i don't often find that they're

00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:55,839
they're really valuable for learners

00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,000
what you're actually learning is

00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,640
how do i do a timed code test or how do

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,079
i do these little tiny code tests

00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:07,599
the exception i might say um

00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,960
um i do quite like exorcism i've never

00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,680
seen exorcism used

00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,680
in um in interview processes and that

00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:18,240
might be a big part of it

00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:20,319
um but that's um coding challenges

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,440
that that are sort of more thoughtful

00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,559
and

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,720
graded by humans so it's more about how

00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,760
did you approach this what did you do

00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,160
and feels quite a bit more like a an

00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,000
academic learning experience

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,680
whereas when you see these ones where

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,760
you're applying for a job

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,760
here's 12 questions find all the bugs

00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:46,640
oh i i i no no thank you

00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,280
both for employers and employees and

00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,760
i mean in your experience how have you

00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,119
seen

00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,079
this kind of tests failing in the long

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,480
in the long run

00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,559
have you seen yeah so i actually just

00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:02,079
had a conversation with a friend

00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,800
who is an engineer at oh i need an

00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:07,920
imaginary company name at cookiecorp

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,240
um and cookiecorp is looking to use

00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,079
they're just bringing in one of these

00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,200
testing systems to test their new

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,880
applicants um and what my friend did was

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,359
take the test

00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,319
um and they've been an engineer at

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,240
cookiecorp for

00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,920
a couple years now and they just failed

00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,079
i think they got like eight percent on

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,599
one of the questions

00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:32,000
um so to be able to say like look

00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,680
there's no value here like i'm your lead

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,520
dev i do all these things

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,800
it didn't like what i did and it's

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,160
grading me on

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:43,599
and oftentimes they grade applicants on

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:47,680
aspects that aren't listed

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:50,880
um i confess i hate them very much

00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:53,599
yeah i'm pretty sure a lot of people do

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,400
but yeah it's reading somebody else's

00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,559
code

00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,359
is uh it's quite a difficult kind of

00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,599
thing so when you get to a company

00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,400
and you need to be able to to do

00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,880
anything

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,240
with code c and what you just told us

00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,920
it's probably going to be

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,839
easier to do so isn't it um

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,240
oh i think i'd fuss somebody out if they

00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,280
used code c as a as a as an employment

00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,800
test as well

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,040
i think i just like to fuss people out

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,359
for using employment tests

00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,880
um i think that for folks coming into a

00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,520
team codesy would be most valuable on

00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,960
the onboarding side so say hey

00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:32,319
um let's explore what this does let's

00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,680
and like when i show you how this

00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,520
module works when i show you how this

00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,960
feature works under the hood

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,880
we can go ahead and create a recording

00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,640
we could create an artifact of shared

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,760
understanding

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,400
um where we'll talk about this together

00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,359
we'll do that

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,720
active active community active non-code

00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,920
communication

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,240
but while we're doing that we'll go

00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,599
ahead and generate this artifact of

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,800
shared understanding so you can come

00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,800
back and this is something durable

00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,240
well what does code see using on the

00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,800
background

00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,400
that um you know probably makes it so

00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:08,640
smart to be able to

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:12,319
to help the developer um

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,880
oh so i think i would our engineering

00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:17,680
team are just absolutely brilliant

00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,000
so like all of their hard work um but i

00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,280
think

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,480
it's really sorry i'm not usually so

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,280
prodigy

00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,800
um i think what and it's rather hard to

00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,640
talk about an abstract i've just pinged

00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,800
you a link to the video if you like

00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,160
yeah i push it into the youtube channel

00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,680
no worries

00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,520
i think one of the challenges is

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,160
describing a tool

00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,680
which um which is really really valuable

00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,920
around

00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,680
visualizing and around communicating

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:47,520
describing it just with words

00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:50,400
always leaves me a little bit um

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,280
out of my depth i think the the real

00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,640
value is

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,119
the ability to zoom in and out the

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,880
ability to say hey here is a snapshot of

00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,000
this kind of context

00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:02,079
um i've come in and i've changed

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,359
this or i've changed that line of code

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:07,440
or i've done this

00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,920
task on this code base i'm able to see

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,400
what this touched and what this changed

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,520
and what i need to look out for

00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,559
um yeah i think that the a lot of the

00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,520
value there

00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,280
is just the ability to read it in a very

00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,559
very different way

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,960
um i've heard it compared to sort of the

00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,079
like google maps or open street maps if

00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,839
you're not a google person

00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,839
the ability to zoom out and say hey

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,319
show me show me the different things

00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,480
that are involved in this

00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:40,319
activity are involved in this call or

00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,760
the ability to come in fairly tightly

00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,599
and say

00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,240
i want to have a discussion just around

00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:49,280
this very very clear aspect of this

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,440
let's attach a discussion to

00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,640
individual parts of this recording so

00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,760
individual parts

00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,640
of this technical process which is

00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,040
usually

00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,319
over in a second and you're left trying

00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,960
to describe it

00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:05,280
with all the challenges i have

00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,920
describing it right now

00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,319
um yeah i think the the ability to zoom

00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,680
out and the ability to make the quick

00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:16,400
and ephemeral lasting if that doesn't

00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:19,280
sound too um too philosophical are the

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,839
things i'm i'm most excited about

00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,880
and i mean before we go because i know

00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:26,000
you've been

00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,400
part of the community quite a lot and

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,800
and before you were working in a lot of

00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,119
open source projects and

00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,839
what is your take on the the future of

00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:38,960
web and how things are moving on

00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:40,720
with them with the community oh and oh

00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,280
gosh that's huge

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:47,119
uh jess what's going to happen with the

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,119
web and what's going on with the web um

00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,720
because it's 2021 and everything's been

00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,799
very stressful

00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,079
immediately i go for the least hopeful

00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,680
things where i'm like well you know i

00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,960
continue to be really concerned

00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,440
around uh privacy i continue to be

00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,440
really

00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,680
concerned around stuff like cross-site

00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,920
tracking

00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,119
and one thing like for us as developers

00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,640
i continue to be really

00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,640
concerned around um

00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,839
the tendency to develop for the web and

00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,880
the tendency to develop

00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:21,440
web applications and websites um that

00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,680
don't really take into account

00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,680
the connections and the performance of a

00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,079
global audience so

00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,920
we've got hundreds of millions of folks

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,599
coming online for the first time and the

00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,119
the good people at the web foundation do

00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,640
a lot of research around that i'd push

00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,119
people there

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,960
a lot of times i feel that we we shove

00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,880
another framework in or are like oh

00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,760
let's put in these huge video

00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,599
like hey what would happen if we

00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,280
stripped things down and felt a little

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,359
bit old school and made things

00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,559
easier for folks on old hardware or

00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:56,319
folks on third or secondhand hardware

00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:57,839
much more hopefully the positives i see

00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,520
on the on the web and the direction

00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,240
we're going right now is is more and

00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,280
more people

00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,119
are getting involved as users

00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,960
um and and really practically we're

00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,359
seeing the price of connectivity come

00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,240
down

00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:11,119
globally at a huge speed and we're

00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,200
seeing

00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,160
largely mobile largely mobile first and

00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,599
mobile-only populations come in

00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,079
and they're experiencing the web for the

00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:23,599
first time in really durable ways

00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:24,799
to see folks move from coming in and

00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,880
it's their first time on the web

00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:31,200
too oh wow this is a series of publicly

00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,160
editable documents

00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,640
um continues to be magic so getting the

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,799
the

00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,559
massive opportunity to work with

00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:39,200
learners folks just learning to build

00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,599
for the web

00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,640
or folks just learning to access the web

00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,720
is

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,720
yeah the the primary honor of my my

00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,799
professional career

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,559
and i mean i don't know if you want to

00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,920
discuss but i would like to ask you also

00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:55,200
about mozilla and

00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,480
what is the future of and all the hard

00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,720
work

00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,559
developing tools for the wider community

00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,040
uh so i actually haven't been with

00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:07,359
mozilla for a little bit over a year now

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,880
and i'm a massive fan of the world i

00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,240
continue to be a massive fan of the work

00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,359
they do

00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:16,640
um i i confess that i can't tell you

00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:18,079
much about where i think they're going

00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,240
overall or where i think they're going

00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,280
with most of their projects

00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,319
um as a language nerd and as somebody

00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,559
with limited time

00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,480
i've continued to keep close tabs on the

00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,240
common voice project

00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,839
which is something i'm just such a huge

00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,200
fan of and they continue to do great

00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:35,599
work with

00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,640
um but off the top of my head the folks

00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,040
over at the hubs

00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,040
so an in-browser vr experience continue

00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,880
to do really cool things

00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,240
and i'm seeing them do more and more

00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,839
work with common voice in

00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,839
new linguistic markets new language

00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:49,839
markets which is really exciting to me

00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,440
so i'm still really exciting to see what

00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,559
mozilla is doing but sort of from an

00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,440
observer

00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,880
perspective instead of an internal one

00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,040
thank you very much i am

00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,200
i don't have any ques other questions

00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:04,319
and it was a really pleasant uh

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,920
discussion and there are no there are no

00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,559
questions but if there are any questions

00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,400
you can

00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:13,920
always post them on twitter or on the

00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:16,880
on the youtube feed this youtube feed

00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,319
will be available after the talk so

00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,640
people can go back and

00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:21,359
watch it and if they haven't been able

00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:25,359
because they were

00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:28,000
quite busy at work and or they can take

00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:29,680
some time off later during the week i

00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,359
mean not on the weekends though it's not

00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,040
allowed to watch the stuff on weekends

00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:34,400
weekends are only for video games and

00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,880
naps

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,000
yeah but still i mean if we are if they

00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,680
are nerds like us

00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,599
they might they might do and it's

00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,079
something quite nice to watch

00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,359
yeah and thank you very much for uh for

00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,599
being at our meet

up and uh during lunch time there were a

00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,599
lot of people watching us

00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,040
and they will be watching during the day

00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,079

gab about my passions and yeah

00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:04,480

i will joyously bother anybody who wants

00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:18,080
