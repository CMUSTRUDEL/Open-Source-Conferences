Building a high performance financial web application with JavaScript
Pawel Badenski

A short summary of one team's journey to run a real-time financial calculation engine in the browser using JavaScript. Buffet üçî üçü ü•§ style (as in food, not Warren) presentation with something for everyone - React & Redux, V8 optimisations, monads and evolving simple design.

Pawel is a cofounder & CTO @ Pricing Monkey and has been a coder for nearly 15 years. Performance engineering has been one of his biggest passions in software. He got hooked many years ago when working on a Java-based airline scheduling system. Then he switched his focus to JavaScript and the world of browsers. One thing stays the same, as my former colleague said to me many years ago "Contrary to what many people think - performance engineering is hard."
