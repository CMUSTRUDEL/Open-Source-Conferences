Agenda
Fantastic (Webpack) 5 // Tim Benniks

Tim will take us through the new features of Webpack 5 and also provide some examples where we could benefit in our day to day development

Under-the-hood of type systems (e.g. TypeScript) // Craig Taub

This talk aims to shine a light on some of the fundamentals at work under-the-hood for type systems such as TypeScript or Flow. It is not possible to focus on everything in 1 article so here we will be looking at "type checks" specifically.

Starting with an overview of type systems then building our own compiler which can run type checks and output sensible messages.

Find Me If You Can: Algolia Search is Easy // Gleb Bahmutov

Having a good text search is the key to successful documentation, especially as the number of pages, examples, code recipes, answers, and other =user-facing text snippets grows. In this presentation, I will show how to set up the Algolia search index and use it from a static site to make sure your users find _everything_ they are looking for.
