Code Literacy
Jessica Rose

As programmers think about our own work with code, we place an incredible emphasis on the act of production. We focus on the act of writing code as if writing and often present it as the primary way we expect to interact with a codebase.

This talk will approach codebases as living texts and explore the value of re-examining the twin skills of reading and understanding codebases. Weâ€™ll look at linguistics and literacy concepts that give us new ways to conceptualize how we read code, as well as software-specific tools and approaches we can use to further our reading skills.

	00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,790
I'm always delighted to have an excuse, to talk to folks about the stuff I'm

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:13,860
the most excited about, but now thanks to the horrors of the 2020s and the

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,390
glory and majesty of the internet.

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,930
I get to talk to even more people without any of you having to commute to hang out.

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,940
I mean, there's no pizza, but.

00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:26,245
I, I could be wearing pajama pants.

00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:28,855
You can't tell, and I'm going to be talking to you today about one thing

00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:33,685
that I'm exceptionally excited about, and I'm going to be talking to you about.

00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,560
Code and like, yeah, code fine.

00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,129
That makes sense.

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,129
For a JavaScript conference, JavaScript meetup.

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,879
I'm going to be talking to you specifically about the value of reading

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,070
code and really mindfully reading code.

00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,150
And what I'd like to do is bring you a couple of different approaches, a couple

00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:56,470
of different concepts from linguistics, a couple of concepts from sort of, literacy

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,599
education and see whether or not we can have those feeling applicable to the

00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:02,190
way we read and the way we understand.

00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:03,649
To start off.

00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:05,635
Hey, I'm Jess.

00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:09,685
I've been working in tech for roughly a million years.

00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:14,695
And one of the things I'm really, excited about is I do a lot of advocacy work

00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:17,125
around access to technical education.

00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:18,245
Makes sense.

00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:22,395
And access to sort of more meaningful access to.

00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,289
Yeah, work in technology for folks as well.

00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:29,885
I do have a day job as well, and I'm, really excited about my day job.

00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:34,295
I work with code C and we're, still in stealth.

00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,135
We're still in beta.

00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:37,675
But we're building tooling.

00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:41,195
Around the concept of reading and understanding code.

00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:43,805
So this felt like a perfect fit to me.

00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:47,975
I was already a nerd about this stuff before the job.

00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:52,955
And this lets me sort of dive fully in the work we do is around building

00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:57,065
tooling to better read and understand and communicate about complex JavaScript

00:01:57,065 --> 00:02:00,605
code bases, which if you've ever seen.

00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,440
Big old, messy JavaScript code base is a lot.

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,449
Well is tone wise, very similar to my first job.

00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,299
So before moving into technology, I actually worked

00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,760
in education, which is relaxing.

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,845
I think it's quite challenging, but very, rewarding.

00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:25,715
Being a former teacher, I've got some relatively opinionated takes

00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:31,205
for you all about reading, about understanding code and why it's so

00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:35,525
valuable for us to be meaningfully communicating around what we've learned.

00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:39,905
And I find that in technology and talking to developers and working with developers.

00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:47,035
One thing that we often have is a hyper fixation on writing on building

00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:51,935
on doing the thing and doing things where our hands are on the keyboard.

00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:56,965
We want to, and we're often expected to fix that bug ship.

00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:59,365
That feature do this thing right now.

00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:04,165
And some of this is of course, linked to time developer time.

00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:06,554
Is relatively expensive.

00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:11,744
So companies have a hard time not pushing us to fix that thing or make

00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,255
that other thing, but I'd argue that there's also a cultural component

00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:18,644
that's developed around the way we think about code and the way we encounter it.

00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:22,334
While we do have space in our mental models for the concept of

00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:26,174
a maintainer on an open source project or on a project overall.

00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:30,105
And that's someone who actively shapes and shepherds the code around.

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,000
Most of the language we use around programming is

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,800
focused on productive tasks.

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:43,160
Those hands on keyboard tasks, even a developers, chiefest joy, deleting lines

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,000
of code is an active hands-on experience.

00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:53,505
And what I really want to focus on this time, this session, isn't the Tappy

00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:59,625
parts of our job, but the reading, the ingesting, and as a dedicated

00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:03,795
old school book, nerd, I'd love to say, Hey, I'm going to talk to you

00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:05,775
about reading code for the joy in it.

00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:07,635
It's, what's important for you.

00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:12,195
But that's only not, only, not practical, like I'm not going to win

00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:14,175
many hearts and minds by saying read.

00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:19,755
It's cool, but it's also not being very honest about the real value here.

00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:23,715
I want us to be more mindfully reading code and applying different

00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:28,065
strategies to read code because it lends us more valuable understanding.

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,230
The my key argument, which I fear you're going to hear me just raise again.

00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,720
And again, along with my little fists is that reading and intentional reading

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,890
isn't needed for the type of deep understanding to do great things.

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,450
You all are adults, and you're going to make up your own mind for yourselves.

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,410
So instead of focusing on trying to sell you, Hey, reading code is good for you.

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,870
I'm instead going to step back and focus on some of the approaches that

00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,430
we might borrow from linguistics.

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,810
And we might borrow from education that might be exciting to apply

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,830
to mindfully reading code.

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,290
If you did decide you were so inclined and you like reading, I

00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,750
don't need skills to do reading after all isn't reading, just reading.

00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:16,725
Readings, just reading.

00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:21,287
I mean, of course you already know how to read code.

00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:23,025
You, read it as you write it.

00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:23,625
Yeah.

00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:28,275
I want for us to shift our focus and to have reading, not just be an

00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:33,315
incidental part of your workflow and an incidental part of writing, but really

00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:35,345
be a focused part of what we're doing.

00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:40,155
The first concept I want to talk to you about is intensive reading.

00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,825
And it's exactly what it says on the tin.

00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:48,344
It is a lot intensive reading is a concept, Ohh, that we

00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:49,544
pull in from linguistics.

00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:53,655
So linguistics, the study of language or foreign languages or teaching language

00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:58,635
is applied linguistics it's language stuff, and intensive reading has a

00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:03,195
really sort of a cousin in literary criticism, which is called close reading.

00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:07,425
Could probably get away with using these terms interchangeably.

00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:11,325
If you wanted a linguist and a literary studies person to yell at you.

00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:13,515
So we'll, try and keep these separate.

00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:18,375
Similar in practice and this involves deep focus.

00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,565
You want to be intense on that reading.

00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:28,275
And that's deep often of a relatively short section of, text or code in large

00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:35,505
part because it's hard to really deeply focus and your reading in intensive

00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:37,685
reading for a set tasks and hey!

00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:39,625
I want you to do this thing.

00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,794
Here's a passage.

00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:44,664
So if you think back to primary school, an example, many people might've

00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:47,065
encountered is here's a paragraph.

00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,504
Can you go through and circle all the nouns?

00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:53,580
If you're looking at something a bit higher level, maybe with close

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,880
reading, as opposed to intensive reading would literary criticism, it

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,530
might be, Hey, read this passage and then write me a short essay about the

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,660
thematic use of butterflies in it.

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,550
And this one's really well.

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,760
It's relatively easy to pull out several examples of how we

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,815
might use this encode ourselves.

00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:15,820
If you know, there's a bug in a section and you're having an angry.

00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:21,030
Maybe you're a better person than me if I'm having an angry little hunt for it.

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,659
I think that this equates really closely to intensive reading.

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,719
I might also suggest that if you're, maybe you all are much better programmers

00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:34,620
than I am, and you never have to do this, but if you're hunting for a typo, say

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,210
maybe your text editor has let you down, or you've done something with wiggly

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,820
brackets where your census left you.

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,190
I might argue that kind of, okay, I'm going through this section with

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,060
great intensity, with great detail for this task might count as well.

00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:56,100
And I think that fretting over cursed sections of code count as well.

00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,830
So if you've ever encountered a piece of a code base where someone says,

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,920
oh, hi, don't ever touch this because everything breaks the kind of meditative

00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,290
inspection that you might apply to this.

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,150
I think counts as.

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,200
Something very like intensive reading and intensive reading is also kind

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,170
of miserable intensive reading.

00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:23,895
For most people if you're special, if you're magical, if you love this,

00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:27,885
if you can do this for hours, come see me after class because I must

00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:32,534
know your secrets, but most people, most learners, almost people working.

00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:35,205
Can't keep this up for long time.

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,190
Bring joy into our hearts, peering deeply into a paragraph

00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,050
or a six line segment of code.

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,850
Isn't going to feel fun.

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,190
It's work and it's hard work.

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,620
I've actually got an example of an intensive reading exercise that

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,090
I completed relatively recently.

00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,959
And this is going to be a little tiny bit small.

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,760
But the code is actually from open whisper systems and the

00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,020
good people who make signal.

00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:03,555
And the good people at codereading.org, which we'll

00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,055
talk about a little bit later on.

00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:06,525
I'm not affiliated with them.

00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:07,465
I just think they're brilliant.

00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:12,135
Gave me this exercise and they said, yes, go through.

00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,175
You have a set of relatively small amount of time.

00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:19,095
Go through this section of code and highlight the lines that you

00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:20,055
think are the most important.

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:20,970
Okay.

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,600
I'll put some squares.

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,800
Go ahead and pick the variables that you think are going to

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,730
be the most important year.

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,330
Okay.

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,110
And then go ahead and show quickly what you think these do here are sort of the

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,590
language tasks, but represented in code.

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:35,070
Okay.

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,820
It feels like homework because it is often work.

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,150
But if you want something that's a little bit easier on the soul, let's

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,140
talk skimming and scanning, and this is going to feel really familiar as well.

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,460
Not just because this is something we very commonly do with code bases, but

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,380
also this is stuff we've been doing.

00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,640
In our and our sort of literate adult lives.

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,670
Since we were little tiny kids, we first learned about skimming as primary school

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,020
students, like little babies, like, oh, just read this quickly and get the gist.

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,310
And that's the deal.

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,890
Just cast your eye over this.

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,460
So read it quickly for skimming.

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,950
Scanning's a bit different.

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,400
You're just literally looking at the text or looking at the code

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,920
to find where you need to focus.

00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:25,859
And you're looking for general understanding here.

00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:29,459
It's not like intensive reading where you need to really get involved.

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,890
It's just, I'm very old.

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,640
This text, this slang is probably over already, but it's sort of a very

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,339
general vibe check for text or code.

00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:41,795
We've got some examples from code in here as well.

00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:45,755
If you're looking over a new code base, so say, Hey, welcome to

00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:47,705
your first day at glitter Corp.

00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,765
We're so excited to have you, by the way, here's the code base.

00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,075
You might want to skim it.

00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:53,885
Just be like, oh, Hey, what's going on here?

00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:55,205
How is this structured?

00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:57,065
How do we do, how do we name things?

00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:03,040
Whereas scanning, you might want to scan to find a function.

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,600
Oh, Hey, this thing is broken.

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,410
Where is that?

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,490
Or a section or a module scannings, literally just searching quite

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,110
quickly, skimming and scanning.

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,610
What was separate, similar feeling concepts are the spiritual

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,280
opposite of intensive reading.

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,930
Intensive reading feels like a lot of work skimming and scanning.

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,350
They're not cognitively intensive your brain.

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,380
With a little bit of practice.

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,640
And with some familiarity with code can relatively happily sort of skip

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,960
along without feeling tired and without feeling, if you're me dejected in the way

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,090
that intensive reading often leaves us.

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:51,000
And I want to talk about a concept that sort of almost combines the two extensive

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,225
reading is, such an exciting concept.

00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:56,175
So this is something I use myself.

00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,635
So I'm a language learner having been a linguist.

00:11:58,665 --> 00:11:59,775
I'm not very good.

00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,735
And it's a bit more involved than skimming or scanning.

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,630
But really, satisfying.

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,170
This is a concept from linguistics and it's relatively recent.

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,970
I think we've been talking about extensive reading.

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,140
Ooh, I love to be wrong on a recorded talk.

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,760
So I'm going to say from the seventies, nobody tell crash, and if I was

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,010
wrong and this looking at this from a linguistic perspective, the idea

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,710
is, Hey, you're a language learner.

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,260
Let's have you read a lot for fun.

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,990
So here are some texts that are an appropriate level.

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,520
They're not too hard.

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,090
They're not much harder than your current level, but we're just

00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,740
going to have you read a lot.

00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,525
And chill out.

00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:46,995
You don't have to look stuff up.

00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:50,415
You don't have to take notes, just sort of enjoy it, which

00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:51,915
is absolutely what you want.

00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:58,875
And a lot of the, value of this is often debated, but a lot of the value.

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,790
From extensive reading is assumed to come from learning from context.

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,090
You say, Hey, we're not going to have you look things up when they're

00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,210
new, but we think that you're just going to sort of going to get them

00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,250
through cognitive osmosis a bit.

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,420
This is really supposed to be an enjoyable exercise.

00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,310
This isn't supposed to feel hard.

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,870
This isn't supposed to feel like work.

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,910
It's really about making reading, not suck for a learner.

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,435
Which I'm very, holistically about.

00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:32,195
And would you look at this concept as a whole?

00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:35,165
Hey, we want to see people reading.

00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:36,605
We want to see people reading for fun.

00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:39,665
We want to see them working with texts that are the right level.

00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:40,505
So not too hard.

00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:42,455
And we don't want you to have to look things up.

00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:43,895
We don't want you to have to take notes.

00:13:43,895 --> 00:13:45,725
We don't want you to do tasks.

00:13:46,295 --> 00:13:48,095
How magical is this?

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,620
And if we're looking at an example from code, the exciting thing is I don't

00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:02,790
have any, I'm absolutely enraptured by the idea of what would extensive

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,740
reading principles look like if we applied these to code, if we apply these

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,710
to non-human lang- that sounds a bit alien, but non-human language texts.

00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:21,025
And it's my very gentle, my, immodest modest proposal that this would rule.

00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:26,035
If we could determine if we create tooling, if we could make processes,

00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:32,214
if we could create a culture where hanging out and reading some level

00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:35,095
appropriate code was enjoyable.

00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:37,345
If we could find a way to make this fun, if we could find a

00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:40,915
way to make this not grinding.

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,540
I don't have a clear idea of what that would do for our individual skills, what

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,500
that would do for our shared understanding and what that would do for our ability

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,570
to communicate technical problems.

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,610
And having thought about this a lot, this is a big part of why I wrote this talk.

00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,270
So saying, Hey, here's this thing I've been thinking about a lot.

00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,330
I imagine many of you most.

00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:08,055
All of you are quite a bit smarter than me.

00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,405
Here's an idea.

00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:13,695
If you can think of any way that this fits into your workflows or into your

00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:20,535
learning, I beg you to come back and tell me within technology, we already

00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:26,625
have a lot of models and a lot of social models and individual models focused on.

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,060
Experiences of writing code.

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,570
So we've got the social model.

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:40,740
I think that hackathons are probably the, most humane non-work artificial

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,270
environment for writing code.

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,640
And these are a, usually time-limited back in the before times, they used to be

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,820
in-person events where you get together.

00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,200
You'll have relatively small amount of time and you have

00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,160
to try and build a thing.

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,840
Usually Greenfield's usually a brand new project and this isn't conducive

00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:06,090
to doing a lot of writing, but we do have this model for collaborative

00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,140
experiential work in tech in program that's focused around writing.

00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:14,130
And if you're looking for something that's individual instead of

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,180
group, and I don't want to say more evil, so I'll say less humane.

00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:23,280
We've got timed code tests or timed coding environments.

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,849
If you've never had to do one of these it's because you work at rational

00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:28,674
places and don't interview it terrible.

00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:34,050
And I, hope it doesn't feel like I'm picking on just these three, because there

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,940
are dozens of companies that offer these.

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,490
But these are folks that build off the shelf time code tests

00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,050
for when you apply for a job.

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,710
This is the kind of exercise I'm thinking about.

00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,910
This is a, they say assessment, it's a test, but I use this an example

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,940
alongside hackathons to say, we do have models within tech for us having.

00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,820
Learning style experiences around writing code.

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,079
How would our experience change and what kinds of things could we do

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,360
to shift these around reading code?

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,560
We already have some, we've talked about the well-established models

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,130
in tech, around writing code socially and individually outside

00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,720
of a professional experience.

00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,350
Outside of tech.

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,340
We do already have these established models to choose from for reading,

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,600
reading circles and reading clubs and other social groups around learning

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,330
have existed far longer than you or I.

00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:35,955
I'm really excited around the idea of what would happen if we took these models and

00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,085
applied them to better understanding code.

00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:42,555
While I was looking at this problem while I was thinking around it, I ran

00:17:42,555 --> 00:17:48,165
into some brilliant people who are just out there, apparently psychic and trying

00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:50,145
to solve all of my worries for me.

00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:53,264
So Felina, who's a fabulous professor and.

00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:54,975
Absolutely brilliant as well.

00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:58,965
I believe also a professor started a code reading club, a reading

00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:05,025
circle of sorts for code, and this is really intentionally designed.

00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:09,855
So this is a I believe an eight part meetup series that has all

00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:10,935
of them are learning materials.

00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:13,155
They have the code ready, they have the exercise ready.

00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:17,475
They have the lesson plans ready, and you can bring this into your workplace.

00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:19,155
You can bring this into your academic setting.

00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:19,985
If you've got.

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,030
If your friends are very much like me, which I, good.

00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,980
Good for you being friends with weirdos.

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,400
If your friends are really into the idea of like, oh, what would it be?

00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:36,320
What it means for our understanding to more closely examine, you can run these

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,900
yourself just based on their lesson plans.

00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,290
They're out of the box and go, I'm so excited that these.

00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:48,064
A sort of adjacent plug is one of the originators of the code reading.

00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:50,824
Meet-ups also wrote this very, good book.

00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:54,965
That's just come out about cognition and how our brains work

00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:56,524
and want to work in programming.

00:18:57,064 --> 00:19:01,205
It's not exclusively around reading and code and I don't get

00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,584
a kickback for it or anything.

00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:06,155
I just found this personally very enjoyable and useful.

00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:08,435
I confess that I'm trying to sell you.

00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,899
On the focus of reading code partially out of a good old fashioned

00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:17,459
nerdy love of reading, but reading better and reading more mindfully

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,100
offers us real practical benefits.

00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:25,590
The goal behind us reading, writing about or talking about code is really

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,360
the synthesis of shared understanding.

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,060
Any of us with enough experience have worked on a project that doesn't have

00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,240
any shared understanding if you're brand new to the industry or you're

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,230
just getting into the industry.

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,360
Maybe you haven't experienced that yet.

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,230
Oh, in which case I have got some, bad news.

00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,409
My love it's going to happen eventually and it's going to be miserable.

00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:52,075
But how could better reading practices around code make us as individuals more

00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:57,294
resilient, these projects without shared understanding and how could reading,

00:19:57,325 --> 00:20:03,955
driving our own understanding, be better pooled to create shared understanding and,

00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:06,445
sort of prevent these doom like projects.

00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,430
I want to take you way, way back.

00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:15,200
And I want to talk to you really briefly about the four core language skills.

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,660
And these are something we talk about sort of in really, early education.

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,970
So you would have started doing these well before you entered any kind of school.

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,880
And these are listed out in the order.

00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:33,330
In which we generally learn to do them in our home language, our first language.

00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,120
So we, generally listen before we speak.

00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,480
Yeah.

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:36,930
Right.

00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,760
And then our reading skills develop more quickly than our writing skills.

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:48,870
Also fair knowing this, and having looked at our bias and technology

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,970
for sort of hands on keyboards.

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,330
I feel that we're doing ourselves a disservice in skills development.

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,480
We know that our passive skills develop before our active skills in human

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,510
languages and the way we interact with human language, I would politely,

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:13,640
but gently argue that in programming languages, in technical language

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,820
work, that there's a great potential.

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,890
There's a great benefit to be had.

00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,140
By developing these passive skills.

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,330
And I want to very gently, I suppose, workshop out with

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,710
you if that's not a bit rough.

00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,410
I want to sort of workshop.

00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,800
A proposal for four core skills that would enable us to focus

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,790
on these passive skills and then translate them into active skills.

00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,910
And I confess that my thinking about this as really early, I'm a terrible

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,740
speaker and a terrible person.

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,600
And I've joined you in large part because a lot of you are a lot smarter than I

00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,300
am, and I genuinely want your opinion.

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,860
So here are my to be amended for core skills for technical work?

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:10,340
I think the first one you're going to be doing is reading code of some kind

00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,020
that may be embedded within editorial.

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,540
And we've been talking about it a lot during this talk.

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,160
We can just go ahead and yeah, we've got reading code and I think

00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,300
you're going to be writing code.

00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,050
And I think that most folks I'm talking to are going to be like yeah, I get it, Jess.

00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:29,445
And look at what an absolutely clunky way I've chosen to say this.

00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:32,555
Like, please help me if you have a better way to say this, but here are,

00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:38,345
these are any activities where you're actively taking in information about

00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:41,285
the code base or information about the technical problems or information

00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:45,065
about the technical domain that isn't directly from the code base.

00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:48,065
This could be reading documentation, taking online

00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:49,865
course, listening to a coworker.

00:22:49,865 --> 00:22:50,765
Describe the problem.

00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,650
And the next one still clunky, but it's going to make a lot of sense.

00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,320
This is active non code communication.

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,140
It's where you're saying the thing or writing the thing.

00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,400
If you are one of the few and beautiful, chosen few who loves to

00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,340
write documentation that's, this, it could be streaming, which would be

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,760
a, if you're live streaming yourself.

00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,070
Coding.

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,580
That could be a really interesting combination of you reading code.

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,650
Cause you've got to read it while you write it writing code and then actively

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,540
engaging in non code communication.

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:29,330
So talking about what you're doing as you're doing it, I suppose if

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,030
you're reading the chat, it's also passive non code communication.

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,620
How exhausting or, making a video or talking to your coworkers would

00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,000
count as one of these as well.

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,040
All of these, all of this sort of.

00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:46,335
Different approaches and academic joyous, fluff, I think.

00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:46,965
Yeah.

00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:51,165
If we take ourselves too seriously, we've gone a bit off off there, but

00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:56,324
all of this, I'm really trying to bring myself and bring all of us

00:23:57,165 --> 00:24:01,164
to my big goofy dream, everybody.

00:24:02,865 --> 00:24:06,885
Has a weird dream billionaires want us to go to Mars?

00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:08,685
Precocious children want puppies.

00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:11,505
Most of us have a big goal somewhere in us.

00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:17,445
My big weird goal is continuous understanding.

00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:26,925
What would it mean to have an environment where you're constantly reading constantly

00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:30,015
learning and constantly adding to.

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,910
Yeah, what's possible for you to understand.

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,950
And for me, continuous understanding, isn't just, I want

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,240
to continuously understand this.

00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,100
I want to continually add this in.

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:49,350
As you're learning as you're reading and of course, writing that you're generating

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,759
artifacts of understanding as you go.

00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,620
It's a very specific, very weird dream.

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,180
And one that I confess that I stole the language from my employer, the ability

00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,740
to have this sort of true north in what would it look like in education or what

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,300
would it look like in collaboration for ongoing shared understanding to

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,880
be the goal is weird but magical.

00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,350
This has been a little bit teacher.

00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,695
So let's talk homework.

00:25:18,405 --> 00:25:21,465
I'm not your boss and I'm not your mom and I'm not your teacher.

00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:23,505
I can't make you do anything.

00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:26,994
And I don't think I'd be much inclined to try.

00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:32,265
So this is more of a gentle invitation than actual homework for any folks

00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:33,435
interested in trying this out.

00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:37,155
The easy stuff is, Hey, try to intentionally think about

00:25:37,155 --> 00:25:38,385
reading code during your day.

00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,415
So if you find yourself doing intensively, but oh wow, cool.

00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:46,315
I'm doing some intensive reading and try to identify when you're using

00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:51,355
different skills around understanding and reading at selfishly, especially

00:25:51,355 --> 00:25:54,775
if they're ones I haven't thought of, if you're like, oh, I don't have a

00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:57,565
word for this, but I often do this.

00:25:57,565 --> 00:25:59,395
Or I often do that with reading code.

00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:00,235
Yeah.

00:26:00,265 --> 00:26:04,945
Identifying the skills, identifying the approaches seems so valuable

00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:06,805
around intentionality and reading.

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,240
If you don't mind, if it's a bother, please try one of the reading techniques.

00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,290
I've outlined here.

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,879
I'd love to hear whether or not yeah.

00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,629
How, applicable and how valuable you find them.

00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,149
Because I've mostly just been torturing my team with them.

00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,370
It's not my project, but I love it.

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,850
If you've got the time and interest, please check out one of the code reading

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,965
workshops from code reading.org I believe.

00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:35,294
And most selfishly please, I beg you bring me back.

00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:38,115
Any feedback you're comfortable with, you could come back and be like,

00:26:38,115 --> 00:26:41,595
Jess, I tried some of these reading techniques and they're rubbish.

00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,185
I'll be like, no, thank you.

00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:45,165
This is still really valuable information.

00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:51,554
And because ongoing education, ongoing learning is a two way street.

00:26:52,304 --> 00:26:53,205
I've also got homework.

00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,982
Coming out of this talk and coming out of future, work my homework

00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:03,900
for, me, for everyone, for the I was about to be a bit grand.

00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,730
Oh, my homework for the wider tech community.

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,510
Like, nah, my homework for me is to continue to read about and understand.

00:27:11,105 --> 00:27:15,754
Teach about where I can reading and code and if, and when folks are

00:27:15,754 --> 00:27:18,995
lovely enough to give me feedback, I promise to continue to integrate them

00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:20,254
into my understanding and feedback.

00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:23,645
And I promise to keep working on building tooling, around

00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:24,905
reading and understanding code.

00:27:26,585 --> 00:27:28,585
I did mention that I work at codesee.

00:27:29,085 --> 00:27:32,085
As a very, short and shameless plug, we are in beta.

00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:35,985
So we're still working on some tooling to help people read and

00:27:36,035 --> 00:27:39,075
understand, JavaScript code basis.

00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:41,925
I'm such a big nerd about feedback.

00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:45,495
If anybody wanted to test this out I'm super...

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,500
My boss, isn't looking, I can, yeah!

00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,870
I'll give y'all access.

00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:52,490
I'm super happy to give you free beta access.

00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,090
It's free.

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,950
Money-wise but I will lightly tax you by politely asking you with feedback.

00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,666
If you do try it out.

00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:06,507
If you did want to try that or give me feedback you find me at jess@codesee.org.

00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:13,685
Because I'm a big old nerd I've gone ahead and sourced, source out where all

00:28:13,685 --> 00:28:15,905
my illustrations and diagrams come from.

00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:20,255
And also where you can learn more about the different concepts listed here.

00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:21,545
Fabulous.

00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:23,435
