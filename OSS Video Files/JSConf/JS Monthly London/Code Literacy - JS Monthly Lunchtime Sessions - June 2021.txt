Code Literacy
Jessica Rose

As programmers think about our own work with code, we place an incredible emphasis on the act of production. We focus on the act of writing code as if writing and often present it as the primary way we expect to interact with a codebase.

This talk will approach codebases as living texts and explore the value of re-examining the twin skills of reading and understanding codebases. Weâ€™ll look at linguistics and literacy concepts that give us new ways to conceptualize how we read code, as well as software-specific tools and approaches we can use to further our reading skills.
