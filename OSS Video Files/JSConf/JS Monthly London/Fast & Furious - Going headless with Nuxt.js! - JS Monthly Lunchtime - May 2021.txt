Fast & Furious - Going headless with Nuxt.js! // Samuel Snopko

This will be fast & furious! I will show you the fastest possible way to connect your Nuxt.js (Vue.js) project to the headless CMS and deploy it in seconds. You should know a thing or two about Nuxt.js, headless CMS in general or JAMstack as there will be no time to describe the concepts in detail. In the end, you will be furious at how insanely good the JAMstack is!

hi everybody thank you for the world

00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,160
harris and

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,000
yeah the event the london the city.js

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,800
conference in london like even it was

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,480
online was really

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,719
nice and i can encourage you to check it

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,120
out so if you never heard about or

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,240
you never saw it so there was like a few

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,720
pretty awesome talks and

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,279
even the the online video was very very

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,119
cool

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,880
but let's back to the my talk and why

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,519
i'm here today so as

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,920
a result my name is samuel snopko and i

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,599
am going to talk today about the nakjas

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,439
and how we are going to build

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
basically a website from a scratch with

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,640
a headless solution

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,480
and uh headless solution will be the

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,640
storyblock in this case and it will be

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,719
fast and furious so probably if you know

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,239
i think uh or one or two things about

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,840
the nexus it will help you

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,079
but even if you don't know anything

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,840
about the next it's okay because

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,280
it's a javascript framework and you

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,719
should be able to understand everything

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,239
what i will be showing

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,000
so first flight uh of course is

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,239
something about me so who i am

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
i am the my name is already like on the

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,559
screen and i stole it

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,520
i'm the head of the developer relations

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,040
at storyblock

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,119
and i'm also like big community believer

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,240
and i was like working on living in

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,320
germany helping

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,400
to different communities and like also

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,400
the meetups and then also like kind of a

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
max jazz so i'm like kind of ambassador

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,479
of the night jazz i'm big fan of it

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,159
and why i think like ended where i'm

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,320
ended it's also like

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,000
always like doing a front end and i was

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,439
very very interesting into the designer

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
so bridging the gap between the

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,880
developers and the designers

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
and i think like with the headless

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,640
approach and atomic

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,400
design which is also like part of the

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
headless decoupled approach

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,000
is the reason why i'm where i'm in at

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,320
the moment but that's enough

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
about me let's jump to the top we are

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,600
not going to do

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,520
a lot with a lot of slides we are going

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
to just go for light coding if you want

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,200
to follow me

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,399
uh and if you want to follow what i am

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,720
going to do

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,600
uh we can follow this github link here

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000
at storyblock

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,840
slash talk blazingly fast the next i

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,159
just updated it like few minutes ago

00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
with

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,920
latest uh release from the storyblock

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,920
next bridge so this is the first time

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,799
you will also be able to see the version

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,399
do

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,679
in the preview or in the talk so how to

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,560
start with a nike js that's the first

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,480
big question

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,480
that everybody should ask and i'm also

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,480
answering like use uh the yarn create

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,200
next step or npm create the knack as

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,800
next step

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,560
you can build your own like starting

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,080
point or like starting scenarios but

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,760
this is the best way you can do

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,440
because like uh the next and all the

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,239
modern technologies are developing so

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,920
fast that

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,760
they have like every time like new

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,000
versions and you just

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,879
can't get uh you cannot be all the like

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,560
on the edge

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,760
so here you just like choose your name

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
i'm still going to forget about

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,879
javascript

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,000
and then package manager will be like

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,560
yarn in this case

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,640
and i'm going for a tailwind so let's

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,640
choose talent

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,840
of course we will need axios which is

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,680
already installed on axiorys

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,599
of course needed for the communication

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,640
between the storyboard the headless cms

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,920
and the next so i'm going to choose that

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,239
at this moment we are not going to

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,920
choose any lending tools because

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,599
it's for the purpose of this talk it

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,480
will be like just making everything more

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,800
complicated

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,319
so no testing also we are of course

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,519
going for the server side running

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,720
or servers or static site generation so

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,959
universal in this case

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,400
and i would uh go for and recommend you

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,040
for go for the champs deck

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,760
or if you want to do the deploy to

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,000
versailles netlify or any other

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,280
third-party services as i am using the

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,120
ps code i'm also

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,480
going to use a chase config and after

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,640
this setup

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,400
and adding also like your github name

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,000
and basically control system

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,879
you will be your you will be added or

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,200
like get it

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,360
to the project like this so here is

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,920
exactly what i did

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,920
is the the next step is this uh

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,680
repository here in this repository i

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,280
already started the yarndev so you can

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,280
see it's my local hose running

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,480
and then all this i do just because i

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,400
want to save some time

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,920
because otherwise this presentation will

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
be even more than 40 minutes

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,360
first of all what we should do is check

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,439
out our localhost so let's check

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
out if everything is running okay on the

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,599
localhost and as you can see here i see

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,840
my welcome screen from the localhost

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,280
and basically my application is ready to

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,400
be deployed to the

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,680
netlify or reversal so i can just start

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
deploying if you would like to

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,640
but of course this is just a static

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,439
website that is built directly in the

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,280
nexus

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,799
here in the index.js and this is

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,440
basically the welcome screen from the

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,959
next team

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,360
where you can go to documentation on

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,400
github so what else what is the next

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,560
step we need to do

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,000
the next step we need to do is basically

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,320
going to storybook and somewhere

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,320
create our content so and the question

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,000
is like how we can create the content

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,600
so we are going to use a storyblock in

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720
this case and i'm going to create

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,400
everything from scratch so

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,160
let's imagine that i just registered a

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,759
storyblock and i have a new account here

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,000
and i want to create a fresh new space

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,360
so

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
i'm just clicking on the create new

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,840
space i'm choosing a new space and then

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,720
i'm just adding here as some name

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,280
so just to don't do a lot of typos i'm

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,280
just

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,440
will be copying a lot of stuff from my

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
cheat sheet on the left side

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,520
and here you can see that i'm just

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,160
creating a new project

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
and of course i have reached the limit

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,680
of all of these lines so this is the

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,520
because i have like too many demos

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
so give me a second i just in live

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,720
screen live stream i will

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,240
remove one demo space and then i can

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
create a new one again

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,160
in this case i have here also the tote

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,840
basically fast the neck jazz

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,199
so here you can see that i just entered

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,680
the next space

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,479
that's the space of my project and in

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,400
this project

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,840
you can see that i have some options of

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,880
course one of the options is that i can

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,479
go to the content

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,320
where you can already see the final

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,960
stage of the project that i would be

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,919
building

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,440
before your eyes but as uh we cannot i

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,440
cannot create a fresh space at the

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,840
moment i have to do this

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,479
so now here in the home if i click on

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,320
the home

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,720
i'm entering the empty space and i am

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,240
i see here also my local host and why do

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,080
i see here the local host

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,919
is because i already connected my

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,639
localhost is this

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,919
in this paragraph space so how does it

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,800
exactly work

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,319
so here in the settings the first thing

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,960
you have to understand is like if i

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,800
remove

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,160
this localhost environment then i will

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,240
see nothing here

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,199
so let's change this student to the

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,319
empty url

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:16,160
or just do a google url

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,400
that we kind of fresh start

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,479
let's go to the content and show you

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
that here is a iframe where i can show

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,039
at the

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,720
different pages at the moment i am not

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,319
showing any page and why i am not

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,120
streaming any page is that i want to

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,240
recreate

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,919
the whole the whole experience for you

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,560
from the fresh start

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,479
so what is the next step the next step

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,919
and i'm now a little bit improvising i'm

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,319
looking what i should show you

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,400
is to preview a sample content so the

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,160
sample content here on the home page is

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,000
i could see here on the right hand side

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,080
i have a teaser and grid

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
and this is the visual part so here in

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,919
the teaser i can start editing my

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,560
content so i have a hello world i can do

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,840
like

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,919
hello js monthly

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,840
monthly i can go back i can also like to

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,759
change the features in my grid but i

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,199
don't see any pro in my visual editor so

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,400
theoretically i could like hide also the

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,039
visual editor and just

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,919
enjoy just the forward of my of my

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,680
website

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,680
i could also like already like save this

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,240
content and i could already publish this

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
content

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,240
so i would get like draft jsons or

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,360
publish json that are available to be

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,360
through the api so in this case

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,280
if i would open like the draft.json you

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,840
can see the draft content

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,840
of your space or of your project that

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,880
you would get and the according to this

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,479
content you are able to use netflix or

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,440
any other framework to render your

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,199
website pretty simple i think

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,560
so and this is i also like i think it's

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,360
quite straightforward

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
so what i did now that i make this

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,039
working so

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,759
i don't get here like just a random uh

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,080
error so what i need to do here is like

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,000
go

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,240
to my local host and i want to show

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,240
their alcohol so i have a localhost

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,120
and to show the locals which you already

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,919
like show so it's just i need to go to

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,840
my settings

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,120
and change the preview environment here

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,000
to localhost

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,560
and the localhost this can be any locat

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,039
any

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,039
url i can even also create like multiple

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,919
private urls so here i could like have

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,039
like development

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,039
location and i could also have a

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,440
production

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,120
so like this and now if i save it by

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,400
default i should be

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,000
i should see the content of the

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,840
localhost but this could be also like

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,280
the netlify or virtual url

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,760
and then if i go here to the home page

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,560
i see my localhost right this makes

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,240
sense but

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,240
there is also one catch i'm always

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,760
showing is that i'm here already

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,839
overriding something because

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,200
i have here this real path and if we

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,320
remove this real part which is

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,720
just overwrite for my home page

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,440
that i should get also like error here

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,760
but as

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,880
at the moment you can see that i am

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,839
getting still the whole

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,600
if i open it now i get a next error and

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,279
why i'm getting this next error and this

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,200
is also like important if you are trying

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,200
to recreate what i am doing today

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,959
is that here the next gs at the moment

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
doesn't know the slack home

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,200
so i will get to that also in a second

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,160
because in the next project i have only

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,480
index.view

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,279
so basically that's the empty slash so

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,360
that's why

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,360
we have a way to override a visual

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,120
editor and to override the visual editor

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,160
you can change here the real path

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,560
to the slash because the home

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,160
should be always like name somehow so if

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,360
now i reload i should see

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
my local host i see my local host and

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,320
why

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,920
there is a name home is that because in

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,200
the next chess if i would like to

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,600
require

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,080
request this content i need to ask like

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,120
hey give me the content of the home

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,600
great so let's at the moment as you can

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,760
see

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,640
we have a content here which i can get

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,880
through the json

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,320
or rest api or graphql but in the case

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
of nexus we are going to use the rest

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,240
api

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,880
and we already also integrated that we

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,640
have

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,240
our preview so we don't need to have a

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,480
special localhost tab here

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,240
because we see our localhost directly in

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,959
the storyblock app

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,959
right but we still don't see what

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,399
exactly is that so we don't spray

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,720
the content from the right hand side

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,040
from the content editor

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,959
to do that we need to do a one a small

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,040
thing so we need to install

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,880
a packages i already installed them but

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,760
to make it easy for you

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,279
i just show you to it or also so what do

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,519
we need to install is the

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:31,920
yarn storyblock next module so it's like

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,640
yarn at storyblock next and the

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,360
storyblock

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
next module will it's already created by

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,800
the storyblock team

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,560
and this is also like updated like two

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,000
weeks ago so we have like newest version

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,519
like major update

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,959
and we are updating all of our tutorials

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,480
at the moment so some of them still are

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,360
using the version number one

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,360
so and now if i go to yarndev i can

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,000
start also my project so what's happened

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
here

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,440
is that it was added to the package.json

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,760
my storyblock nooks

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,440
2.01 and then of course if i go to the

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,160
config of the star

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,519
nokia nexus i can also use the

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,200
storyblock max module

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,279
and i can use the storyblock next module

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,360
to connect next

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,560
project to the storyblock so here in the

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,120
modules i

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,600
am going to uncomment this code where i

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,600
am like

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,880
configuring the storyboard next module

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,360
and as you can see here

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,720
i need my aster block space token to

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,120
access my data

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,519
so let's get the story block space token

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,200
so to get a special space token

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,519
i need to go to the settings of my space

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,680
and here in the api keys i can see that

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,360
this is my preview token so the pro

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,040
going to give you the draft version of

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,640
the data but you of course can also

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,399
create a public token which would give

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,880
you the published uh data

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,560
and you can create uh so many tokens and

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,160
as you need and you can also like this

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,600
way create the tokens for different

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
different environments like if you're

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,160
like redesigning environments or stuff

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,399
like that

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,160
and to keep track where and which is

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,200
where uh used

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,320
so let's copy this token and let's go

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,160
back to the next

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,560
so i'm going to add it directly to the

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,279
config.js but i'm not recommending to do

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,000
it

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,959
in your projects anytime soon because if

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,600
you would do this

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,720
it's also like published or like it's

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,560
going to do your git

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,399
uh repository and then everybody will

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,320
like see it so use that and

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,000
a file for that as i have here so if i

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,079
would open a button file

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,600
i would save my server token of course

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,360
here and then

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
i would load it directly as this is

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,399
recommended by the next

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,639
and then also we can save it in netlify

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,600
or in the very versa and use it as it

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,120
should be a used and secured way i kind

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,240
of connected the story block

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,240
with the with the neck jazz

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
but if i go to the content and open the

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,120
home i still see

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,800
only the index index page

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,560
and the original one so i still don't

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,560
see my content so if you see the here

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,079
the teaser there is like hello js

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,920
monthly and i don't see that

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,279
and even here in the grid i have a

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,200
features and i also

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,560
don't see those features what i need to

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,399
do is today

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,639
is to create a component because you can

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,360
see here on this page which is a custom

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,320
page

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,240
created by me for just this demo and i

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,720
have a attribute called volley which

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,560
contains some components and i can see

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,000
all of my components in the component

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,240
section of the story block

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
so here are the components i see that i

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,079
have already article created

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,000
i created even a new component so not

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,040
only the default one which is pager

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,600
hd the grid and feature but also i have

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,279
article and featured articles let's

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,160
forget for some time the article and

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,000
featured article

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,240
and focus on the basic ones so here

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,760
we have a teaser which contains only a

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,800
headline and it's tight text

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,880
so no special nothing special just

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,240
a component called teaser which have one

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,720
property or one field

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,000
uh headline and you can fry the text art

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,480
and i have a feature which

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,480
is also here just a component called

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,360
feature with one property or one field

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,920
called name

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,839
with type text then i have here a

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,600
special component called great

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,320
or like special it's not a special

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,519
component the component with the special

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,560
field columns this is also the name of

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,880
the field

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,079
and the type of this field is a blocks

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,600
and blocks means that

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,519
you can nest or use in this field

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,639
any other components any other nest

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,560
stable components

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,680
because in story block as you could see

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,440
already we

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,600
we have two type of the components the

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,199
one are the content types

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,440
the second one are the next stable

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,880
components so the next stable components

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,600
are basically the components that can be

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,639
nested in

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,839
other nest table components or other

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,320
content types

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,079
using the special field type blocks as

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,880
you can see on this grid so here

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,000
i can have a field called columns which

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,880
is types of blocks

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,920
i can and i can nest here any other nice

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,040
table component

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,959
but i can set also some some rules like

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,040
allow only specific components to be

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,560
inserted and i want to allow here

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,160
to be added only the features for

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,959
example and then i would just save the

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,880
schema of

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,000
my component and then i just edit the

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,720
component and then

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,079
i have content types and by i need at

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
least one content type to create a

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,040
content

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,399
because i need to create entries or

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,440
stories how to call them in the

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,920
storyblock

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,760
so here in the page is a content type

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,800
and the typical content types are like

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,279
article page

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,600
outdoor page uh landing page home page

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,160
etc so it's like types of the pages

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,920
but it doesn't have to be always a type

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,000
of the page it can be of something that

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,600
is not represented by a website

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,199
so for example author that is a

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,399
reference on different

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,399
articles and here this page is using the

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,920
same approach as the grid so here i have

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,079
a special field called body

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,040
because we have a body on every website

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,680
or every page

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,920
and it's type blocks and i can use their

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,000
grids these are our featured articles

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,120
so let's remove the our feature articles

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,320
for now

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,759
just keep it a little bit fresh

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,320
and now i set up basically my structure

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,639
so

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,000
if i go to the content and open the home

00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,600
i can click add a block

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,920
and i can see that i can choose from the

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,320
grid and teaser to create something new

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,600
i can even like select my teaser i can

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,839
duplicate it

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,759
and i can do this stuff but i still

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,399
don't see the prairie

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,360
and i want to see that prior so so what

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,040
i need to do

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,199
is that i'm without delivering the

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,839
content through the json api

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,720
uh sorry rest api and that you can see

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,880
it also here

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,920
that i'm delivering like a body which i

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,160
already explained

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,079
which is a array of a component so here

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,519
is one first component and there is like

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,839
second one or

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,519
list of blocks and the first one is a

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,079
component type teaser with the text

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,560
headline

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,480
js monthly so exactly what you see here

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,600
a text hello.js monthly

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,920
and this is the teaser in the page great

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,680
but

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,920
we don't have that same thing in the

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,279
next gs so i didn't grade in my

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,639
component still and then i just and

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,959
that's the reason why i cannot render

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,360
them

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,880
so it's quite logical so let's do that

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,040
in the next chess

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,720
so what i need to do now is just go to

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,839
the components folder and show you that

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,399
i have those folder

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,279
components here so you can see here i

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,559
have a teaser

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,360
teaser component which is very simple

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,480
for the viewer so i'm just expecting a

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,120
prop called block

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
which is object and using this block

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,480
prop

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,199
i will get all my data that i want to

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,799
render

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,439
here i'm just using a little bit tail

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,559
installing to basically style

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,919
h2 with i'm going to render my headline

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,760
so block dot headline

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,880
and this is how i am going to get the

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:32,320
content the same goes for the feature

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,640
so i have basically a simple block pro

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,760
where i have i'm expecting block and

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,640
then i have a very

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,360
simple div which where i'm going to

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,600
render a h2 with the name

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,559
the grid is words get a little bit more

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,400
complicated

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,919
because i'm still getting my data to the

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,799
blog but in this case i don't know what

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,080
is the content

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,720
what components i added to the grid

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,360
so and because of that i am rendering a

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,039
list

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,280
under the list of items or list items

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,320
and these list items can be a different

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,440
dynamic

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,760
components in the view we have uh this

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,600
dynamic component which you can be used

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,799
and all you need to do is use this

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,919
special attribute

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,440
is and where if this is equal a teaser

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,320
you'll render a teaser because i have

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,000
here the teaser

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,440
if this would be a cool the feature then

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,760
you will already draw a feature

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,760
so what is this blog.component exactly

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,720
what i showed you already in the publish

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,520
json here

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,960
that this is the this obj this is the

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,440
object block basically

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
and here this component equal teaser is

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,559
what will be the block dot

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,799
component so here the block dot

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,679
component will return exactly this value

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,679
through

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,960
and then i know that i should render a

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,039
teaser

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,880
and then i also send down the stream all

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,760
the other content

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,320
so okay that's doing the grid and almost

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,640
the same

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,480
approach as for the page where i am also

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,240
like dynamically rendering

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,559
the body so here you can see that i'm

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,280
looping through the body so i'm looped

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,320
through the block

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,960
dot body where i'm all i have order of

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,960
all my components on the

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,160
page and i'm just rendering them

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,480
straight forward

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,520
quite easy so what i need to do is of

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,360
course

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,720
all of my components here are basically

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,200
dynamic so i

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,840
have to tell the nakjas to what

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,280
component

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,280
i will be rendering so i have i cannot

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,120
cannot use the components true which is

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,600
one of the basic uh features of the

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,640
next error right now but i have to like

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,559
literally say tonight

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,679
just hey expect that i will be rendering

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,360
these components

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,720
and that i will be doing using the

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,240
plugin so like

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,520
the simplest way uh there's like

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,200
multiple ways how to do this but the

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,600
simplest way you can do it is

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,799
using the plugin in the next and it's uh

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,799
you just create a file called

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,799
component.js

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,559
where you import and register your

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,280
component so here you can see

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,400
i am importing all of my components that

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,720
i just explained

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,960
and also like i'm registered in the view

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,679
that view knows that okay i need to

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,440
render these components and the last

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,919
thing i need to do is going to the next

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,159
config and also like

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,360
like load this plugin so here in the

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,400
plugins if i

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,880
scroll up i should uncomment this line

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,760
save it and i need to wait a little bit

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,799
that

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:18,000
this project will be rebuilt and then we

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,400
could and should see also like update so

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,440
close

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:25,120
this let's see reload

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,240
here and let's wait a second

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,360
see if it's it's already built and

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,200
is there any update and the answer is no

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,720
there's no idea and maybe some of you

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,880
already noticed that there is like makes

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,799
sense right we don't see any update here

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,000
and it's easy i register all the

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,679
components i

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,760
show you how to do how what are the

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,600
components doing but i didn't load the

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,240
data in the next

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,799
so what i am talking about so here we

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,840
right now

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:55,200
see a index page and this index page

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,799
here in the view it has this code

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,640
and there's we didn't change never this

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,240
code so we never loaded anything from

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,159
the storyboard we just connected it

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,039
but we never said like hey i need the

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,400
content of the index page or of the home

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,720
so what do we need to do now is

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,480
basically remove all this original call

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,679
from the next team

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,440
so here this code i just remove this

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,799
and then i don't need to anymore show

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,120
the next logo

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,960
so i'm going to also remove this i'm

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,919
going to uncomment my code

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,320
which i will get back a second to to

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,480
tell

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,480
you something about that and then i need

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,799
to save it so that's it

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,559
so what i did here is like okay i don't

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,640
know like what kind of content type i'm

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,640
going to render so here i have a dynamic

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,559
i could replace it directly by the page

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,880
but if i would have like multiple com

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,840
content types then i i need to like

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,679
decide that

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,880
so here you can like story dot content

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,480
component should tell me

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,120
which content type i'm using at the

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,159
moment so if i go here to the publish

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,039
json

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,480
and on the bottom we should see a page

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,720
so this is the page so

00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:02,240
the story so if i close now

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,480
now with this body then i have the story

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,440
content component as exactly story

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,480
content component

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,159
returns the page and i'm rendering this

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,799
page where are you here this page

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,200
then what i'm doing here in the script

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,000
part

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,720
of the story block is that i'm going to

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,880
prepare

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,400
my content so kind of like fake data

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,480
just empty story

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,400
and then i'm going to load the data

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,240
so i am going to load the data choosing

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,400
the asynchronous

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,760
asynchronous function at the moment and

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,320
here you can see that

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,039
i am already having something installed

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,200
on my

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,080
story block using the storyblock next

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,280
module and

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,600
on the app i have a story story api so i

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,600
now can ask using the story api for a

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,000
different content from the storyblock

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,880
so here i am saying like hey please get

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,080
me

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,120
the the home story of my api

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,520
sorry of my content so what is this

00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,840
whole

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,880
so this home is basically if i go back

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,559
to the story block

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,240
is it from this content you can see that

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,960
this is named a

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,799
story called home with a slug home so

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,240
i'm requesting this home

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,400
this is something that i do at the

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,520
moment aesthetically i'm asking for a

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,360
draft version

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,360
and i will get back to the rest of

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,039
relation in second

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,640
of course this is something you wouldn't

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,240
do in the real project

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,919
in a real project you would like find

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
out through the that

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,039
what is the false lag or the slack that

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,080
you want to request

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,799
using the context of the star of the

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,880
path

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,320
so from the context you can get a part

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,400
of your current

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,039
website and using that part you know

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,640
like okay i want to get maybe an article

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,559
number one from the blog

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,400
folder you also like sometimes want to

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,360
have a draft version and sometimes a

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,840
production version

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,520
so they're simple to decide like depends

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,640
on the architecture you choose and how

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,400
you build your project

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,720
but the simplest way is basically to

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,440
decide uh from the context if you are

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,480
like in the dev mode in the next or not

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,880
so here you can see like i am in the in

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
the

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,159
dev mode i'm asking for draft version

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,720
and if not then i'm asking for published

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,400
right so here i'm just always asking for

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,080
draft division and always statically for

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,320
the hub

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,120
great so if i now save it and open the

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,320
home

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,840
then i see live pro i see my pro

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,400
i see my content i i and it's

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,600
showing exactly what i have here but we

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,520
can do it better

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,520
because we have a modern modern

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,520
framework and we would like to have to

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,000
redeploy basically rebuild my website

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,440
all the time

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,840
i want to see a preview of the new

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,880
content so and to prevent this

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,080
we have also an event using the

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,720
storyblock next

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,600
we brought also the storyblock breach

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,720
and this the

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,480
storyblock bridge we can create

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,960
basically an instance of the story block

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,480
breach and

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,120
is this correctly wrote hopefully yes

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,600
so where i am going to listen for input

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,320
event and publish event

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,400
and change events so if i save this and

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,640
wait if everything is recompiled

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,120
in a second yeah it should work

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,080
and reload this then you see all i

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,159
already

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,279
outlined here so as i'm like moving my

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,400
arrow uh

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,360
your mouse you see outline and now the

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,360
story block

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,120
is even able to identify which

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,840
components represent on your website

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,400
because this is your

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,039
website on localhost in the content

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,960
editor

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,200
and even if i'm using the container you

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,640
can see the outline of those features so

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,360
you're going to features then you see

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,760
that i have

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,440
even all like highlighting the features

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,880
and not only that if i click on the

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,520
hello js model here

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,000
then i am also opening the hello.js

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,440
monthly

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,720
here and i can start editing like

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,559
is this cool so i can

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,840
basically do a real-time editing without

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,159
hitting the save button here

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,880
i'll publish so not i'm not redeploying

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,720
anything

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,440
i just have the real time editing

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,720
experience i can do go here i can like

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,520
drag and drop the stuff

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,480
i can select the stuff and copy paste

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,360
the stuff

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,880
i can go here and copy paste like the

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,240
whole content

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,600
and sorry copy paste

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,600
add it here and then

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,159
additionally to that we have the latest

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,919
features we did is that if i now go

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,880
and click here on the for example on

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,240
this component here and move backwards

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,480
and i have also this context editing

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,960
basically where i can like choose what i

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,080
want to do or maybe like i want to

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,559
block after and then i just add a grid a

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,200
new

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,880
empty booth is added then i can like

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,679
accelerate the literary experience with

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,840
my content

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,440
and this experience uh is something

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,880
which all the content editor is looking

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,919
for because it's something that

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,960
you are almost into the page builder but

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,039
this is not a page builder

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,080
like this all the developers have all

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,840
the features they need

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,760
but the contenders are and the marketers

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,400
are happy that they can experiment

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,080
with their existing components and build

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,600
the new website very quickly they can

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,919
like pray with them

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,200
and then if they are happy with it they

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,440
just hit the same

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,960
and after that the component is safe and

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,480
then if the publish the web hook is

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,799
triggered and everything is deployed

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,960
and of course if as you see that this

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,360
doesn't work great on the mobile

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,039
then probably i should go a version back

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,679
so let's restore the original version

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,039
which was

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:28,000
much nicer so great but still

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,880
i didn't create anything fancy i just

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,159
showed you the

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,279
basic getting started i loaded something

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,840
and i render it i send it to the block

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,520
and now the question is like how uh

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,880
there are two questions like how

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,000
works this bridge so the bridge works

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,840
using the only in the drive mode because

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,960
we are adding into the draft json a

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,200
special

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,159
property and then of course what you

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,320
need to do in the

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,240
page and some of you may already notice

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,840
that is that we are adding the special

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,720
storyblock vadi table

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,399
uh block where we can links to this we

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,559
can identify the components

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,320
into your website and this is something

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,760
which already of course you will strip

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,279
away from the production so

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,279
the production will be still so

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,960
performant as always

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,880
all right let's create something let's

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,200
create something new let's create

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,360
a new component from a scratch because

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,480
we have still a little bit time and we

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,480
should create something like let's

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,880
create the article and what is the

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,159
the power of the headless cms in in

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,000
general also

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,320
because the power of the headless gm cm

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,279
is also that that you can create and

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,120
set up your your content without needing

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,360
to build anything in the front end

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,960
so here for example i would normally

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,960
create this from scratch but as

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,880
i wasn't able to create a new space here

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,240
i have an article and this article at

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,880
the moment

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,480
i already added there a hero image title

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,440
intro outer and pros

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,159
so the hero image is a asset of course

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,120
of type

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,039
image and no special rules that i have

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,720
here a title which is a simple text and

00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,919
we'll be using for title of the article

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,880
then i have an intro

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,600
where i will write my my intro text or

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,600
maybe a

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,720
text that will be shown some in some

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,600
teasers and then i have

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,120
outer where i have multiple options how

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
to choose out or you can reference them

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,080
from

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,760
existing fields or external sources but

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,320
now i choose this single option

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,279
or drop down and define my autos

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,799
directly here

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,240
as a source but and the last is of

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,960
course i have approached which i

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,640
choose a rich text editor and i could

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,399
like customize the toolbar

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,000
but i'm not going to do that because we

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,840
will anyway not use it so

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,440
this is what i create an article like

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,600
definition of an article which is a

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,720
content type

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,559
but i don't still have anything built in

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,720
the neck chest i don't have a

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,039
template in the neck js or like a

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,440
component called article

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,320
and so if you keep it in my normally i

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,080
would block

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,760
i couldn't like really create a new

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,679
stuff but here

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,360
i can just say to my content it's like

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,200
hey let's create a new folder for you so

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,760
i just created a new folder

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,120
called articles and you can start

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,600
editing the articles

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,799
because if i'm just going to create a

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,679
new article

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:12,240
so let's add a new article like article

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,480
number four probably

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,320
you can save it and a new article is

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,960
added but there is like no page to

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,440
preview

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,200
and for this reason exactly you can use

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,320
the form view so and now

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,559
i would be able to like upload my

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,080
like like let's choose some image i have

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,610
like your number

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,399
then i could like cool

00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:36,240
[Music]

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:38,640
cool title and let's add some text

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,640
something like

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,480
building uh your vue.js applications of

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,159
something from the neck jazz website

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,000
and i will be the author and normally

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,600
then i could also write here the pros

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,440
of course you could like build it also

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,279
from the different components but let's

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,480
imagine the simple solutions for the

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,600
article as this

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,120
now save it and i could publish and i

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,960
did basically the same for the other

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,720
articles so i hear the article number

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,519
four where i have some pictures with

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,000
some

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,480
text then i have here also the second

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,519
with some text etc

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,519
so okay i created the articles and now i

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,240
can already use those articles still

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,840
without any front-end because i can go

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,159
now to the homepage

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,519
and i could like love to feature those

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,120
articles down here

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,360
so how to feature them as they are

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,600
already featured here but let's imagine

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,919
i

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,120
don't didn't create this a feat special

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,919
feature here so

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,880
how to create it is is basically i would

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,200
go to component

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,919
and i would create a featured articles

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,039
component

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,440
and this featured articles component

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,080
would have a defined title so here you

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,559
can see like

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,159
in the title you can like rewrite the

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,360
title for example

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,399
but let's don't do that for now and then

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,480
we have option to reference stories

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,000
directly from storyblock where i said

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,080
like okay i want to

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,559
handpick a multiple articles that would

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,880
be featured on the homepage or in this

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,039
component and i want to choose only the

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,039
articles or restricts only to choose

00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,200
articles so it will be choose from

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:10,399
article folder and it will be stories

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,279
existing already in this space so great

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,399
i can do that now if i go to content and

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,120
open the home

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,000
i can already add i cannot add my

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,960
featured articles

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,960
because i of course didn't allow that so

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,799
now i need to go to the body

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,200
of the of the page of the content type

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,399
page i'm going to open and change the

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,480
schema of the body

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,000
because in the body i write labeled

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,640
authorizable

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,720
white listed only the grid and teaser so

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,679
now i'm going to allow also to add a

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,720
featured articles

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,880
i'm going to save it and now i can see

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,720
that i can add a featured article also

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,039
into my page

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,640
or it's better to say into my content

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,880
because it doesn't matter

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,960
you couldn't you could also use it to

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,159
generate not only a page but also like

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,279
an application or

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,039
mobile app so now here i would write

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,480
like probably like featured

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:07,360
articles as would be the title

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,240
on the website and now i just going to

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,640
choose

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,519
some of the articles let's choose this

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,840
three

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,360
so now i could like save it and i could

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,039
even like publish it but still i don't

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,640
see any preview because i didn't create

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,799
it still and in front and for it

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,080
and if i go to the publish json then i

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,600
see that here is like

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,799
added new content so here is the

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,279
featured articles component

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,480
ids of my articles and with the title

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,679
that i just

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,799
wrote great so this works so let's fix

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,640
the stuff on the store in the next so in

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,200
the next as you guys can guess

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,000
i already prepared so i just closed

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,399
these steps

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,519
that it's not confusing i already

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,399
created

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,840
a featured articles component and

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,159
featured rtx components

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,960
do the same thing as always so expect to

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,279
get some

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,159
content through the block property or

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,120
prop

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,039
and then renders a little bit more html

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,559
with little bit uh tailwind styling

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,440
where it renders a title right

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,320
added some uh yellow background and then

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,040
it's rendered

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,320
under the list of the article is a

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,280
component

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,679
so as we are sending and we are creating

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,480
from

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,119
our content type article we are going to

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,639
use it only to render article these

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,440
and then in this article teaser we're

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,599
just sending the article.content

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,599
as as the content because we are here

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,960
also looping through all of our articles

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,240
of blog.articles

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,159
so we are basically looping through this

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,599
where we have at the moment only write

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,399
this and i will tell you how to change

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,200
it to something

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,879
better than uids in a second and then we

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,159
just render the content together

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,960
so now i need to of course register my

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,359
components

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,960
so let's do that in the component.js in

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,240
plugins

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,879
and it should be already rebuilt and

00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,800
let's

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,720
look here and you already see like

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,720
previews of our articles

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,839
and we see picture we see also

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,480
storyblock

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,640
title and everything uh the text and

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,040
even the outdoors but we

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,800
didn't ask for that content and still i

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,320
didn't show you the content here so like

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,200
you can see also like the pictures a

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,599
little bit like

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,440
scale down or like cut it and that's

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,880
because like in the article t is a

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,960
component here

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,800
we you can see like we did the resizing

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,880
of the image so we even use the

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,760
storyblock image service to resize the

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,000
image to 320

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,920
and then we use it here to the image and

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,240
of course we render the title

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,800
intro and the outer and that was it it's

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,520
like nothing more complicated

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,440
and now i can do all the real-time

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,359
editing so i can like show only selected

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,040
like i can start reordering them

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,040
and you can see that this lady for

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,920
example on the bicycle

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,040
will now move on the last place so i can

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,520
like re-ordering

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,680
i can like select and select the first

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,960
one that the third one or like i can

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,079
select this fourth article

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,400
but that doesn't work so let's do this

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,000
and how does it work that the my ui this

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,240
is instead of sending the uids or

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,520
showing i am getting a real content

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,760
that's something i did in the

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,760
index page and the index page which you

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,240
could see this res overlays the resolve

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,920
the relations attribute this resolvation

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,480
attribute basically just say

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,079
uh to storyblock and if you are like

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,680
have a component called featured

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,280
articles and there is a

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,839
field called articles please don't send

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,880
me in the real time

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,680
in the real world the ui is send me the

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,119
content

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,200
so here we just say that to the

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,680
storyblock instance so like

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,440
that updates live updating and also i

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,320
did that here in the

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,800
asynchronous data request so the same

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,880
thing

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,400
and then i get a real content and the

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,880
power of this is that

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,520
now i have a featured artist's component

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,720
and but i can very simply copy it

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,280
add it here for example change the title

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,800
to

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,119
sam's article then i remove the first

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,880
story block is cool so that's if i'm

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,520
correct it's this one

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,680
and choose this and now i see basically

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,440
use i use the same component

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,680
and and i see only the same articles so

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,720
i can reuse it very quickly i can

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,359
experiment i can

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,720
save publish preview and do that stuff

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,320
uh all over again

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,480
and i'm not blocking like the content

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,359
editors are not blocked marketers can uh

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,079
play with that and also the users are

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,960
the content

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,960
sorry the developers are happy i write

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,480
so and that was it that was the demo

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,640
and now i have like three more slides

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,960
and we are done

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,640
so if you want to finish it and build

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,800
even like better website

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:48,560
like with uh proper navigation menu

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,640
uh featured like headline hero area

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,800
with some footer etc and the multi

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,880

send you all sort of links later

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,800
then of course the good questions are

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,599
like where to start in general with neck

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,920
