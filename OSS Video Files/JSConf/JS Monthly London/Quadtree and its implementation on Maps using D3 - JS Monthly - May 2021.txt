Quadtree and its implementation on Maps using D3
Gunaseelan Narayanan

Have you noticed in a World map, where markers are used to represent something? The markers when seen at the beginning appear close between two locations and when zoomed in, appear far away. If the cities are too close they can even overlap each other. It will look ugly, right? In this talk we will explore the Quadtree approach which can be used to search for geometric points in a plane accurately and instantly and how this can be used in clustering.
