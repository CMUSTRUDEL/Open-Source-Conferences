Data sketches is a collaboration between Nadieh and Shirley, where they choose a topic and visualize it by the end of the month. The collaboration started for many reasons: they weren’t creating as many personal data visualization projects, so they were looking for the motivation to make more. They wanted to explore their creativity, to experiment with the tools that are out there, to learn from each other, and to have fun.

In this talk, Shirley and Nadieh will share the lessons they learned while working on data sketches. They will highlight their favorite months of data, sketches, and code: what made them their favorites, the mistakes made along the way, and how they overcame them. They hope that by sharing their visualizations’ humble, ugly duckling beginnings and their many (embarrassing) iterations, that it will inspire others to create their own unique and compelling visualizations.

[Music]

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,010
hello hi thank you so much for that

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,199
amazing introduction so hey everyone my

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,510
name is Shirley and this is Letty and

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,230
we're to data visualization freelancers

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,210
from Amsterdam in San Francisco and for

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,400
the last 10 months we've been working on

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,099
a project called data sketches where we

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:38,040
take a topic each month and visualize it

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:41,010
by around the end of the month so let's

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,410
start from the very beginning Nani and I

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,680
actually met online in a private data

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,719
visualization slag and the fall of 2015

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,230
and didn't actually meet each other in

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,260
person until open viscom in Boston last

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,050
year where we had the pleasure of giving

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,270
talks separately and hang out for three

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,960
whole days where we got along really

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,900
well so that when two months later Nadi

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,500
put up her as VG tutorials accompanying

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,400
her talks I give them into them with

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,770
vigor and as I started talking to Nadi

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,020
with questions about her tutorials

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,200
restarted somehow commiserating around

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,689
the fact that we really hadn't completed

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,090
as many data visualization side projects

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,470
as we were hoping for in the past year

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,840
and that was when I had an idea and I

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,540
asked Nani fully expecting to be

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,880
rejected do you want to collaborate with

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:45,930
me and then she said yes and that's how

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,000
they discussed started so in the

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,070
following week we fear doubt that we

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,590
both like the idea where we would create

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,500
a visualization around a specific topic

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,630
each month and do that for a year to see

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,880
how two people would create two

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,399
visualizations starting from the same

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,780
seed the topic and then diverging into

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,659
different paths based on our own

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,520
interest in history well besides sharing

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,530
the end result we also want to write

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,030
about the creation process

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,280
and we split this up into the three

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,790
pillars that we find most important data

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,650
sketches and coding and initially we

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,440
thought we could pull data sketches off

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,510
with about five to six hours a week but

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,910
yeah as usual real life doesn't really

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,270
care about your plans especially coding

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,940
plans so since starting in July 2016

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,910
we've clocked many many hours into

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,500
creating a visualization each month and

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,940
during this talk we'd like to take you

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,250
through some of the lessons that we

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,230
learned the challenges that we face now

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,800
we can tackle them and the insights that

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,680
we gathered along the way so let's start

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,290
with the data we often get asked this

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,120
question do you get your idea you get

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,730
your data first and then come up with

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,750
the idea or do you get your ideas first

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:05,310
and for the two of us the answer is

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,530
always always idea first so for example

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,500
for our November data sketches I

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:17,100
visualized every single line in the

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:19,110
musical called Hamilton and built a tool

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,350
where I can filter by any set of

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,780
characters their conversations and

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,790
phrases and then be able to dig into all

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,720
of the lyrics that were left in the

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,390
remaining song and the question I

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,550
started with was this how do the

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,900
relationship change between the

00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:41,670
characters as a musical progresses and

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:45,570
what are the recurring phrases and who

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,760
are they associated with now as you can

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,600
probably imagine this data was not

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,120
available online anywhere so I had to go

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,519
through each of those lyrics noting

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,989
every single time a phrase occurred

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:04,709
across more than one song group those

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,660
phrases into themes and then go through

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,060
the lyrics again entering them into the

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,850
computer and associating them with the

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,440
right song and line number and gene

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,260
exact same thing for the characters and

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,450
conversations and then I wrote a script

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,520
to aggregate those characters in themes

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,030
by their song and line number to get my

00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:27,550
final data set

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:30,670
in a more extreme example I asked

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:35,200
October decided that I wanted to put

00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:40,990
emojis on mr. and mrs. Obama faces so I

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:43,180
have here every YouTube video um that

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,300
you can dig through of their late-night

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,360
talk show appearances and here you can

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:54,100
go home through each of the scenes click

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:58,660
on any of the frames and see their faces

00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,340
on Oh the images are not loading but if

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,960
they load it then you can see the faces

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,100
um oh no oh there we go yeah so emojis

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,060
on their faces

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,220
[Music]

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,780
thank you this skill brings me joy I did

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,560
this for the election because it was

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:20,230
bumming me out

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:22,480
and then this still brings me joy um so

00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,160
the idea really started with when I was

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,970
talking to one of our friends Eric and

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,340
he said wouldn't it be cool if you could

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,950
run facial detection on the videos and

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,350
correlate their emotions with what

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:38,320
they're saying and I was like hey Eric

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,890
you realize I only have one month to do

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,690
this and then I was like you know what

00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:47,350
Eric

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:49,300
challenge accepted so to do this I had

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,260
to manually first gather all of the late

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,880
night talk show appearances also by NVB

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:59,190
get their corresponding YouTube videos

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,690
also their hosts channels use a node

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,850
package to download all the videos and

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,130
their captions so that I can get the

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,010
timestamps from the closed captions to

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:11,740
take a screenshot every time somebody

00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:15,010
talks and then upload them to the Google

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,380
vision API which is a really fun API

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,960
that gives me like the bounds of their

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,000
faces as well as data about like whether

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,210
or not each of these people were like

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,990
happy or angry or sad or was wearing a

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,789
hat and and gave that data back to me in

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,349
a JSON format back then I cleared the

00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:36,960
write a script to aggragate with the

00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:36,960
caption data to get my final data set

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:45,450
[Laughter]

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:48,360
it would be too kind of extreme examples

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:52,050
taught me was that if I have a curiosity

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,970
and curiosity that I can get the data is

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,550
out there somehow whether I have to go

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,590
manually gather them or write a bunch of

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,330
automated scripts which by the way I

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,060
found that there is like a new library

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:06,240
for anything I can imagine Under the Sun

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:09,930
as long as I play responsibly and

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,820
legally so thankfully not every month

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,740
this is data intensive I surely just

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,690
showed us this are more normal months

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,350
and with places you can find data online

00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,880
for example for August I decided to dive

00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,930
into the Olympics well our theme with

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,660
the Olympics because it is rather

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:27,270
obvious and we are both expense and I

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,830
wanted to visualize all 5,000 gold medal

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,710
winners since the very first Olympic

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,870
Games in 1896 so each of these circles

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,600
is a group of similar sports like water

00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,030
sports or ball sports and then each of

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,580
the slices or feathers within a circle

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,290
is one sport Langguth Olympics and then

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,040
we have the first version going out or

00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:48,900
2016 the reddish background are female

00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,110
events the blueish background are male

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,870
events and finally the color of each of

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,910
these medals is the confidence in which

00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,880
the country lies that won the medal so

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:02,100
for example Europe is blue and America's

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,050
is red and so on we can see that at the

00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,150
very first editions there were no female

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,000
ethics events but we've been catching up

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,430
since then thankfully and I found the

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,470
data set for this piece from two

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,620
articles published by the Guardian for

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,880
the 2012 Games in London

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,710
however after getting a rough shape of

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,360
my visual on the screen I noticed some

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,750
very obvious medals from missing from

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,370
2012 like hockey so suddenly my

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,030
confidence in his dataset dropped

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:33,030
drastically and I had to get a sense of

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,740
the actual accuracy of his dataset but I

00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:38,370
didn't want to have to manually go

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,630
through all 5,000 medals myself manually

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,690
although I'm still wondering if surely

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,720
it would not have

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,759
so I found a proxy instead and on

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,259
Wikipedia I could find a number of

00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,389
events that occurred for each of the

00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:52,009
editions and I could compare that to the

00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:53,930
number of gold medals I had in my data

00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,610
set and they proposed the discrepancy I

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,069
dug deeper to figure out where and why

00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,769
and that's how I found out that for some

00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:02,779
of the years the horses were also in the

00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:04,850
dataset winning gold which makes for an

00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:06,920
interesting read assembly see princess

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,069
and and lady Mirka as women

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,259
winning gold in the Olympics well

00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:14,600
finally I figured out each discrepancy

00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:16,189
and made adjustments to my data to get

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,920
it to the point where I trusted it again

00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,329
and my lesson here was that even coming

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,430
from such a respectable source as the

00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:24,199
Guardian I really need to get a sense of

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,240
accuracy and completeness of my data

00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:28,399
because missing data can be harder to

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,470
find them wrong data you don't always

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,300
have to check every value but think

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,490
about taking sums and counts and

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,800
averages and comparing these two plain

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:41,360
common sense or even better at different

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,610
data source so many people jump straight

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,680
from data as a final visual but take

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,410
some time and sit back and sketch out

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,089
your ideas instead we filled many pages

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,130
of our notebooks in starting because

00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:55,189
sketching helps us think and layout

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,829
ideas beforehand and my sketches are

00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:59,930
often very simple and I really only

00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:02,300
focus on the main abstract shapes then I

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,029
want to fit my data into like colors and

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,100
layout and details these are things I

00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:09,470
only vaguely think about but don't act

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,779
on until I have the data on my screen

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,610
there's just no use to think about these

00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,199
things until I figured out that the data

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,509
works once I've morphed it into the

00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:19,009
final shape and for the Olympics for

00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:21,230
example I had this idea of feathers

00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:23,959
placing more emphasis on the recent

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,730
additions however I had no idea that

00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,680
would look a white when I finally placed

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,809
all 5,000 medals together

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,870
I have to see the general shape woodwork

00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:35,029
before moving on so I started laying out

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,009
the feathers and it took a few steps but

00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:39,139
if I eventually I came to the point

00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:41,839
where I saw that luckily it did show

00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:44,180
potential with the actual data but

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,680
sometimes there is no use of start

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,800
sketching on paper although I will say

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,440
that forever but networks an exception

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,990
for me and for October my

00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,879
thing to dive into was royalty versus

00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,769
the Obamas and I've always been

00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,389
intrigued by how into marriage the

00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:03,240
Royals really are you know are they old

00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:05,519
cousins twice removed and luckily I

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,949
found a genealogy data set that

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,310
contained a gigantic family tree as a

00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:13,290
European royal houses it was from 1992

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,819
so I have to add one or two more

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,649
generations in the main line of

00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:21,180
succession which was a fun night on

00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:24,449
Wikipedia but so here we have the family

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,250
three or 3,000 people and the current

00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:28,439
royal leaders are the big circles and

00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,629
everybody is connected to their parents

00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:32,009
their partner and their children and to

00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:34,560
highlight the interconnections you can

00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:36,060
actually hover over anybody and see how

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,209
far their six degrees of separation

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,300
would lead into the web and you can also

00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:45,480
click on anybody see if that works here

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,279
and anybody else to see the shortest

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,120
path between these two people because

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,649
the entire web is connected well but

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,600
when I started out with this data set I

00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:56,670
had no idea what it contained

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,620
so I just put everybody on the page

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,980
using the most basic network settings

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,350
and this happened an explosion of points

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,199
on lines going out of my screen well

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:10,230
let's reign in gravity bit then but that

00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:12,380
left me with a useless hairball well

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:16,019
maybe I could color them by year first

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,970
no not helping but luckily in decreased

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,610
version while the newest version you can

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,920
have gravity depend on variables so I

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,649
pulled the web apart by year of birth as

00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,319
well that was better but it was still a

00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:30,509
rather unentitled bundle and at this

00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:32,339
point I'd already invested several hours

00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:33,600
into playing with the network settings

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,120
playing with the different kinds of

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,579
connection adjusting my data and I was

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,709
really ready to just give up but you

00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,870
know I gave it one last time and this

00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:45,089
time I decided to focus on the current

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,069
Royal leaders so I please these in a

00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:49,379
line and then I let the vertebral

00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:51,029
gravity depend on how you know which of

00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,579
these recurrent royal leaders you were

00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:56,639
most closely related to and that's when

00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:58,170
I finally saw it insight for example

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,480
that the Queen of Denmark over here is

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,069
actually very central to the web whereas

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,630
the princes monocle line here is

00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:04,180
separated from the rest more than two

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,120
hundred year

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,770
ago and it was only around this time

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,010
that I finally started thinking about

00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,910
the more of the design aspects and

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,980
networks often reminds me of

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,110
constellations and with my astronomy

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,640
background I have a bias rolling space

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:23,140
so I turned it into a starry night and

00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,690
the thing is I could have never designed

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,180
this visualization beforehand I had to

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,520
go hand in hand the actual data and

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,890
apply my design choices to all of the

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,370
data simultaneously to see if the

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,810
results are both engaging and insightful

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:41,020
so now you gave us a really great

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:43,089
example of when we land on the right

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,240
visualization form early on in our

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:48,490
process but that's not always the case

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,290
so for our March data schedules we had

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,850
the incredible opportunity to work with

00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,270
the Google News lab and their search

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:57,730
data dating back to 2004 and with access

00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,649
to this incredible amount of data I

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,980
wanted to take a look at what countries

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:08,950
searched for around the world for travel

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:12,010
across each different seasons and for a

00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:14,709
particular country I wanted to be able

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,420
to see for each of those topics what are

00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:20,110
the search interests across the years

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:23,350
and their seasonality patterns but to

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,240
get to this point I first asked what are

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,790
the top search countries and it turns

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,690
out it's Brazil and then I wondered

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:33,279
who's searching for Brazil what are the

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,770
kind of topics are is being searched for

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,980
for Brazil and each of those countries

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:42,400
and what are the distributions like

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,620
across each of the years and then I

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,110
wondered can I put search interests in

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,520
there somehow

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:52,570
which did not turn out so well I call

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:55,150
this my plunder theory so I took a step

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,720
back and I say ok so maybe I can try out

00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,850
circles as each of those topics and show

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,220
the search interest as a radius of each

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,060
circle and for each country searching

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,070
for that topic

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,930
I'll have overlapping circles and this

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,040
is what it looked like and I thought it

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,860
looked pretty ok

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,470
it's kind of pretty so then I wondered

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,270
well I think I noticed that maybe

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,480
geography plays a part in who's

00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:20,089
searching for a country

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,790
topics within the country so maybe I can

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:25,639
try sorting those topics for particular

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,980
year by distance and that didn't look so

00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,109
great so then I was like maybe I can

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,299
just concentrate on one topic across the

00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:36,769
years and that looks like maybe it will

00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:38,209
lend nicely to a heat map like ha this

00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,209
is not going anywhere

00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:43,759
and then but then I remembered that

00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:45,109
earlier on in my explorations I had

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,809
noticed that there's a lot of

00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:50,329
seasonality in a lot of the topics so

00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:52,549
then I wondered can i filter and group

00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:55,009
each of those topics by each of the

00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:56,749
seasons and maybe the sounded kind of

00:15:55,009 --> 00:16:00,529
promising like maybe I'll be able to get

00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:03,019
some insights out of this and nope it

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:04,939
turns out that each of those topics are

00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:06,949
searched for across all of the seasons

00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:10,069
which meant that each of the graphs

00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:12,559
actually looked exactly the same I was

00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:15,169
really disappointed but then but then I

00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,819
remembered by hey the search interests

00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:18,859
are different across each of the seasons

00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:20,989
which means that if I decides the height

00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:22,759
of each of those blogs by the search

00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:24,889
interest then I can start getting

00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,230
insights like this one but the United

00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:31,489
States searches for travel more often in

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:34,819
the spring than in the fall so finally

00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:37,519
finally Tuggle the final visualization

00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:40,609
where each of the blog's that represent

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,529
a topic group by their country and I can

00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:45,679
toggle between the seasons and see

00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:48,079
insights like for example that Mexico

00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,239
search interests is low in the summer

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,769
but the Canada is high and the same is

00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:53,539
true for the hotter countries around the

00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:56,989
world like the Thailand and the

00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:59,329
Philippines but when I toggle to winter

00:16:56,989 --> 00:17:01,879
the opposite is true and I can see that

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:04,130
Mexico Peaks where Canada drops and

00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:11,959
Thailand and the Philippines have peaked

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:14,779
also so the lesson I learned is that

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,000
sometimes we don't get the right

00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:20,689
visualization for the data on our first

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,029
or a second or even third sketch so be

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:25,819
patient and go back and forth with the

00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:28,010
sketching code to figure out what works

00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:31,070
and more importantly what doesn't work

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:34,380
so we can figure out where to go next

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,149
so as expected most of our hours are

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,000
spent on actually getting the data on

00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:42,149
the screen and here are some of our may

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,830
be less obvious coding lessons for our

00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:45,990
very first month the topic was moving

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,370
and for me it was immediately clear I

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,980
wanted to do something with the Lord of

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,139
the Rings and I found this amazing data

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,200
set that contained the number of words

00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:57,630
spoken by each character in each scene

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,510
of all three extended editions of the

00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:02,880
lore the Rings and how amazing is that I

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,340
knew I had to visualize that and I

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,139
decided to focus on the troubleshoot

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,639
member so how much have each member of

00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:11,970
the Fellowship spoken at the different

00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:14,070
locations that we have on site here well

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,789
no surprise maybe if Gandalf says the

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:19,950
most but my favorite insight was that

00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:22,019
Boromir who is really only alive during

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,909
one movie manages to speak more than

00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:29,909
Legolas does in three I didn't know that

00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:32,010
anyways here is a sketch of my project

00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:34,380
and when I saw it I found that it was

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,570
very similar looking to a chord diagram

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,610
so I decided to start from there and

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,429
then slowly transform the chord diagram

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,220
into my sketch and here we have a

00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:45,870
typical chord diagram and the most

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,370
fundamental thing to me was is if I

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,620
could figure out how to get each inner

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,929
inner chords to flow towards the center

00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,179
which actually took less time than

00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:57,120
anticipated which is very rare for me in

00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,950
coding but getting rid of the space and

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,110
now it was ready to handle the actual

00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:04,080
Lord of the Rings data in some more

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,580
appropriate colors well we asked nine

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,320
members of the fellowship so I have to

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,059
make sure the center's end up at the

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,330
right vertical location but now is

00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:15,480
getting very squished so I just pulled

00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:17,340
the two halves apart but these chords

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,710
they are looking kind of unnatural right

00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,289
now and that's when I decided to finally

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,490
dive into SVG paths and learn how to

00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:27,269
make them myself

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:29,279
it took a while but it was really an

00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:31,889
improvement on these chords how they

00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,690
looked finally and that's how I sort of

00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:36,529
ended up with this new kind of chart

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:39,029
that mutated from the chord diagram and

00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:41,340
many people have done the wonderful work

00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:43,289
that you can use so even if you are

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,130
creating something new you don't always

00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:46,470
have to start

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,750
scratch just pick the thing the life

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,059
most closely to your design or idea and

00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,429
start adjusting that you know remix was

00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:55,950
out there already but sometimes

00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:58,080
sometimes we managed to dream up things

00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,780
are unique enough where there is no base

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,630
for us to remix office for that same

00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:06,360
month of movies I wanted to look at the

00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:10,289
top summer blockbusters of the past two

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,030
decades and reimagine them as flowers so

00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:14,039
each of the colors represent a different

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,840
genre and the number and the size and

00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:19,080
the number of petals of the flowers

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,049
correspond to the I am there at IMDb

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,700
rateing and so we have some really

00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:26,909
beautiful ones in here like The Dark

00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,909
Knight Rises and inception and Slumdog

00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:34,039
Millionaire but my absolute absolute

00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:37,530
favorite is the 1997 Batman and Robin

00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:42,030
because it's so teeny-tiny so cute

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:45,179
I think it's so cute and I gotten that

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,700
uh and we've gotten really great

00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,470
responses for this and people have asked

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,409
me how did you make this visualization

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,880
how long did it take you and the answer

00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:55,679
is actually that it's actually really

00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,020
simple and straightforward and all it

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,740
takes is a good grasp of the SVG path

00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:06,150
and in particular the cubic Bezier curve

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:08,580
command and so how that works is we

00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:10,440
start with a point in this case 0 0 and

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,539
the way that I like to think about it is

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,440
that we draw a line from that starting

00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:18,419
point to the ending purple point and

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,760
then we take the blue and green anchor

00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:24,600
points and nudge them out until we get

00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,870
the curve that we want we draw a line to

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,950
line or I draw two lines and then make

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:35,250
the same a curve on the other side

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:42,900
rotate the petals out and then add in

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:44,820
the colors and those it and so really

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,520
understand the tools that you're using

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,010
because with that understanding we can

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,780
really go beyond the prescribed examples

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:55,320
of pre-existing examples that are out

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,870
there ready and then the particular

00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,370
of all of the tools that we use as a

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,910
sheep as is probably our favorite

00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:06,210
because with a good grasp of SVG path we

00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:08,450
can make any shape that we dream up for

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,640
truly truly unique results

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,740
so besides SVG paths we've also had a

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,410
lot of fun playing with math in the past

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,060
few months and as my addition to the

00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:21,120
collaboration month with Google News lab

00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:23,400
I decided to dive into translations so

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,130
what have other languages translated to

00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,950
English we're going from the most

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:32,100
translated words for 10 chosen languages

00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:35,430
like German and Dutch and more to the

00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,880
top 10 most translated words down to the

00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:41,130
similarities between languages and here

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,230
each of the lines between two languages

00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,790
represents one word that these two

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,300
languages have in common between their

00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:50,100
top 10 at first I wanted to replace all

00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,010
of these lines with the actual words

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,080
that they represent well yeah then I

00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,600
actually saw it and a complete mess it's

00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,120
way too busy so it took a few iterations

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,220
to finally get to this more focused and

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,230
clear version but one of the most

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,290
important things here was that these

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:10,710
words over here we're all as upright as

00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:13,080
possible for readability but that turned

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,360
into some convoluted calculations for

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,820
you to get these text paths which became

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,260
glaringly obvious once I click one of

00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,260
these circles which moves it to the

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:25,830
center yeah that wasn't quite how you

00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:28,590
might have expected it to go so I needed

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,480
to figure out how to fix that and that's

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,560
where math and rational problem solving

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,720
came to the rescue

00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,120
yeah it took a few pages out of my

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,620
notebook but eventually I figured out

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,690
how to implement the solution so now if

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,020
I click any of these languages it is

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,550
more like somebody would expect it to go

00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,280
but I what I've done is really more of a

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,890
hack maybe because once you click one of

00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,380
these circles the words they are faded

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,940
out and then I immediately replace all

00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,250
of these lines with their final states

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,870
but I prefer engineered them to their

00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:05,370
previous state and then smoothly

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:07,320
transition them to the final state so my

00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,860
lesson here was I guess I knew it

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,170
already but if you are

00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,640
doing something new definitely expect

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:15,760
that it will take time because you are

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,740
going to encounter struggles and if you

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,110
didn't already learn to love math

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,730
because it is usually your best friend

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:26,470
in solving these kinds of visual

00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:28,720
problems so thus far we've talked about

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:31,120
the what I like to call the first 80%

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,040
the data preparation the ideation the

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,830
sketching and the visualization is self

00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,710
but there's the rest of the 20% but

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,950
details that we find really important

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,590
also so when I started thinking about

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:46,630
the story for Hamilton I knew that I

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,880
wanted it to reach a wider audience than

00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,650
usual and I knew I wanted them to be

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,990
engaged enough to keep scrolling down

00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:56,020
the screen so the very first thing I did

00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:58,330
was on page load there is all of the

00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:01,210
dots fly into the center to create the

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:04,830
Hamilton logo and as the users start

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:09,429
scrolling down the screen the dots

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:11,799
fly apart and then dance around until

00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:13,929
they get pulled back in together so that

00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:17,830
I can show the reader that he each of

00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:20,799
these dots are actually Fowler and as

00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:23,980
the reader Scrolls into the first

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:26,500
section of analysis each of these

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,900
sections are actually corresponding with

00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,380
one of the songs so then I highlight the

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:34,690
write corresponding song for them the

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,240
other thing that I did is that if the

00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:43,870
user decides they want to click on one

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:47,260
of the songs oh there's no way reduce

00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:48,669
no audio okay well believe me when I say

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,850
that there's a song playing somewhere in

00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:55,059
there and so as you can see there's a

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:57,400
progress bar that I highlight I'm in the

00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:59,590
visualization in the right so that the

00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,570
user can get a sense of where the song

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:07,780
is that's playing that relative to the

00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:09,669
rest of the musical another example a

00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,980
smaller example that I want to show you

00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:17,080
is that for that same month of travel I

00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,700
have these sections where I animate how

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,860
to read different sections of the

00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,950
visualizations

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:26,140
but I don't start the animations until

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,200
the user Scrolls down into the correct

00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,600
section so that no matter how quickly or

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,580
slowly they scroll they can always see

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,840
the animation from start to beginning

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:39,730
and it's really these small attention to

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,190
detail and the temps that delight that

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,440
really make a piece for me because it

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:47,740
tells the reader that we really care

00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,179
about their experience and even more

00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,149
examples of things you could do with the

00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:55,260
light well all slides back to answer

00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:59,380
them actually from CSS combs in

00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:05,110
Melbourne I decided to make I hope if it

00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:06,899
ever gets to the next page I have to

00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:10,659
[Music]

00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:12,279
there we go yeah right so I didn't have

00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:14,260
any Wi-Fi and you know what ten thousand

00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,690
feet so I couldn't do anything essential

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,970
and I decided to just create an animated

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:22,389
legend of my visualisation about fantasy

00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:24,820
books you know for fun and or adding

00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:28,210
animated gifs of the most memorable and

00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,769
fun moments in Dragonball Z or having a

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,779
hopper with the most detailed

00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:34,330
information I had for music nerves in my

00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:37,240
December music visual or turning the top

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:40,149
ten songs into tiny vinyls having

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,130
annotations about sphere appeared weird

00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:44,620
and silly events of the Olympic Games

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,480
like Henry piers having to stop for

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:50,110
ducks in the rowing event but still

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,940
managing to win gold you know although

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:53,889
getting your data on the screen in such

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,200
a manner as to make it insightful is key

00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:58,720
it's the extra things to add like

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,730
animations annotations we're at Legends

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,130
gifts and more that will make it unique

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:05,679
and special and even more of a delight

00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,710
to investigate so take some time to

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,409
think about these aspects as well so

00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:13,929
finally finally we get to the salsa or

00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:16,179
what I like to call the best stuff so

00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:18,460
when Maddie and I started talking about

00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:20,860
this project but we really weren't

00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,419
expecting the kind of response we got we

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,190
thought that if we could just have fun

00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:26,230
and maybe you learn some things and if

00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:28,059
our friends enjoyed it then that'd be

00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,620
enough and that'd be really cool but

00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:32,289
instead we've gotten them the most

00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,770
amazing feedback both about our

00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:36,110
visualizations and the

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:38,080
value of our write-up and we've had the

00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:40,630
opportunity to meet some amazing

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,730
credible people and talk to them and

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:47,900
even gain an unexpectedly great

00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:49,610
friendship out of all of this but when

00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,040
we really sat back to think about the

00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,440
transferable lessons the most important

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:57,140
thing that we agreed on is that if

00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,650
you're about to embark on an ambitious

00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:03,530
project grab someone to go along the

00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:05,510
ride with you because then you can

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:08,480
motivate and support each other when

00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:11,180
things get tough and make sure that that

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,950
someone you grab is if you're not so

00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,320
responsible yourself but it's someone

00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,510
very responsible so that you can keep

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,630
each other accountable and relatively on

00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:24,020
track and because you don't want to eat

00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:26,600
let each other down make sure that

00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,910
someone you grab is someone you really

00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,000
respect and hopefully the few who use

00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:33,770
mutual you respect each other and but

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,920
most importantly that someone is someone

00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:39,680
you trust or can grow to trust because

00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:44,630
that's absolutely essential to giving

00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:46,700
and receiving feedback and finally can

00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,160
we talk about to do something ambitious

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,340
like make a data visualization from

00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:55,430
scratch every single month and know that

00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,290
it's going to be hard and we've been

00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,700
creatively drained we see there was a

00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,470
month where we've been creatively

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,610
drained and we didn't know how to go on

00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:06,110
just remember you learn as you struggle

00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,790
and the amount that we've learned both

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:09,890
personally and technically have been

00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:12,650
absolutely amazing and very much worth

00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:14,690
the time so over the last 10 months

00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,300
we've learned to find data and the

00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,860
weirdest of places that you can sketch

00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,410
the weed out thinking errors but that

00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:24,320
you can also sketch with code that SVG

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:25,160
paths and math are amazing but we really

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,560
knew that of course

00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,420
and that surprisingly small things can

00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,270
Edinson to delight to your audience and

00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,070
we did set out to learn or we can funded

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,870
by all these things like Shirley said we

00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,300
set out to have fun and then that would

00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,100
definitely succeed it sure it's been

00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,570
tough there were times when we were

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,760
coding into the night when we would have

00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,620
rather bench the TV show but it had

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,340
opened up new paths and opportunities

00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,380
that we were

00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,750
you're looking for so we hope that

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,150
you'll join us in our final two months

00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,850
of data munging sketching and coding up

00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:58,250
our topics into fun weird and overtly

00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:06,110
elaborate visualizations thank you very

00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:07,610
much very magic oh how is that Donna

00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:11,119
sketched yes

00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,119
