Title: CSSconf EU 2017 | Sareh Heidari: Scaffolding CSS for Scale
Publication date: 2017-05-24

	http://2017.cssconf.eu/speakers/sareh-heidari.html

Ever thought about localising your site, but realised it led to a lot of messy duplication? Do you want to re-use component styles, but have some styles overwrite others due to that cascade? Not sure where to start with CSS architecture?

In this talk, you'll learn how to get started with your own lightweight, localised CSS setup. We'll go through how we use Grandstand, a CSS framework built by BBC Sport, as the scaffolding for our CSS. Starting with bare bones of just ~10kb, it has the flexibility to allow layouts in 10 scripts for 20+ languages, and weâ€™re using it across the BBC News & Sport sites.

00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,750
hello thanks for the warm welcome it's

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,970
great to be here my first time visiting

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,699
Berlin as well so what a brilliant

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,699
occasion to be here and thank you

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,800
just one moment we will try this again

00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,850
rias great so hi I am Sarah hey Gary I

00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,920
am a web developer I work at the BBC

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,290
news it's been about a year and a half

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
I've been working there and it's my

00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,930
first web development role so it's been

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,600
pretty fun pretty fun real severe so

00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,910
i've the project that I've been working

00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,160
on for the duration of the my time there

00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:13,300
has been the redesign rebuild of the

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:15,520
news front page so as pretty cool so and

00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,710
what's been part of this is that there's

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,390
the whole set of the backend so it's a

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,580
reaction server side but also the

00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:25,479
front-end so a whole new CSS framework

00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,070
and setting up walls from scratch so I'm

00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,160
going to start with a little bit of a

00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,320
question first off how many of you have

00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,250
ever visited the BBC News website hands

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,280
up cool so that's pretty much one with

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:42,060
Trivedi and okay so and half again if

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,310
you've used it in like say the last week

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,119
okay cool see you also still good number

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,399
cool

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,149
so just to give a bit of context is like

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,910
you're not alone there are 650 676

00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:57,009
million weekly visitors to the site and

00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,539
actually what surprised me when I first

00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,580
found out it's actually about around

00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:03,369
two-thirds of them from outside of the

00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,840
UK so that song found that pretty

00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:08,289
surprising last time when I was looking

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,990
at with that so another question how

00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:12,790
many of you have ever visited one of

00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:18,340
these web service sites

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:21,550
hands up okay I think one or two great

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,700
cool some more single people maybe great

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:29,319
so these these sites these are all

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:33,490
separate and new sites are around 29 of

00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:36,370
them and 29 different sites they have

00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:39,340
different languages different kind of

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,560
news agendas and news stories being

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,090
shared on them and what's pretty cool

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,180
about them is that they're actually all

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:50,410
have a based on the same code base as

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,300
like the English recited so for example

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,400
under abuse among those the Spanish

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:58,629
language site and that's got around 16

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:03,260
million monthly visitors site

00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:05,420
so yeah so as a half around almost 60

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,969
million monthly visitors to all of those

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,250
sexes with nine different languages odd

00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:13,189
service sites and what's pretty cool is

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,689
that almost all of 99% of users are

00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:17,980
actually from outside the UK so

00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:20,150
interesting challenges there and and

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,349
what's pretty cool is that we're going

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:28,549
to launch a few more sites are very soon

00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:30,680
and we're in South of Asia and look

00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:34,819
through Africa as well so areas which we

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,590
had little connections bandwidth perhaps

00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:38,299
memory some slower connections and

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,650
things like that so really really

00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:44,480
interesting challenges in terms of

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:46,310
scaling to different regions and then

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,409
generally if you not just BBC news and

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,019
what service there's like other services

00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:52,579
so that do you see kind of losses or a

00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:54,709
night air and things and then there's

00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:56,599
this kind of really high target to kind

00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,329
of get some chance empty million like

00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:02,510
users worldwide so like within a little

00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:04,340
about five years or so so yeah so huge

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,290
numbers kind of difficult to kind of put

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,409
them into context so that's going to be

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,629
enough of this just the big statistics

00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:13,549
really and I'm just going to like just

00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:15,650
all that down to like what what that

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:17,840
intro review about so lots of users lots

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,880
of pages what we really care about is

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,500
like reusing things so as you can

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,949
imagine like having lots of their sites

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,020
it's like it doesn't make sense to

00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:28,490
rebuild everything for for all of those

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,539
things it will be like a maintenance

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,930
nightmare

00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:36,289
so as much of a reusability that we can

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:39,349
get in our systems are better and want

00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:42,830
our sites be localizable which is so to

00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:44,539
be able to just change the script some

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,870
languages and things and to make them

00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:49,520
lightweight so especially for some of

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,430
the different regions that we're going

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,070
into where they're outside of Europe and

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,349
outs of the US and things that are slow

00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,210
connections that we can can ensure that

00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:03,380
our pages are able to get to them as

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:05,120
fast as possible so and so these things

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,740
you might say thinking alright I'm not

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,599
actually working on a big site I'm

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,040
actually working on a breeze like like I

00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,920
don't have like 60 million

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,710
what is this like relevant to you how is

00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,780
this talk actually gonna be relevant and

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,610
what I think more like the last three

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,680
are actually relevant to like no matter

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,260
what kind of site you're you're so well

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,760
could be thinking about kind of and in

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,980
terms of our little lightweight

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,690
lightweight like who doesn't want a site

00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,590
that low class that's pretty liberal

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,300
user experience really feasible to our

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,370
player cave in this life that if you're

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,720
thinking you know the next billion users

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,040
are probably going to be in different

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,080
reasons why why wouldn't you want to

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,970
tabs be able to write some content

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,630
outside from your services to like

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,220
different in different languages

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,870
Andrey's ability like we want to make

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,640
our life easy right we don't want to

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,160
keep like building the same things over

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,100
and over again and if we can reuse

00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,160
things that's just next mixing Center so

00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,170
yes I think this although like the main

00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,820
case I'm going to be talking about my

00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,950
examples I'm going to be talking about

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,270
over out the BBC news site I think that

00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,710
lot are there will be things that you

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,060
can take away to like whatever kind of

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,950
size of projects that you're working on

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,790
you know if there's like a Hobby weekend

00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:18,350
thing as well right so that's a bit of

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,210
the introduction and this is kind of how

00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,240
I'm going to talk through the rest of

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,970
this so I'm going to like introduce

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,090
brand sound so BBC Grand Stand is the

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:33,800
CSM framework that we've using and it

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:36,800
was actually built by BBC Sports so

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,890
separate team and the main creator Sean

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,810
bent he was he he thought that as well

00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,750
and used for like live pages and things

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,180
which are kind of like line updates to

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,310
like sports events so you can get up to

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,140
the minute as assortments and then that

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,000
was like kids use the news and things

00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,700
like that so we're like okay you use

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,220
really well we should like think about

00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,560
reusing this for for our new sites in

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,040
general so that's the kind of background

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,370
so well I'll talk a bit about the ins

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,370
and outs of grandstand and then how it

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,500
has helped us to to ensure it to be like

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,220
a CSS for our site to be like

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,990
lightweight localizable reusable and

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,260
touching on at the end about how would

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,020
you actually go about building your own

00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:25,870
yeah so how did you where would you get

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,460
started like can you just pick up grass

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,100
and use it or do would you actually need

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,250
to start from scratch so what kind of

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:38,110
all the topics we'll talk about soon so

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:40,660
grandstand yep so this is a kind of an

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,310
intimidating list okay you don't need to

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,540
know all of these things we kind of

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,580
going through them a little bit of time

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,590
I found it pretty difficult when

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:52,510
starting out understand like these

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:54,040
abstract concepts and things so instead

00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,900
of just kind of going through the

00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,130
one-by-one and just talking about the

00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,400
theory behind it all

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,500
I thought I'd start off with examples

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,200
because I find it much easier to

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,540
understand things for examples alright

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,060
so as you surfaces like the front pages

00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,040
we've seen years on some desk looks like

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,260
a bit more of an industry breeze that

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,030
will be a lot of people do that set

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,330
films

00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:21,550
remember so let's actually look at three

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,220
different parts of the of the page

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:27,610
layout and this will three things up

00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:30,250
close so the first one is like a live

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,400
poll so actually on that website it does

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,589
also it's got CSS animations the second

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,229
one is the timestamp soul or clock icon

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:41,760
with like how long text saying how long

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:45,120
ago the story replaced last updated and

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:50,440
finally like a media icon like media

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,760
play video icon with the heading so okay

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,530
you might look at these and think all

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,360
right so these are actually very

00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,430
different like the different colors this

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,010
like a different like and typography

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,680
that the sponsor like the different

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,839
iPhones do like there's nothing really

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,490
similar with this but actually if you

00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,810
look kind of a bit closer you can

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,430
actually see that under the hood

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:17,260
counseling and there are similarities

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:21,940
here so for example you'll see that

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:23,740
there is the text and to the left of

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,580
that there is an icon which is exactly

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,190
the same height as the text

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,290
in which some of that and it fit the

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,930
spacing between them right so that's a

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,830
very similar hand so that's like

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,899
different components because ever

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,490
they're not nests they're not identical

00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:41,300
you know different styling some things

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:44,209
but other hoods those have a similar

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,310
base pattern so we can actually use that

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,620
we can actually extract that out it's

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,690
like a bullet patterns school a bullet

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,399
pattern because like Phillip points

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,290
something so it kind of reminds you of

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,050
like kinda web came up some bullet

00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:59,779
points and all that kind of thing so

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,940
yeah so what was this pattern a block of

00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,670
text icon with the same height of it and

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,160
space et and I'm so pretty pretty simple

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:11,660
but it's been used in multiple places so

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,920
actually this is this is the kind of

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,149
emblem atmosphere this is actually a

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:20,720
memetic of like what this grandstand

00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:25,100
framework allows us to do so we separate

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,070
out lookup of the abstract so what we

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,269
want is to make sure that component so

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,390
those three different components that

00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:34,190
look pretty different they you don't

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,160
actually repeat that CSS from the

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:40,520
structure all of the time so we pull out

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,200
the common part right so that's that's

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,480
the whole list of all everything can

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,070
grandstand and actually the bullet

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,550
pattern that we just looked at is an

00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:52,430
object it's it's it's basically it falls

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,140
under objects and actually there are 11

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,089
different objects in I had in the

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,529
network instead of going through all of

00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:00,709
them are just like refer you to the

00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:02,660
doctor because but I think swivel it

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,250
happened kind of this is just the Matic

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,930
sort of one that's a flag so you can

00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,670
have an image that makes the text align

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,079
of the middle because we know we don't

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,390
want to all center-aligned things

00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,709
basically all the time I hand we'd like

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:17,500
to just have something quickly to see

00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:20,420
you and breathe so there's the objects

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,399
before we go onto the next subject I

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,760
want to just have a look quick aside

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,459
that in grants and we want to namespace

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,399
all the things so what does that mean so

00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,019
you want to namespace all of our classes

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,430
you know we don't want to have a class

00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,690
name that actually conflicts with

00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,040
another class that's something that

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,259
somebody else for a double go because

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,199
see yet so you know every

00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,029
class name in existence as enough edges

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,009
maybe maybe you do that's brilliant

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:47,769
but I don't know working the blue team

00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:49,749
maybe I like say that I don't know

00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:52,749
exactly every class meeting but every

00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:56,619
other cumber member to member his room

00:11:52,749 --> 00:12:01,029
so so this is actually name spacing

00:11:56,619 --> 00:12:03,160
really helps so GF gfs so this is the

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,350
kind of start of what we have the start

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,189
of our class name I've ever think in the

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,959
free book so first an and because we are

00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:13,949
dealing with like the absolutes a

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,169
pattern which is an object and we

00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:18,879
actually do fix it with GFO so when you

00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,709
look at the class in your email into

00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,479
your inspector or something like that

00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:25,629
you can you know exactly what it is it's

00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:28,209
like a person object happens and we

00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:30,009
actually use them so so there's a gso

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,259
bullets and Lizzie assumes let's

00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:35,439
understand of the icon and there's also

00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:39,089
GSA's billet underscore text and all

00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:41,979
that so that's how it kind of builds up

00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:44,169
so okay those are our objects

00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:48,249
what else does grandstand have really

00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:52,359
what else can you use so there's a whole

00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:54,309
other set of paths called utilities as

00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:58,449
you might expect the chaotically you so

00:12:54,309 --> 00:13:02,220
it's the GS you starts off with all the

00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:04,629
classes start with the GS s you so

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,959
what's included so this link reads

00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:10,929
everything like margins padding slopes

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,359
display all of that why do we need to do

00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:15,939
that why can't we just just write by the

00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:17,199
name enlarge and write 15 pixels from

00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:21,489
all of that it's really straightforward

00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:24,429
right well what we want is we want to

00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:27,249
standardizing so for example margin

00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:30,089
right we've got GS um are large and

00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:34,869
right is short we want short class name

00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:38,199
cz and so when you add that GS um are to

00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:41,109
that like live the live pulse section

00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:42,789
and you get that full orange gap so that

00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:44,259
there aren't margin that the pair so

00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,879
it's pretty straightforward it just adds

00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:49,070
it to the you don't need to kind of

00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:54,210
write custom CSS for this particular

00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:56,460
component to do that you and likewise I

00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,770
mean it doesn't necessarily look look

00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,510
the best idea to design here because I

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:04,230
just wanted to show the same example but

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:07,400
if you change the GS um are two GS u ml

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:11,850
so margin left then it all put the same

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:14,450
margin on the other side so that's how

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:17,070
you can kind of look at them service

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:20,070
that's just margin but they're the same

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,630
kind of setup for padding like padding

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,300
top and bottom and all that as well and

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,850
display display block and display:none

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,250
and relays as well so all of the things

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:33,990
that you kind of need to to get get

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:38,810
running early so okay so there's the

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:42,000
utility now what assessable so we

00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:44,430
grandstand isn't just and like compiled

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,330
CSS is actually fast that we for

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:50,010
pentathol down

00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:51,900
and so what SAS tools well they have a

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:55,320
lot like color variables and things so

00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:58,260
we have like Evan which is like columns

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,330
dark very dark gray and you'll have mix

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,740
ins which I will talk about later and

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,600
how they are relevant and how they're

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:09,090
useful particularly related to

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:14,550
localizing localizing our grids and

00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:16,110
things so so ok the staff tools and then

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,800
there are like three other sections of

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,570
the parts of grandstand and I actually I

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,070
don't like technically like passive

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,120
grandson activity grand centers though

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:29,010
it built up but it's you can see the

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,410
select gel typography gel grid and gel

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,940
iconography so these are this like cool

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,720
the beauty like global experience

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,820
language and this is decided across the

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,220
whole organization safe knees for

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,710
iPlayer music all of the different kind

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,200
of big products of the BBC have decided

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,600
on like like a share typography a chef

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,490
grid system all of this so that there's

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,900
continuity between the site and so that

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:58,790
there is continuing with us throughout

00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,890
the kind of BBC exterior

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:05,210
so that's what that means global

00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:10,040
experience language so I'm a typography

00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:12,350
so we've got a census so the the UX

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,480
themes have got together and created

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,750
results out of typography what's pretty

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,070
cool about it is if you clicked into the

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:23,480
sunlight design systems and things it

00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,770
decides is actually the pixel sizes and

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,230
the line height change at different

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:29,180
break points so to enable you if you're

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,540
on the mobile to have a large enough

00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,500
larger kind of size so it's clear

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,600
whereas if you're definitely probably

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,230
want it smaller so that so that's it

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:43,360
so so there's a lot a lot of works on

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:47,960
behind the scenes to to set us up

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,730
there's a job for it so if you use

00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,690
different different observers just like

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:56,210
a percentage brave spirit which so but

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,720
you've got one column if extent two

00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:02,000
columns etc and we've got like set

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,880
gutters between them to make sure at all

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,770
of our libraries looks like unique

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,290
toothpaste and gel iconography so SVG

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:15,110
icons that shared across the board this

00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,940
is just a one very small selection there

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:19,640
are all sorts of different ones and like

00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:22,810
every sport imaginable has an icon that

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,250
we use for uses in news we're pretty

00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,990
we're basically in use of some of these

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:33,230
for like videos audios images things

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:35,960
like that so okay so that was a bit of a

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,530
whistle-stop tour of different parts of

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,530
Grand Stand

00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,920
actually you might notice things just

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,060
rearranged a bit I talked to little

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,250
through them and like that particular

00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:49,100
order because I thought that made more

00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:51,050
sense in my head anyway and but actually

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,480
what Grand Stand the structure and

00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:56,030
grandstand is that you pull in all the

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,650
gel like Google and gel foundation so

00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,740
the grid photography item in the first

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,900
and then you have your like your like

00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,810
product specific things so the objects

00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,220
in utilities afters and tassels that's

00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:11,300
the kind of

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:16,130
hierarchy of items and there is a much

00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:18,820
much more detailed like write-up of why

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:22,010
this is kind of like inverted triangle

00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:24,080
CSS and how roberts has given numerous

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,570
talks on that so do recommender I'll

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,890
sort of share the notes and slides of

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:34,120
that so to explain why a particular our

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,300
Iraq is needed when you're reporting in

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,680
okay

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,080
so we've talked about all of you

00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,300
separately right okay there's typography

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,710
classes and all of these things well how

00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,810
did you actually build a page with them

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:49,400
how do you build build components so

00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:50,570
that you need to make a site lookit you

00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,530
need to first make sure that these

00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:56,660
classes don't really overlap because if

00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,250
you have lots of classes that kind of do

00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,960
the same thing that's kind of overwrite

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,480
each other then you just end up there's

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,200
a little bit of a muddle and it takes a

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,420
while to for all the specificity stuff

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,780
try to avoid conflicts especially if you

00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,100
see as much as we can so just go with

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,610
things that the class society you don't

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:20,060
overlap so when we actually implement

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:22,280
them you can add these kind of classes

00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,650
and different combinations that builds

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:29,240
up your components so what does actually

00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:32,810
mean so for example here this is like

00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,570
example headline for example and the

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:37,520
font so the gel will salute gel is the

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,120
prefix for like the typography and

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,250
things like that

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,110
which is let's base in jail so gel

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,820
Waterloo is the typography size and

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,590
there's the bullet pattern because you

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,450
have the bullet icon in your text and

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,460
there's a marginal write to seem like

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,620
the live path as we like

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,840
so before there's like a lot of space

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,790
there thank you great so you've got this

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,980
for like save the main heading of your

00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,780
server your main page but what if you

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,720
wanted like a small heading further down

00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,640
do you need to actually redo this

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,670
component but with a smaller typography

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,130
and actually you do all you really need

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,810
to do is you replace that one class the

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,590
one typography class you replace the

00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:16,010
dill

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,720
what's a little Vidal pica and it just

00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,940
gets down

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,559
perfectly and it'll work so some

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,289
breakfast so you can actually just reuse

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:29,470
something we're just replacing that one

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:32,440
class okay so that was a bit about how

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,360
you build up things now we're talking a

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:45,309
bit more about how you can actually

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:48,909
localize the system right so what does

00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:50,860
the localization actually mean okay so

00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:52,330
you might think okay if it need to me

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,679
like as I need to write write stuff in a

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,780
different language what content needs to

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,419
be perhaps a different language so you

00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,280
might have your navigation saying like a

00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:02,860
home busing rules their home is in the

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,169
difference which Anu you might have a

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:08,590
different script UMass different

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:10,630
typography if your writing so for

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,350
example the BBC Arabic site has an

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:16,720
Arabic script so that's different and

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,980
layout so you might think okay wait wait

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,350
a minute why doesn't my whole layout

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,120
interchange that makes no sense I would

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,340
just rather have one layout and for it

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,590
to just work for everything that's

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,590
almost true that's why you can't do that

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,870
in lots of different circumstances

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,789
except some languages are right-to-left

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,130
and not just right and you might have

00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:38,380
hard-coded margin-left everywhere so

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,510
what do you do if something like that

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,250
just a bit like like how can you can

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,130
change this it's a property like how can

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,570
I have can you handle that so so it sort

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,669
through different different kind of

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,440
issues that are here and how with

00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:55,330
grandstand so you can resolve that you

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,789
can solve them okay so first I'll show

00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,919
you what it what the result is so these

00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:02,169
are like these slices of content so the

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,320
top line is in Thai and from Thai site

00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:08,700
and the bottom one is impatient to meet

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:11,500
steep Asian yes and then you can you can

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,679
for all the different kind of products

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,409
that you that we have the web service

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:20,590
sites you can also create places so you

00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:23,020
might notice that ty is left to right

00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:25,330
that's a heading there and the person

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,840
one is right to left so it looks kind of

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,470
thing

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,750
but you know under the hood they are

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:35,860
slightly different and let's talk about

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:38,020
why so so the first point on

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:41,530
localization was type what something

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:44,440
with typography life okay so let's look

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:46,060
at these two examples one less is in

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,910
English and then the one on the right is

00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,980
in Persian they have the same font size

00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:54,000
they have the same line height they have

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,710
the same all of that however if you read

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,800
through both languages you'll notice

00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,960
that it's actually much harder to read

00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,270
the text on the right because of the

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,160
style of the type of real word you need

00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,810
to kind of focus a lot more and it's

00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,180
just it's really like bunched together

00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,760
and things like that so it's more as a

00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:17,230
as a reader of that type by by just

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:19,180
having the typography that works well in

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,070
English and for latin scripts with the

00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,410
spacing between letters and pay online

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:26,650
and that doesn't really work when you've

00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:29,140
got different different scripts so it

00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,780
wouldn't work for a locker sort four or

00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,070
four become things and for us are the

00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,260
scripts so we've got different them

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,500
Chinese and Japanese and all sorts of

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,660
different scripts that we care about so

00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:43,240
what do you do

00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:47,920
so you actually adapt them depending on

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:53,340
with what setup cube if you decide okay

00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:56,590
now I'm actually I want the Latin CSS

00:23:53,340 --> 00:24:00,670
file and what can I do to get that right

00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:03,460
and if I want the Arabic script CSS what

00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:05,680
do I do to get that right there are a

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,800
few different things so the line Heights

00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:12,430
font sizes and H breakpoints so what we

00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:15,130
do in practice is that developers and UX

00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:18,010
designers less closely and usually with

00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:21,370
editorial staff so because not everybody

00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:24,160
in as multilingualism some of the team

00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:26,620
are not everyone speaks all 29 of the

00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,970
languages so it's usually best to get

00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,680
somebody from editorial you actually

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,960
speaks language to come out and give

00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,730
their opinion on whether it's clear or

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,130
not so yes so that

00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,600
so to get actual feedback woman is this

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,470
clear enough can you see it well in your

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:47,540
salon you're fit mobile phone so we

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:50,090
localize typography sir so about the

00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:53,450
grid what does that mean to localize a

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:55,220
grid so you might have noticed ferns in

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,110
Seleucia certain grants are definitely

00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,830
in the grid we've got direction left to

00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,240
right and we have text-align:left to

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,270
make sure the text is aligned properly

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,929
to the side of the side of the page side

00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,970
of what block but what do you do when if

00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:12,799
you want to create if you want to just

00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:15,679
swap it so that the fifth component

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,929
works with everything on the right well

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,820
what we use and we have users not

00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:21,410
specific grants and we use the elf

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,530
flower and the previous iterations of

00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:27,340
the site but it is in Gulu included here

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:31,850
in grandstand is this the split function

00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:35,030
so it's it's the function that you it

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,760
takes two parameters if it's like if the

00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:40,220
site is left to right which is in most

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,130
of our sites are like the all but four

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,080
of them all over so like 20 25 of the

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,929
sites are left to right so we kind of

00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,080
default to that being the main default

00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:53,780
selector right system and if it's not if

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:58,100
it's right to left so that Arabic pÃªche

00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:01,820
do and will do and Persian and then we

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:04,429
choose the value the second value second

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,590
argument so this is a function as a

00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:09,440
whole so takes two values in if

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,679
right-to-left is true then return the

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,570
right to left value in all other cases

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,809
you return the first one so so just like

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:21,700
a single like if statement since to make

00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:24,650
that work and that is really useful so

00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:28,010
so yeah so so basically that will double

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:30,130
flip so all of your values you can flip

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,840
them around so they work out of the box

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,220
but what happens to properties well if

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,110
you've actually got a property with

00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,110
margin right how do you make that work

00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:44,389
so in a school setting you use that

00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:46,849
right to left is false

00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:49,190
initially for example and the margin

00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:53,029
right value start off with for example

00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:55,429
is this margin right and if if it's

00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:57,440
actually right to left so in an Arabic

00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:59,779
case or for personal cases or all of

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,389
these cases it just flips the value

00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:05,539
around so that value becomes the the

00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:09,619
opposite story and that just kind of

00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:11,629
works which is cool and so yeah so same

00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:14,809
with margin same with padding you just

00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:17,509
you interpolate it with that syntax so

00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:22,279
the hash brackets telephones and and

00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:24,649
then it works that way so those are the

00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:26,059
two ways the first one is to have in

00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:28,159
something the value is the second one is

00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:33,440
how to interpret for properties to

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:37,609
localize them cool ok so let's talk

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,619
about how it can be localized a little

00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:41,839
bit of that reusability and the

00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:43,489
lightweight being lightweight because

00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,509
we're reusing all of these classes they

00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:47,359
don't overlap so you don't need to

00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:50,299
override a lot of things all the time ok

00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,859
so that's a bit of a tour about that how

00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:54,139
do you actually get started building

00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:55,729
your own and why would you want to build

00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:59,329
your own can't you just use this out of

00:27:55,729 --> 00:28:00,979
the box well a lot of stuff you can some

00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:04,249
of the colors say you might not want to

00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:06,709
start your sites the BBC News red you

00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:08,929
might want to have your own colors or

00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:11,359
the object patterns you you might

00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:13,009
realize when looking at the style of

00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,409
designs that you that you want to have

00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:17,959
on your site that you don't really have

00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:20,149
lots of I con next to text that you have

00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:21,769
you have lots of images next to like big

00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:23,599
chunks of text although just lot it

00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:25,429
something else that you might want to

00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,289
abstract into it into a different

00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:29,749
pattern you just basically look at what

00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:33,979
you what you want to use a lot and

00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:38,089
decide what patterns are worth pulling

00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:39,650
out so that they're reusable ok so

00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:42,890
building your good

00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:44,960
jaren grandstand so to set up it's

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,870
really cool really important and free

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:53,510
useful she set the standard spacing unit

00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:55,820
so no more one pixel Edison yes this has

00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:57,440
been a bit of a point of contention but

00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,150
everyone's now kind of slightly on board

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,800
because it becomes more more unified

00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:04,120
across across different pages and

00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,020
different components just good

00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,280
breakpoints on time for presenting this

00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,170
will this would be like a whole other

00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,120
tool in itself and probably somebody who

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:14,210
will they use experience to have a

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,550
background it will be best to let safe

00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,320
to talk about it but really you'd want

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:20,750
to have very points that are suited to

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,450
your context so if you've got lots of

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:26,870
text that that you break it up in

00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:30,140
there's enough as enough of spacing

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:32,390
between the two even lines of text and

00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:35,270
things like that so that's like a whole

00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:37,429
arts and science in itself and your

00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,320
color palettes so yes you don't want to

00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:42,080
just be clumps with the BBC news read as

00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,650
much as everybody I'm sure loves it you

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,600
you feel choose your own right and for

00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:50,450
localization then you'll have the

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,809
traffic census variables and typography

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:56,300
sizes styles and sizes so the things we

00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:58,220
talked about you can just use the ones

00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,600
from grandson come over because they

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:05,059
should be just like a little box for

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:07,670
your posts as well right and kind of sum

00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:08,360
over how to make sure you keep it

00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,610
lightweight

00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,280
I think this is very important because

00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:16,370
and we we start off with the system it's

00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,960
very sensitive easy to to just keep

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,480
adding to it because you like great it

00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,890
works it's awesome let's just go any I

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,380
thought this other use case let me just

00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,820
add that one thing and all that's like a

00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,500
few months later there's another you see

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,840
it let me add that other one thing and

00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,730
then it could end up being a really not

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,110
lightweight this sort of pretty heavy

00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:38,420
assistance so so really the discussions

00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:41,780
to have and I do say discussions even if

00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:43,940
it is as to yourself or with other

00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,740
teammates as do you really need that

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,330
extra variation is there any way that

00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,590
you can use the current building blocks

00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:54,140
to get close to what you need

00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:56,520
and and finally and I think most

00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,160
importantly is communicating with others

00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,040
so if you're a developer to communicate

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,440
constantly into the designers and a

00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,940
product advocate your users so in our

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,810
case that can be editor or it can be

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:13,470
like like you us users and can you think

00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:15,780
you taking on feedback and even if you

00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,510
are actually working by yourself and

00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:22,890
it's their own project communicating to

00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:24,840
future you if such an important and it's

00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:28,680
such an important thing and I don't

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:31,470
think can be like overestimated business

00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,510
because you will write a class you will

00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,610
add something to add ie 11 support and

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,230
you will forget six months down the line

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,730
if you don't add a comment next to it

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,470
and you'll be like why do I need this I

00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,040
should remove this to cake mix my CSS

00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:46,050
lightly and you break I 11 support so

00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,930
yes so we definitely like to communicate

00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,250
to our future selves so we add comments

00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:53,340
and things throughout our code and

00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:55,020
install that helps of onboarding us last

00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,220
so so many members of your team and

00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,140
things or if you want to share your

00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,060
project with other people online and

00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,560
that they can understand that you're

00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:06,410
coming from on what the citizens you've

00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:09,210
made and why you've made them so yes so

00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:11,790
so to kind of sum up so we talked a lot

00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,860
about BBC grants and what are all the

00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:18,000
different sections and and why they're

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:20,490
needed how it enables sites to me like

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,080
lightweight reusable and their

00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,860
collidable like all of your little

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,890
components and how you can get started

00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,220
with building your room say thank you

00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,220
very much

00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,670
