Title: CSSconf EU 2017 | Glen Maddern: The road to styled components: CSS in component-based systems

Description: 
	Building user interfaces on the web is hard, because the web, and thus CSS, was inherently made for documents. Because UIs fundamentally are not documents, we've seen a mindset shift towards building component-based system.

The rise of JavaScript frameworks like React, Ember and recently Angular 2, the effort of the W3C to standardize a web-native component system, pattern libraries and styleguides being considered 'the right way to build web applications' and many other things have illuminated this revolution â€“ we are now in the "Component Age".

With that and a few more things in mind, Max along with Glen Maddern (co-creator of css-modules) sat down and started thinking about styling in this new era. They took the best of CSS and the Web to build a new way to style component-based systems. In this talk, Glen (stepping in last minute for Max!)  will share what they thought about and why they arrived where they did: styled-components.
