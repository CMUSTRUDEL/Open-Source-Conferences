Title: CSSconf EU 2017 | Una Kravets: Let’s Build a CSS Game
Publication date: 2017-06-02
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2017
Description: 
	http://2017.cssconf.eu/speakers/una-kravets.html

Let’s live code a game together using just CSS and HTML! This talk will demonstrate the power of CSS and will teach a few fun tips as tricks as we build a simple game. It’ll be based in Sass — using data structures like matrices and HTML counter-incrementing, and a little bit of web magic to tie it all together. This talk will inspire you to play with and create your own CSS games, pushing the boundaries of what’s expected from the language itself.

[Music]

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:18,449
hello thank you so much for having me

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,949
I'm super super excited to be here this

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,080
is one of my absolute favorite

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,449
conferences and this is such a massive

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,949
and awesome audience so thank you give

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:32,009
yourselves all a round of applause

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:34,350
I love CSS comps because it honestly

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,719
feels like this giant family we're all

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,660
interviews really nerdy things we're all

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,370
into them together and it really just

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,079
feels like this big family so I wanted

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,430
to announce something that I've been

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,440
working on so the past couple of months

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,789
almost a year that kind of feels like my

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,070
baby and this is the only appropriate

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,020
place to announce it I'm writing a book

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,410
called the front end developers

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,690
guidebook I just had to announce up here

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,460
cuz I love all of you so this is about

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,649
front-end development everything from

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,320
soft skills like how to learn about side

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,260
projects and make time to technical

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,210
skills all foundations also

00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,670
internationalisation SEO accessibility

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,750
performance all those things so for

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,060
doing that for a while I'm working with

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,460
a publisher is smashing and it'll be out

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,040
soon there's a lot of practical stuff in

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,689
this book but in this talk we'll flip

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,119
that over and we'll end this conference

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,460
with more of a party mode we're going to

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,150
write a CSS game but don't worry we'll

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,619
go over some something for you to learn

00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,180
we'll talk about SAS data structures

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,140
there's going to be a lot of sass

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,610
involved in this

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,799
we heard some really good talks about

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,200
CSS and JavaScript this is going to be

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,939
writing functional programs inside of

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,310
sass itself we're going to kind of flip

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,600
that script a bit we're going to do some

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,820
pixel art we're actually going to create

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,470
some generative pixel art based on

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,909
things that were writing individually

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,450
inside of staff so that will be some fun

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:57,060
we'll do some functions and loops will

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,640
talk about grid very briefly we'll learn

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,380
about some pointer events CSS animation

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,270
and basically how to crash your web

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,189
browser because none of these things are

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,810
really great for production but they're

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,610
great for making games for having fun

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,770
for experimenting with CSS so let's meet

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,730
our cast have you seen these

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,580
people around these are our lovely

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:22,170
organizers and MC is here today and I

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,030
wanted to kind of bring them in the game

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,010
I wanted to give him high fives for the

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,860
awesome job that they did putting this

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,550
together I was also inspired by Mario so

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,430
I thought maybe I could get the cast of

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,260
her game put them into Mario and make

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,460
some magic happen so we're going to do

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,870
that I brought them into illustrator

00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,400
first and I mapped out pixel by pixel

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,040
exactly what I wanted them to look like

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,910
and I translated them to map so we rehab

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,250
Paulie Kevin Tim Christina you got

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:57,120
Jessica and once this is all said and

00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:01,020
done if all works out well we will have

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,290
created this CSS comp high-fives game oh

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,660
gosh has been going a little crazy so

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,240
last for eight seconds it counts up our

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,900
points all of this is done in just CSS I

00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,790
am going to use gulp to essentially just

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,230
run browser sync so that you're not

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,620
waiting for me while I'm doing this and

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:22,140
also runs off but yeah let's get started

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,490
this all boils down to CSS and HTML so

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,440
the first thing we wanted to do is build

00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,090
those characters but those characters

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,830
are going to take a while doing them

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,290
pixel by pixel so we'll do a little bit

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,700
of a simplified demo with a heart first

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,950
thing we want to do is hook this into

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,760
the HTML with a clasp we'll call this

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,709
class pixelize heart I'm using EMA so I

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,900
just hit tab it creates that for me then

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,850
I want to open my heart F CSS and get

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,459
started next thing that we want to do is

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,740
create a map of color so thus they want

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,900
to use red and transparent we can map

00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,450
this with a key and a value so we can

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,140
map this with ofer transparent and then

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,340
we can use our for red cool so now we

00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,290
know what colors we're going to

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,030
correlate our pixels to the second thing

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,550
that we can do is determine the size of

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,750
the pixels so let's make this 20s a

00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,209
little bit easier to see for all you out

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,370
there now what we can do is start

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,380
creating this pixel art I have a map

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,970
called pixel art it's a variable and I'm

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,680
going to have multiple maps inside of

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,720
that map so I'm going to call this map

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,310
heart and that's going to be a map

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,530
itself and we're going to create this by

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,720
adding multiple lines that are included

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,060
in parentheses determine the number of

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,740
rows that we have

00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,030
going to have six rows it's going to

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,200
look something like this and they're

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,960
going to fill those with the pixels that

00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,100
we're expecting to have trust me there's

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,560
a method to my madness

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,770
you can then go through and draw out all

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,150
these pixels individually like you would

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,650
see in a heart and I know that you can't

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,080
see it yet but in a moment I can

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,300
highlight all these Reds and show you

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,780
what it's going to look like in a moment

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,880
so here I am just drawing this out and I

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,210
could see that I've aired here so I'm

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,620
going to fix that and really you can

00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,900
just set these colors you can apply

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,700
multiple colors you can create like

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,320
stripes if I want to if I could add more

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,660
colors to the list but when I highlight

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,580
the Reds you can see very lightly that

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,010
I've created a heart out of OHS and ours

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,260
to create this pixel map so we have our

00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:15,080
heart pixel map but now we need to read

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,850
through this entire map to pull out

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,979
those pixels what we're going to be

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,710
using here is box shadow because box

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:23,750
shadow is really easy to hack and it

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,180
allows us to give an unlimited number of

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,260
arguments in the property list itself so

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,270
we can have an unlimited number of

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,789
arguments and we can place them based on

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,539
an x and y coordinates from the top left

00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:37,160
as pixel values so let's just make this

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:39,950
let's write that function because we can

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,289
write functions in that so inside of

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,300
here I'm going to say we first are going

00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:46,310
to generate the shadow list so we can

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,470
create an empty string to begin with and

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,750
we'll fill that as we go and then we're

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,580
going to also need to get the road so as

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,700
I mentioned earlier the roads is going

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,340
to be the length of the matrix since we

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,260
have six of these one two three four

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,350
five six going down that's going to then

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,820
denote the roads for our entire matrix

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,340
and we can iterate through those roads

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,840
to get the actual row number so in SAS

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:15,860
we can also use a for-loop

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:19,010
at four row from one through the number

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,770
of rows here so here I'm going to use

00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,750
rows and variable that we just set I'm

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,669
going to set that row number so it's

00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,919
just going to be row num and then we can

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:30,770
use the int value to pull that in to the

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,360
nth value of the matrix and the row so

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,000
now we know what the actual row number

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,650
is that we have landed on now we can

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,580
filter that again and get the column

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,860
number

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,520
the column is going to be at 4:00 call

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,720
from one through the length of the row

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,150
number because that means that we're

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,639
going to go through all nine values that

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,860
are in that row and get the column value

00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,479
and finally we can see where the dot is

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,319
so from that we can see if the dot is

00:06:53,479 --> 00:07:02,330
the end value of the row number in the

00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:05,090
column so now we know if we are in an R

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,460
or an O value once we have that we can

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,009
start building this shadow list of you

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,419
have so the shadow list then becomes the

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:14,120
shadow list this is how you append in

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,979
SAS plus the values that were pulling

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,469
from here so we can get the exposition

00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:20,949
by using size the pixel value that we

00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:23,659
set us twenty pixels times the column

00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:26,539
plus me to have a space here for the

00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:30,770
syntax of drop shadow plus the size

00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:32,479
times the row and from here we can get

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,029
the color so we also want to add another

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,039
space we want to then map guess which is

00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:38,810
how we access items inside of the map

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,629
itself we're going to access from the

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,849
colors map and then use the dot value to

00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:45,560
pull in either transparent or red now

00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:48,379
we're converting that from a no earn are

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,180
to transparent or red we're almost done

00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:52,639
with this item the shadow list but next

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,199
we then have to add a comma we have to

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,060
have a comma between every single item

00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:57,800
in this list except for the very last

00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,389
item because if the last item has a

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,210
comma it'll invalidate and it won't show

00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:07,460
up so we have to do a negated if

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:10,250
statement so let's say at if not how is

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,629
equal to the length of row num which

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,229
means that we're at the very last item

00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:19,599
right number nine and rest the very last

00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:22,520
row so we can say Rho is equal to Rose

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,219
then we want to add a comma then the

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,669
shadow list becomes the shadow list plus

00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:30,529
a comma cool so the last thing I want to

00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:33,949
do is return a value we have to use at

00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:36,860
return unquote because currently it is

00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:38,449
still a string that we have unquote the

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,039
shadow list and we can finally return a

00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:41,810
value so nothing is going to appear

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,060
until we actually use it inside of our

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,529
div that we created in the page so let's

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,540
make this an after pseudo element and

00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,459
then apply any of the height and of

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,460
width first so the height can be the

00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:54,600
size and the width

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,430
can be the size and we want to give us a

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,380
content since it's a after suit helmet

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,590
this is going to be very fast ESS so I

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,910
apologize about all of the like improper

00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,500
placement of all these things if you

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,810
always make sure they're nice and neat

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,640
and orderly and inside the box and we

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,770
can use a function on the right hand

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,030
side of the property so here we'll use

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,550
our function which is called pixel eyes

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:17,490
and we need to map yet because again the

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:21,210
heart map is inside of another map so

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:25,620
we're going to map get pixel art yep

00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:28,050
pixel art is our a sort of map of our

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,970
map map get pixel art and heart and then

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,070
we're going to send the size value again

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,410
which is default and it's set globally

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,510
here so once I save this our heart will

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:40,100
appear appears in the screen I somehow

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,100
didn't mess up that's great

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,330
the next thing I'm going to do is step

00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,279
in set this I'm going to use this

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,500
ampersand which acts as an anchor in

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,210
sass so what will happen here is I can

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,980
edit pixelized Hart give it some

00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:59,100
properties and it still has six pies

00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,110
Hart after setup in there I'm going to

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,410
give this an outline so I can debug this

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:06,480
a line 1px solid as you see that this

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,980
element is not taking up any space on

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,990
the page because we haven't given it a

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,360
width or a height and that's not great

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,790
if you want to use this within our game

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,710
itself it has to take up some space so

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:21,810
first I want to give a special relative

00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:23,040
oh and I then want to give it a width

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,570
and height and I'm going to be using

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,070
that based on the size that we've

00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,380
dynamically created in this nature

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:31,920
because we can also set the size so I'm

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,660
going to give it a height and the height

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,240
again is the length that matrix times

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,250
the size so get the pixel size and

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,980
multiply it by the length of that matrix

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,589
and in this case the matrix is map get

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:47,040
pixel art Hart copy that paste it in

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,690
there and then height the width is going

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,460
to be the length of one of those columns

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,310
so since we're out inside that loop

00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,470
again we can get the size and the length

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,210
of just one of those columns so we're

00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,180
going to have to map get one of them and

00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:03,330
use that nth value again to say ends of

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:07,020
this matrix and the first column because

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:09,300
why not so say that and it is now

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,860
properly placed but you can see that

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,720
it's shifted over and the reason why is

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,850
because black shadow starts at the

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,380
bottom right corner of the div it starts

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,020
at the end of it so now we have to shift

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:22,320
this up so we can say top of negative

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,900
size maybe left of negative size and

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,959
boom our heart is placed inside of the

00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,940
div as we expected based on this heart

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:34,400
that we just created out of literally

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:40,080
letters on the screen together here so

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:43,170
we can then take this idea and open

00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,750
something like I have a character's SCSS

00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,730
where I already did this and I'm going

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,820
to just uncomment and zoom out of here

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:53,550
so you can see what the characters

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,920
actually look like my vision is forever

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,310
ruined but it's fine

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,410
so if I

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,860
save this and then I open I have a

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,420
characters file you can see all the

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,010
characters have appeared out of this

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,470
generated map and you can dynamically

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,110
change the colors so like if I wanted to

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:15,250
go into here and I wanted to change all

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:17,650
of the black to like a red because why

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,330
not once I save this instantly it'll all

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,370
change so you can just create this art

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,380
dynamically in your browser and it's

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,540
really fun to play with you can also

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,190
animate this if you're a masochist

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,860
and want to make your browser run really

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,430
slowly it wouldn't recommend animating

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,790
box-shadow

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:36,130
but it is an option so the next thing we

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,630
want to do is keep some score we have

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,600
our characters but we don't really have

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:43,750
our game set so we have to create like

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,790
our entire game area in here we're going

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,760
to use Emmet to make this really quick

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,740
for ourselves I'm going to have a list

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,460
so just UL and that list is going to

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,290
have a class of game area and then

00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,630
within that I want to have a couple of

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,330
list items so I can say that I want to

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,680
have a list item next to that I want to

00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,630
have an input it's going to be a

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,610
checkbox so it's going to type equals

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,230
checkbox this is going to be our click

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,240
area that we're going to use to sort of

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,430
make sure that we've counted up these

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,970
points from once we click we'll count up

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,560
the points

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,600
next to that we have a div and it's

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,700
going to be a character and with Emmet

00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,460
you can just do times three hit tab and

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,440
now I have this list and within it I

00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,540
have these three list items inside the

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,310
list item I have an input and I have our

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,080
character nothing is going to show up

00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:33,070
until I go through and make sure that I

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:35,350
add a little character so here I can say

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,600
pixel eyes maybe we'll have a Kevin in

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,630
there we can have three Kevin's or I can

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,080
mix this up and add like let's add poly

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:46,180
here let's add a Christina on our screen

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,440
and now all of our characters are happy

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:51,339
and have appeared and they're ready for

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,050
high fives also with these boxes you can

00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:54,400
add a border radius make them round you

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,680
can make them bigger or smaller based on

00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,209
the pixel size it's four pixels here but

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,150
it really allows for a variety of

00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:03,040
options that you can play around with so

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,170
we also want to add a place for our

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,360
score to show up here so we can just

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,060
have an h2 with a score and then inside

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,290
of that lets get a span with a class of

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,620
score that will access

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,899
later to show our points go zoom out

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,600
there a little you know with this screen

00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:22,660
here alright so the next thing we want

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,910
to do is then open a new CSS file just

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,120
to keep it organized we're going to open

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,480
our game play s CSS so game plays it's

00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,670
called

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,889
I've opened this now we need to design

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,529
this click area so that's not just a

00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:37,899
small check box over there so we can

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,319
just quickly edit this maybe give it a

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:43,779
position of absolute so that it shows

00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:48,910
within its parent there we can give it a

00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:50,649
display:block and then we can do some

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,230
things like give it an outline so we can

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:55,050
debug this this is my favorite way to

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,269
debug because outline doesn't take any

00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,279
space on the page whereas border does so

00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:02,079
I have that outlined maybe I want to

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:03,850
give it a width of 40 pixels and a

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,250
height of 40 pixels so you can see it

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,819
it's currently behind the characters I

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,529
believe so we need to give it a Z index

00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:12,790
the index of three could work at this

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:15,040
point I'd probably want to create a Z

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,480
index map and then use that to adjust

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,949
accordingly so that everything is

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,199
orderly but like I said we're just going

00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:22,630
to speed right this game and then here I

00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:25,209
can do appearance none to get rid of

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:28,149
that checkbox this works really well in

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:30,579
WebKit and in Chrome does not work in

00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:32,649
Firefox so you would have to create a

00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:35,380
span that surrounds your check box style

00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:37,000
that span and have appearance none on

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,589
your check not a parent son you have to

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,839
have a display of nominative checkbox in

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,190
order to make this work in Firefox so

00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,079
everything else will be identical except

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,430
for this little quick area I also want

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,040
to give us a top of like negative 10

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:51,670
pixels and a left of like negative 5 so

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,040
that it just positions nicely maybe you

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,360
want to give it a tap of 10 so once I've

00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,459
done that when I click on it now you

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,290
can't tell that it clicked on it so we

00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:01,300
need to make sure that there's some kind

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,649
of feedback mechanism I don't even know

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,540
that I can hover over it because the

00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:07,060
cursor hasn't changed so a really nice

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,399
cursor for this is called grab because

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,660
it's like a little hand you I don't know

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,220
if you could see you here basic a little

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,899
hand hovering here that's a little hand

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,699
for the high-five so that was good we

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:17,740
now know that we're hovering and maybe

00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:20,800
we want to add a property of if it's

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,660
checked given like a background of green

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,150
or something so we know we clicked on it

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,100
ok cool so we know now what's things

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,050
what's not we can get rid of this we'll

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,720
deal with that later we can get rid of

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,700
this outline great let's count up some

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,230
points so here we currently have score

00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,060
and we have a span next to it with a

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,160
class of score that has nothing in it

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,870
because we haven't provided any value

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,510
but we can do this with a property

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,160
called counter increment in CSS counter

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,600
increment was originally intended for

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,730
outlines when you have an unlimited

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,620
amount of data that you're counting up

00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,960
and you want to be able to just

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,120
increment it up we can use counter

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,700
increments in our game to check where we

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,370
have our check boxes and apply the value

00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,960
put it out on the game so inside of

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,360
score we can give it an after clear

00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,100
element with content and the content

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,689
that we're spending over that we're

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,720
pulling some Dom sending over is going

00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:14,050
to be the counter of a game so once I

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,300
save this zero will appear because we

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:20,350
don't have any points yet on the game

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,910
and we can mitigate that by adding the

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:27,400
rest of the things that matter so the

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:30,100
game area needs a counter reset of game

00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,490
we're naming it here and then after that

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:40,420
we want to give the Kliq area when it is

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:42,700
checked a counter increment of game when

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,980
I say that now once I've clicked on

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,040
these you'll see that it's starting to

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,540
count up our score so counter increment

00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,100
can be used for that if you want to make

00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,280
this game even challenging we can also

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,500
use a decrement catta increment is won

00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,809
by nature but you can customize it so

00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,240
you can add multiple points negative

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:04,330
points and really play this up we want

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,770
to make it challenging so we do want to

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,240
make it more challenging not in that way

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,280
but we want to add a shield because

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,610
right now I can just click on all of

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,070
these and count up and I win so let's go

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,510
back into our index let's you know get

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,820
rid of some of this stuff I'm going to

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:21,580
say that to my clipboard because we want

00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,740
to add a shield inside of our list we

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,960
still have this unordered list with a

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,610
class of game area inside of that we

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,260
still have our list item but instead of

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,660
having it directly next to the input and

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,540
click area of the character we want to

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,240
wrap that inside of a character wrapper

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:41,020
so let's say we're going to say dot care

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,059
sir wrapper and then next to that we

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,830
want to have a shield so we're going to

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,870
have a shield plus a character wrapper

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,360
and maybe we want to have nine of those

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,669
so once I hit tab now I have my list

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,260
item with the shield a character wrapper

00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:55,690
inside of the character wrapper we have

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,090
our checkbox aka our click area we have

00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,010
our characters and we're ready to go and

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,510
make this game what it is we also have 9

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,820
of them so we can make kind of a grid a

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:07,149
3x3 grid and here I can go through and

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:09,880
add pixelized characters let's have all

00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:11,230
of the Tim's just lines right up know

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,080
about all the other characters here

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:18,870
let's add a Jessica let's add a

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:23,919
Christina let's here let's add a Kevin

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:26,110
let's see Poli there might be a few

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,730
multiple multiples so they're all here

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,200
we have four times in a row but it's

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,200
fine he likes to give high fives we'll

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,120
just leave that so they're all kind of

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,620
on top of each other I'm actually going

00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,539
to change them because it looks looks a

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,279
little crowded they're all on top of

00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:41,200
each other we want to arrange them on

00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,320
the screen here so we're going to use

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,919
some CSS grid fun have you all used CSS

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,380
grid for how many of you used it I'm

00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:53,350
seeing like a quarter of you it's really

00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,590
amazing like oh it just gives me the

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,899
shivers I love CSS grid okay so we have

00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,820
our click area right and the first thing

00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:03,340
that we want to do is give it a display

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,289
of grid I'm first going to style the

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,149
list items so that you can see it and

00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:08,830
see what's happening here I'm going to

00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:11,919
give it a background of Dodger blue

00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:14,919
unlike the papaya whip that Glen's like

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,320
I am a Dodger blue kind of girl so we

00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:20,409
have that color I'm going to then go

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,240
back into our grid and applies the magic

00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:23,440
nothing is happening yet but when I give

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,270
it a grid template it's just

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,909
automatically going to fall into place

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,740
I want that 3x3 grid so I'm going to

00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:32,110
just use the fractional unit which says

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,539
cake up as much of this remaining space

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,130
as possible within this fractional unit

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:38,230
so if I use one it's going to all be

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,990
even to each other and then I can say I

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:43,720
want one two three rows and then I want

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,909
one two three columns you can also use a

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,320
repeat property inside of grid to do

00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:49,750
this but it's a little bit more clear

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,590
right now if I just do when fr one Fr

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:57,440
went too far

00:20:50,590 --> 00:21:00,140
okay so this isn't moving but I'm

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,670
wondering what I wrote wrong when I fire

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:08,750
over one well let's let's find out as I

00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:11,480
save this out the the board isn't giving

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:16,960
me a background here either let's see if

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,960
I I spell something wrong what is it

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,800
click area you're right it's game area

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,850
that's exactly this is why I love you

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,440
all you're sitting in front of me

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,180
awesome so if I give it the correct

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,860
class name you know live coding who

00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,380
thought something could go wrong

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,350
it appears powerfully as I expected and

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:36,440
then here I can give it a grid gap of

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:39,260
say like 20 pixels and only the space

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,180
between the pixels moves it's like magic

00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,490
nothing on the outside we don't have to

00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,730
work with these like weird end values or

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,680
last child hacks it just works the way

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,660
you expect it to and now we're going to

00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,760
do that mysterious second biggest

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,650
problem of computer science and Center

00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,870
things so we're going to vertically

00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:00,920
align this with display flex we're going

00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:05,090
to do a line items Center and we're

00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:07,280
going to do justify content center here

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,590
so once I save that all these elements

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,800
will be kind of aligned within the space

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,390
we're going to then use some margins

00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,270
here to center this area we're going to

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:20,060
give it a width of like a tvw and a

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,980
height of say a tvw and then we want to

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,210
do a margin so you're Auto so it's

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,120
centered inner screen and looks a little

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,490
bit nicer here cool we've got that now

00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,870
we have this shield so I just pre wrote

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,090
it because it's just placement

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,770
background with height absolute

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,910
positioning but we have it in front of

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,460
our character so when you click you

00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:40,100
can't access that hand unless you go a

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,990
little higher to get that score value up

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,450
we want to bring the score back into

00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:48,080
here so let's go ahead and add that back

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:50,930
in and when I click up you'll see that I

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:55,160
can reach the hand here but not here so

00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:57,050
we'll needs to go back in to our board

00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,060
or our game play file to make this even

00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,390
harder because we can still tally up

00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,130
these points it's

00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,630
not something of challenging until we

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,170
make it challenging and we can do that

00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,549
by using some animations so let's go

00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,070
back into this file and add some CSS

00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:13,740
animations we can use keyframes to do

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,750
this we're going to say keyframes of

00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,760
move because we don't have to be

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,260
creative we'll just really quickly come

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,830
up with a name I'm going to have this go

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,900
from 0% to 50% because at 60% I'm going

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,429
to have it alternate and it's just going

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,679
to go like a little bounce so we're

00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:31,650
going from 0 to 100 and I'm going to use

00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,870
a transform property to move this in a

00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,580
way that it's going to translate why to

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,850
move up and down so I'm going to say

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,890
it's transform translate Y and it's

00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:44,160
going to go from negative 25 pixels to

00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:47,960
25 pixels I'm going to apply this to

00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:51,720
both the character and the click area

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:55,110
this animation which is a move I'm going

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,640
to say is 0.5 seconds it's going to be

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,669
forever they're going to be jumping up

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,740
at us infinite and it's going to be

00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:02,940
alternating for that bounce and it's

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,820
going to be moving forward because we

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,340
want the paint to move forward all right

00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,260
going to save that and now our

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,210
characters are all jumping up at the

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,400
same rate ready to give us high-five it

00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:17,010
is much harder now to click and to grab

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,690
them while they're up there but it's

00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:21,419
still kind of weird that our characters

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,660
are all moving at the same rate here on

00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:26,669
the screen so we can now use another for

00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,750
loop in sass but instead of doing it

00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:29,460
inside of our class we're going to

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,970
generate our classes within the for loop

00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:35,580
so let's say at 4 we'll use i from 1

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,080
through 9 which is the number of

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,970
characters that we have you can also use

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,890
a variable for this we'll set a speed

00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,900
and here we can use a sass random

00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,299
function within this to create different

00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,750
animation durations different speeds for

00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:51,450
our characters so let's use random and

00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,950
we'll do random times like 1.5 and then

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,870
we have to add the second so that it

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,630
knows what we're using here for the

00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,840
duration so now we can say we want our

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:02,610
list items and we can use end child a

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,980
selector we're going to interpolate that

00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,720
I variable so we can use it within this

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,880
class name this class like that we're

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,740
creating here and inside of that we want

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,140
to give it the speed so here we're going

00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,960
to say for all the characters and all of

00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,930
the click area

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,330
within this list item with an end of 1

00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:24,000
through 9 we are going to change up the

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,560
animation duration and overwrite it to

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,870
be again interpolating that speed

00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:31,170
variable hit save and now they will all

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:35,550
be moving at different rates hope we got

00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:38,820
an excited Tim and Kevin here mmm maybe

00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:41,280
I like this 2.5 alright that's a little

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,770
bit better Tim is still very excited to

00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,120
be playing this game so this is starting

00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,310
to look more like what we're expecting

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,960
but we still are going to ultimately

00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,180
always be winning because we don't have

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,670
a time limit yet so let's add a time

00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,070
limit we go back into our index we can

00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,020
then create a class like a stopper class

00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:59,820
so we'll create a stopper and inside

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:04,020
this will have like an h3 that says game

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:06,300
over sorry and we'll save that and then

00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,800
we can go into our board I have it here

00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,470
again so I could just uncomment that

00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,300
it's currently just on our page but what

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,820
this is doing is its styling it so that

00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,710
is being an override of the page it's

00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,960
taking the full width and height getting

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,460
that background of cyan I'm increasing

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,800
the font size a little bit for styling

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,020
purposes but now we want to move this

00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:29,130
off of the page so we want to do H

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:31,440
transform translate Y of negative 100 Z

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,360
H so it just moves off the page and we

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,370
want that to eventually appear in when

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,890
we want thing to move in CSS we have to

00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:41,550
add an animation so let's add that let's

00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:43,950
do a keyframe for stopper we'll name the

00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:47,550
animation stopper and we'll do a from

00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:50,070
init to here and we can use this value

00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:53,190
this transform translate why so we

00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:56,370
wanted to move from negative 100 V H to

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,140
0 V H so it goes back to the original

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,750
location on the page there's kind of

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,130
like that reverse animation that we

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,230
heard about before with some of those

00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,560
awesome data visualizations so we're

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,520
going to apply this to our stopper we're

00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,520
going to say we want to add an animation

00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,290
of stopper make that 0.5 seconds this

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,700
could also be a variable really great

00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,200
for you're creating style systems to

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,600
variable eyes your animations they have

00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,980
the same look and feel to them also with

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,840
your Bezier curves and any kind of

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,310
animation curve you have there I'm just

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,050
using linear for now so I'm leaving it

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,100
at its default and so I have this

00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,370
animation I also

00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:32,220
on the paint to go forward so it ends as

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:33,539
it goes so I save this is pops in but

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,850
that's a very short game the game is

00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:37,140
like less than half of a second long so

00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,480
they can use this animation delay

00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,160
property to make our game

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,559
eight seconds longer or something like

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,750
that so once i refresh this page it's

00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,490
going to take eight seconds and tell the

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,660
animation stops working and I want to

00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,860
pull this out into a game link variable

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,630
so we're going to have a game length be

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,490
eight seconds and then I can diffuse

00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,770
that and use that and propagate it

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,480
through the rest so if you have noticed

00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:03,000
we've lost our score the score is now

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,940
behind our stopper because we haven't

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,039
styled it yet an entire score is an h2

00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,679
don't fight me on this it's just a demo

00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:13,770
yes you should namespace all of these

00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,020
things but we then want to style at h2

00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:20,010
that appears above we're just going to

00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:23,159
do a z-index here of ten we are going to

00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,419
give it a position:relative and then

00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,789
we're going to also give this an

00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:29,070
animation we want this to appear but not

00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:32,250
from negative 100 to zero we want this

00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:35,520
to appear from zero to negative fifty VH

00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:37,350
because that way it can pop in and kind

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,710
of go in with this game over

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:45,360
so I haven't applied this yet oh gosh

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:50,059
this is at the top of the page I think

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,059
just title this has to be positioned oh

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:56,070
that's why okay so this this needs to be

00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:57,929
scored we haven't applied this yet we're

00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,400
going to apply it here when we apply

00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:01,250
this animation you're my favorite person

00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,720
in here right now thank you

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,850
so here we go we're going to apply the

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,289
stopper we're going to have it have the

00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,570
same animations laid but maybe we want

00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,460
to add like 0.25 seconds so it occurs a

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:15,419
little bit later than the last one and

00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,309
so once we play this refresh after eight

00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:19,350
seconds the first one will appear after

00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:20,820
eight point two five seconds the second

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:25,049
one will appear and we'll have a nice

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:28,039
little pop in effect for this game so

00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:31,679
that appears that way I want this to

00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:35,419
continue to look a little nicer so we

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:38,419
can do some more things here by applying

00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:41,639
some um

00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:43,559
some notifications you've clicked on the

00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:44,999
characters like right now if I'm playing

00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,340
this game I clicking on the characters

00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:49,559
they're still moving around you don't

00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,409
really get any feedback the UI of this

00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:53,700
isn't that great because I don't know

00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:56,249
that I've really gotten the score and

00:29:53,700 --> 00:30:00,059
left I look down so we can then go into

00:29:56,249 --> 00:30:03,210
our click area and say if the click area

00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:04,440
is checked we want to stop the animation

00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:06,269
and this is why before when I was

00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,070
applying those animations I applied them

00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:09,330
to both the click area and the character

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,039
instead of doing the character wrapper

00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:13,769
because we're using this click area and

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,259
it's sibling the div right next to it to

00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:19,830
apply the stopping so with this check we

00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:22,080
want to say animation nun we also want

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,700
to say pointer events nun because that

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,950
means that it's no longer going to be

00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,389
able to be clicked on you can't unclick

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,639
you can't remove your score

00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:32,129
we also are say any character next to

00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:36,480
this is going to get an animation nun

00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:37,889
and we want to maybe add a filter so

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,669
here we can apply like a grayscale

00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:44,549
filter to it and as we play we can

00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:46,769
refresh once I have clicked on this

00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:51,720
eager little person they're hard to

00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:53,940
click sometimes they they should be

00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,580
stopping so let's debug click area

00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:03,119
checks animation done pointer events

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:06,539
none let's see this theoretically should

00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:08,759
be stopping but I'm wondering why it's

00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:11,039
not maybe I'm not clicking on them maybe

00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,799
I am when this happens you have all

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:17,029
these things being saved so believe me

00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:19,859
this usually works I'm going to go to

00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:22,950
another branch I have which is called

00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:24,179
step 12 and then I'm going to hit gulp

00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,460
and it's going to all be magically done

00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,690
for me when i refresh I'm going to click

00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,659
that and it's stopping now

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:33,149
so it looks like the code is the same I

00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:35,489
may have done some kind of strange thing

00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:37,289
I'm going to refresh that I'm going to

00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:41,549
just close out of it and open board as

00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:43,649
CSS but yeah maybe I just wrote this

00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:45,509
wrong anyway as I'm clicking this it's

00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:48,119
stopping the propagation of the event

00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:49,409
this character stops moving we now know

00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,669
that we clicked them as they stopped

00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,510
moving that one which is really hard to

00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:53,550
click we have a

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,080
SCOR we have our game let's add that

00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,360
heart back and then we created since

00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,860
that heart is an after pseudo element we

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,350
can go and then just extend the class

00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:06,600
we've created so we can say add extend

00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:09,180
dot pixelized heart and when we replay

00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,830
the game a little heart animation a

00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,510
little heart will appear once I've

00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:15,360
clicked it so I clicked it the heart is

00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:18,240
there we can even give this a margin top

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,090
of negative 25 pixels so it appears just

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,150
on top of that character and we have

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:27,710
created here in like 35 minutes a CSS

00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:33,480
game live on stage with all of your help

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:36,410
so thank you it's a difficult game

00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:40,400
[Applause]

00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:42,230
[Music]

00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,110
so what I really want you to get from
