Title: CSSconf EU 2017 | Ivana McConnell: CSS and the hierarchy problem: What makes a CSS developer?
Publication date: 2017-05-17
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2017
Description: 
	http://2017.cssconf.eu/speakers/ivana-mc-connell.html

This talk is about hierarchies: as CSS hurtles toward being object- and systems-oriented, the titles and responsibilities of designer and developer become much more fluid and yet, we continue to categorise. We draw lines between front and back end, between CSS and Javascript (“CSS isn’t _real_ development”), and even between CSS disciplines, but why? Furthermore, we implicitly draw these lines between white male developers and everyone else. This results in damaging hierarchies that threaten to devalue the work we do in diversifying CSS — both as a language and as a community.

[Music]

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,469
hello thank you so much for for having

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,430
the year

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:20,460
I'm incredibly intimidated but I will

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,609
try to get through it a little bit about

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,279
me my name is Ivana I work at a company

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,619
called customer i/o we're based in

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,590
Portland but it's a remote company so I

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,590
live in work in Vancouver in Canada I

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,960
was born in Bosnia though raised in

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,610
Croatia lived all over Canada and then

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,370
spent several years in Scotland most

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,860
recently I have a degree in psychology

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,320
and neuroscience but realized too late

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,680
that I didn't want to be an academic and

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,020
right now I'm a UX designer but have

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,190
worked as an interaction designer a

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,199
freelancer and front-end designer and

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,739
I've had the pleasure of CSS being

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:05,100
involved in all of those things so over

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,229
time and across countries I've made lots

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,920
of internet friends and real-life

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:13,650
friends and as a result I've always been

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,369
really into how we build our communities

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,689
on the web both socially and from a code

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,960
perspective as well and how those things

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:26,159
interact so now that you know a little

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,090
bit about me I want to ask you guys what

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,820
do you do um what do you call yourself

00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,520
we don't often describe our roles in one

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,030
word because we know that there's

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,619
usually not one succinct title for them

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,210
we contextualize those job titles with

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,850
the technologies and the languages that

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,610
we work with but have no real common

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,619
language for these things front-end

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,090
engineer for example might mean

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,939
something really different to me than it

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,860
does to you someone saying they're a

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,840
software developer doesn't tell you

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,960
initially a lot about what they built or

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,090
what they used to build it but we

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,210
simplify right we contextualize and

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,979
categorize because that behavior makes

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,239
our lives easier it makes the world

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,120
easier to compute

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:17,110
but this category categorization excuse

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,060
me can harm our communities too because

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,670
how we categorize is based on what we

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,030
value and how we talk about our

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:28,269
profession about CSS that that matters

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:31,269
and that's what I want to talk about so

00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:32,530
to do that we have to go back to to the

00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,560
beginning we have to rewind a little bit

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:38,340
um it did start this way right like CSS

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,560
fit very easily into that kind of design

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,239
appearance bucket there's a clear

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,470
separation between design and

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,910
development you had a web designer and

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,370
now you kind of have designer and

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,130
developer like with visuals being one

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:58,870
thing and code another and you can sort

00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:04,120
of see these lines building but the web

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,530
is growing in so many ways right and you

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,180
know not a day goes by that we don't see

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,730
a piece on medium and I'm pretty sure

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,269
written a few on how designers and

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,489
developers can work together best and

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:17,079
the reason we do that is because the

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,510
lines between them have blurred so much

00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,859
that we don't even know what makes a

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,940
designer and what makes a developer

00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:26,859
because the web isn't just a screen we

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,180
don't build a website we build an

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:33,970
application builds interfaces across

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,160
devices and contexts and interactions

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,430
are more dynamic these experiences are

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:44,519
more immersive and this needs how much

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:47,440
for wider variety of skill sets and I

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,420
think this is awesome right because as

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,389
the industry grows and so do our

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:55,840
capabilities so do our roles and our

00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:58,510
skills we can generalize or even

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,920
specialize we can focus on CSS is a

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,780
whole or just on one small aspect of it

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,329
and this is really cool we talked a lot

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,160
about how we should work together how we

00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:11,200
can make development and design work

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:16,269
together where CSS fits into that and

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:19,030
where we fit into that and yet yeah

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:23,229
we may not see this like outright of

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,910
course or maybe we do I've heard it but

00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,699
the implication is always there it's

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,520
there when we ask what front end means

00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,770
or doesn't mean it's there when we ask

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,520
you know which coding language should I

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:40,500
learn next and it's in job postings it's

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:45,400
in salaries it's in the word development

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:50,289
CSS used to just be designed so what is

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:53,889
it now this is an issue without a

00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:58,389
resolution and that lack of resolution

00:04:53,889 --> 00:05:00,849
has consequences we have so much

00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:03,039
fluidity in our roles and that's okay

00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:05,050
and but we need to produce software at

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,930
the end of the day and the titles that

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:11,860
we hold matter because they impact so

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:14,979
much hiring team construction perception

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,940
pay not to mention the actual experience

00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:20,440
of what it is we're building and so no

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,759
it's not so much about developer and

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,240
designer because we don't build web

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,810
pages now the above simply isn't the

00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,139
case anymore

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:35,139
it's not just fonts and colors and CSS

00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:37,270
is code but not development why we say

00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,860
that language is like HTML and CSS are

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,620
about presentation whereas programming

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,199
is meant to development is meant to

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:49,810
describe function and this was very

00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:52,620
convenient but CSS has grown a lot right

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,449
we have pre-processors that require

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,539
developers level of understanding just

00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:00,340
to implement and use meaningfully like

00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:02,440
like if you looked at some of the docs

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,669
for these things it's like for a

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,259
beginner trying to walk or beginner

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,210
through some of it it's okay I just fire

00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:10,479
up a terminal and install this and all

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:15,009
of these dependencies and no but that's

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:18,300
not development right anyway we have

00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:23,199
transforms right we have complex

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,699
targeted selectors like pseudo elements

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,320
right and if you think about that name

00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:27,980
for a second it kind of blows my mind a

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,750
little bit like pseudo

00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,860
like it doesn't actually fists like

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,480
dynamically populated and with

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,230
methodologies like object-oriented CSS

00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:42,820
CSS layout now and the point of all this

00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:46,010
isn't is to show that it's not just

00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:48,050
presentation and function the code might

00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:51,280
looks really simple and people might say

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,690
oh it's just CSS but interaction and

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,680
presentation effects function and they

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,990
enable function CSS bridges all of that

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,850
it touches everything and expert level

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:06,800
CSS is a key development skill and these

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,270
days like was mentioned in the intro

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,130
people are showing off which you can do

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,100
with CSS and you can say that this is

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:15,500
just design right just aesthetics but

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,760
that that's missing the point the

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,790
implications of being able to do things

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:23,270
like this and just CSS was crazy

00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,710
a while ago whole games can be built in

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,950
it I believe later today we're going to

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,450
learn how to do that and this is an

00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:34,250
example of something that a friend of

00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:36,710
mine created thanks Q it's a CSS

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,720
framework but it's made up of

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,070
self-contained modules and it's

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,800
developed in a way that draws from

00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:44,810
JavaScript and from Ruby dependencies

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,050
are managed important serve specified

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:53,120
and because of its modularity the CSS

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:58,100
can actually be tested and also last

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,600
night at the speaker drink several sort

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,240
of folks who work primarily with

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,380
JavaScript said to me like I don't do

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,760
CSS CSS is hard like Rachel one of my

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,580
fellow speakers said like the most

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,120
complicated stuff I do with CSS but that

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,190
other more quote-unquote developer tasks

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,180
have more legitimacy with attached to

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:22,010
them and even if you you know do

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,090
subscribe to the whole like CSS is just

00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,410
presentation fine as I mentioned

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,390
presentation influences the way that

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,610
people feel about software it enables

00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,620
successful interaction if something

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,330
isn't presented and can be interacted

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,269
with in the right way

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,610
its function is irrelevant there need to

00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:43,779
be people who stand that this or who

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,630
code I suppose at this intersection of

00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:49,010
interaction function and presentation

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,080
and because of how complex the web is

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,050
they deserve their place in development

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,200
and that brings me to the main point

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,269
nice and my talk we're struggling to

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,310
delineate design and development in

00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:04,100
terms of language to give those things

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:06,470
value and find out where we fit while

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,620
struggling with sort of bias and

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,550
archetypes and what happens when these

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,360
definitions of development and CSS are

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,899
unclear unspoken

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,519
and like tied up in these complex

00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:25,190
perceptions of ourselves and our

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,959
competencies so hierarchies are about

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,570
drawing lines they're about identifying

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,130
differences and similarities and then

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,279
and this is the important part of

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:36,829
hierarchies assigning them rankings

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,829
assigning them relative importance this

00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:40,779
lets us categorize and compare things

00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:43,880
relatively speaking

00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,709
things like languages the languages you

00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,279
speak to organized in hierarchies or

00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:50,750
colors evolutionary trees but the kind

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,660
of hierarchies that I'm talking about

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:58,430
here are value based on power and

00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:01,279
authority in a CSS context and in

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,320
general we draw them because we like to

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,959
know that we have a place in society

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,790
within our communities we like to know

00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:10,640
where we stand in relation to our others

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:14,660
were happy when we identify with a group

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,360
like a sports team or fans of a CSS CSS

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,709
framework for example and we're also

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,920
happy when we don't identify with

00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:24,050
another group this is social identity

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,709
theory we define categories and then we

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:31,010
compare and you know right here were

00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:32,360
here because we value CSS and identify

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,860
positively with those who have that

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,940
skill this conference wouldn't exist

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,570
otherwise and on some level these things

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,519
are good

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,170
like I said they help us process the

00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,899
world faster and understand how to

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,190
interact socially it helped us they

00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,310
helped us be less overwhelmed by the

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,370
world

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:53,130
they help employers apply people to the

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,500
right jobs somewhat and when we're in

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,900
those jobs they help us get our work

00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,680
done and if we need help it lets us know

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:03,060
who to go to but they can also be bad

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,240
for the relative importance reasons that

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,850
I mentioned earlier and who defines that

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,790
importance so let's think about why for

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,770
a second

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,780
who defines this like if I ask you to

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,520
put some things in the development there

00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,070
and the other things in not development

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,380
like where would you put them and what

00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,900
about the person next to you or your

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,140
coworker I would venture to say that

00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,190
those things wouldn't all be the same

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,190
and the fact that they wouldn't be is

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,410
something is what I want to address

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:37,680
because if you're hiring someone you

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,480
need to decide how much to pay them how

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,010
do you how do you do that what do you

00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,490
decide first like do you decide the

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:47,160
technology stack of the the job maybe

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,060
the experience but we don't even know

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,560
what that means for a given language

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,300
especially if it hasn't been around that

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,890
long

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:56,970
so we're categorizing and determining

00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:59,700
someone's value before they even exist

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,950
and these hierarchies that we have in

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,510
our minds you know the hiring manager

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,650
the engineers this person that will be

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,589
working with the designers up there

00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:10,310
working with these all differ in subtle

00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:14,520
ways and these ways then compound and

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,900
this impacts who you hire a CSS

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,060
developer for example might be what you

00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,940
need but if you don't identify that as a

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:24,150
valued development thing you won't hire

00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,720
that person and this is something that I

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,570
found interesting

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,850
astac overflows developer surveys they

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:33,540
didn't include CSS as a language like

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,810
anywhere but at least they're open about

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,070
it

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,630
and I think that the only valuable

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,460
hierarchies are clear transparent ones

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,650
and it's this lack of transparency

00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,110
that's the problem we're not drawing

00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:48,330
these hierarchies between skill levels

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:52,050
like manager and junior that's its own

00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:54,900
thing but across languages we're

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:57,930
building tacit value-based hierarchies

00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,020
based on languages that are biased by

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,029
our own investments

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,640
like of course I'm going to value CSS

00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:05,080
higher than amber or whatever because

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,540
I've invested time and money into

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,850
learning it and I love it but I can't

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,640
assume that the person next to me feels

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:18,010
the same or if even that's what my

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:19,899
product needs so what's the point um why

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,910
are we trying to understand trying so

00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:25,360
hard to understand what makes a

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:28,990
developer anyway because we need to were

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,020
compelled to in order to make our world

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,209
easier to understand but also because

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:38,190
these hierarchies affect CSS the

00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:41,170
language the community and the web and

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,000
Tec is changing so fast that we have no

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,550
like agreed-upon standard for what a

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,350
developer is there's no degree or

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,029
certification or whatever and we pride

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,880
ourselves on that like anyone can jump

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:54,670
in and get their start in it I learned

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,180
development on like Neopets for like

00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,500
anyone remembers that but it's a

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,779
double-edged sword because at the same

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,760
time we're trying to make sense of how

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,190
to pay people how to hire us and how to

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,899
actually make software and knowing that

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,610
we haven't figured that out is fine but

00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:14,160
I'd argue that the way we're going about

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:16,750
it this implicit value building based on

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,250
like outdated assumptions about CSS

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:24,100
that's wrong because there's a gravitas

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,720
to the word developer like a technical

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,000
proficiency tied up with credibility

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,700
that for some reason CSS just doesn't

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,850
get and instead of critiquing that

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:37,300
Association like we're worrying about

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,230
where to draw these lines and the

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,149
problem again isn't that these

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,649
hierarchies necessarily exist but that

00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:45,160
they subtle

00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:48,040
there's the differ subtly based on the

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,260
company the person the job post and then

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,600
those reading that information are left

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:56,860
trying to infer these these categories

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,290
these hierarchies and because we're not

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,760
clear we we're not clear on the

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,490
hierarchies we stripped them of their

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,170
effectiveness if we don't come to the

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,170
table with a shared understanding of

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,150
development and how CSS is a part of it

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,190
we can't clearly communicate what we

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,530
value

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,400
and true hierarchies good hierarchies

00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:19,830
are clear they're unambiguous and if not

00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,570
we leave the door open for changing

00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:25,130
interpretations of value and we leave

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,300
the door open for bias and intact this

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,310
automatically skews in favor of a

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,940
certain archetype and I'll talk more

00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,940
about that in a minute

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:38,370
like I mentioned this might be a joke

00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,020
right but its repetition is damaging

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,820
because it becomes implicit it becomes

00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,760
an assumption that we make going in and

00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,860
don't question anymore and to be clear

00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,560
I'm not saying that there isn't a

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:53,040
difference between like CSS HTML

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,240
Javascript and languages like C like I'm

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,000
not saying it's not a difference

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,310
but what's dangerous is the power

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,680
dynamics and subtle implications that

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,870
one is harder and therefore better than

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,400
the other and the creation of archetypes

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:10,620
around them this becomes ingrained it

00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,020
leads us to make bad decisions and treat

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,770
others poorly in some cases even when we

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,850
don't mean to in the same way that

00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,370
characterization makes it easier to

00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:25,260
place people in roles it also makes it

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:27,420
easier to devalue people and saying you

00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,700
know CSS isn't really development or

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,040
some variant of that takes away from

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,470
what I think is a thriving debate around

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:39,210
where CSS is going and what it's capable

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:41,700
of you know for the more we don't talk

00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:43,290
about it if I don't know how your

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,590
hierarchy differs from mine we'll never

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,420
come to any sort of consensus and this

00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:52,590
is implicit but the problems manifest

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:54,570
explicitly and the developer archetype

00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:58,500
and you know what he looks like

00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:01,500
generally is how this implicit weird

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,390
value-based programming language

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:08,189
hierarchy intersects with a biased

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:11,130
social one this this developer male

00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:13,920
usually sits implicitly at the top of

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:17,850
the hierarchy and yes it doesn't write

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:20,429
CSS and illustrate how this intersection

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:22,829
becomes complicated think about how it

00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:24,630
might manifest when sort of a white male

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:27,360
quote unquote CSS developer

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,250
and you know a female perhaps

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,020
quote-unquote CSS developer of color

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,730
applied for the same job

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,850
what hierarchies are applied to those

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,010
people when we don't know or we aren't

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:40,110
transparent about it we reach you know

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:43,380
we reach into our subconscious for

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,559
things we do quote-unquote know and then

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,419
when that knowledge is already wrong

00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:51,210
that of a particular archetype being a

00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,980
developer and good at computer things we

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,909
shoot ourselves in the foot it means

00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:59,880
that we compromise CSS the people who

00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:02,100
use it and develop in it and we

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,230
compromise the industry by leaving out

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,590
people that can actually impact it the

00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,909
most and furthermore if you know we're

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,700
sitting at that hiring table and we

00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:13,770
don't hire any CSS developer at all

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,230
because we don't value CSS as a

00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,900
development skill it impacts the web a

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,820
bit more so just a couple of examples

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,700
here and I think this point it needs

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,650
belaboring because it intersects with

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,970
how CSS perception interacts with the

00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:31,799
social and prevents people who end up

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:33,630
you know lower in these hierarchies

00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:35,309
through no fault of their own from

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,850
participating in our community and

00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:40,770
contributing to CSS development and then

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,880
CSS development contributing to the web

00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:47,340
as a whole and this is complicated

00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:50,460
there's so many hierarchy here and what

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,620
group what we group which fruits we

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:56,100
arbitrarily assigned to sort of high and

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,570
low status but we just kind of accepted

00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,520
this and we've done very little to

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:05,059
change it and beyond beyond that beyond

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,860
archetypes and social intersections um

00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:10,260
whether or not CSS is defined as

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,809
development has impacts on how people

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:16,110
see our skill as technicians and as

00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:18,780
builders of the web for example Jess

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,159
calm you has about twice as many

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,710
attendees as this conference and

00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:25,440
attracts about five times the sponsor

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,919
support and of course a lot goes into

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,780
that that data but it's experience sort

00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,090
of suggests that recruiting and

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,610
conference budgets related CSS are much

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,470
smaller compared to what's spent on

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:41,070
JavaScript so

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:43,559
you know if you develop CSS but don't

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:47,389
know amber or something equivalent or

00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:51,480
are you more skilled or valuable or less

00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:54,750
why and who says are you worth more

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,490
money you're more credibility when we

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,789
perceive people as more skilled we give

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:02,610
those people power and these power

00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:06,090
dynamics are tied up with assumptions of

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:08,490
legitimacy and until now it's been the

00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,080
assumptions of people in power people

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,659
with privilege that govern these

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,330
perceptions like we want to say that

00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:17,789
legitimacy development legitimacy is a

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:21,389
meritocracy but it's not and we know

00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:24,929
it's not there are implicit valid ways

00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:26,399
to be a developer and CSS isn't yet seen

00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:32,100
as one of them and I believe that it

00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:34,259
should be this perception of developer

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,429
legitimacy is really important for

00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:38,100
minority groups for the underrepresented

00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:39,870
as well because these implicit

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,450
structures as I mentioned take power

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,590
away from those who should have it and

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,330
prevent them from contributing to

00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,940
development to the web to the

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:50,820
experiences that we're building on it

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,500
and in the office context perhaps people

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,580
are excluded from meetings or cold

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,259
reviews based on perceived language

00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,539
value and expertise and their inputs

00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:03,750
lost if they were even invited to begin

00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:05,700
with one path into development isn't

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:10,200
better or more deserving than another

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:12,899
and this then leads to arbitrary pay

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,539
scales if I think development is worth a

00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:18,210
lot of money but CSS isn't real

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:21,330
development then stands to reason that

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,549
CSS isn't worth as much money and and

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,200
then if the person doing that CSS

00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:28,139
development is a member of our minority

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,409
group will pay them even less this is

00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:34,830
the problem again and if our attitudes

00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:36,299
and language based hierarchies become

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,820
value-based and vary from person to

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:41,009
person this negatively impacts

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:43,379
individuals communities and the forward

00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:48,419
momentum of languages and CSS especially

00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:49,919
and this has consequences on our mental

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,970
health because you know when you see

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,380
someone as less valuable

00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,080
even in something as simple as which

00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,090
language they choose to code in you will

00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,230
behave differently towards them and just

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,450
because you see it as a joke doesn't

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,059
mean that someone else does for example

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:06,299
a front-end designer who works with CSS

00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:07,890
every day might be as I mentioned

00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,690
excluded from a meeting on a piece of

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,480
critical functionality because they're

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,580
not a developer and this has

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,710
consequences for them personally

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,330
professionally and not to mention for

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:22,020
the product they're building or the

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:23,940
site's they're building so and that

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,220
brings me to you know when these

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,880
applications are built a devaluing of

00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:32,940
CSS in fact sent to when we give this

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,520
value across languages we don't bring

00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,970
all the developers that we need this is

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,960
also from the stack overflow survey you

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,890
can just see these fluctuations in

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,539
popularity and popularity means most

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:49,440
commonly used and there's also yeah

00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:51,419
there's wanted as well so look I'm not

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,770
taking issue with any of this and I'm

00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,960
really happy that Sakura for do stuff

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:57,059
like this um but should the standing of

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,360
a particular language here influence how

00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:03,929
people see our competency probably not

00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:08,730
but for CSS it does so this yesterday on

00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:11,429
my way to on my way here actually yeah

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:14,039
no yes when we as a community devalue

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:15,630
CSS into Deb skill you excellent

00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:18,480
performance suffer and this is true when

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,919
we when we devalue CSS in Deb skill when

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,440
we don't challenge these hierarchies the

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:27,150
web suffers as do its users and as the

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,710
accessible enters into its own sub

00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:33,240
disciplines and specialties you know we

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,400
have to be aware of our own hierarchies

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,500
as well and how that affects our own

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,490
community and how we can best mitigate

00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,429
that so what can we do then I'm not

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,419
suggesting that we get rid of this or

00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:46,830
tried to get rid of this like

00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:48,539
fundamental human behavior because

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,030
hierarchies are fine they make us feel

00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:53,039
safe but they need to be transparent and

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,630
forceful and concrete and not based

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,120
across languages we should feel

00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:59,399
comfortable challenging them there are

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,659
differences between languages but we can

00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:02,520
identify and understand those

00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:05,780
differences and usually use them to

00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:10,470
bridge skill gaps and solve problems

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:11,880
so if something is implicit right we

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,770
can't fight it if we don't know we

00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,950
disagree or we're afraid to admit it we

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:19,320
can't make things any better so

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:21,600
individually organizationally we can ask

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,000
ourselves what our hierarchies are we

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,429
can write we can write down or somehow

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,380
record what we perceive to be a

00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:31,520
developer and don't just ask the

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,960
question answer it and answer it openly

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,429
if we're scared of people having more

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,570
information it's a good sign that we're

00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:42,000
doing something wrong we can be hyper

00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,350
aware of our own biases and hierarchies

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,659
and be honest with each other

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,520
check assumptions not just at the door

00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:51,030
but throughout and call each other on

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,289
them write them down before we talk for

00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,390
example in a hiring meeting what's

00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:57,450
important to everybody in the room don't

00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:59,490
we shouldn't assume that we know and if

00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,780
the hierarchies are so obvious if CSS

00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,270
isn't really development then it should

00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:06,200
be easy to state them saying them out

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:08,520
loud makes them real it bring it

00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,559
surfaces those assumptions that are

00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,990
empowering legitimacy and it takes them

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:17,700
away too it makes us accountable to our

00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:20,039
definitions and we can't expect people

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,590
who are the victims of these hierarchies

00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:25,919
to drive the change so those who of

00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:28,710
hiring power can get across so as the

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,960
skill that those would hire in Paris

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,360
who's we can get across to people that

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,159
we value the skill that they bring not

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,669
the language of that skill manifest in

00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:41,970
if we can if we can shout about CSS as

00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:43,409
development we can and we should focus

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,350
on the skill sets that people are

00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:48,270
bringing to us and start you know

00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:51,559
getting a handle on those complex sensor

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:53,640
intersections that I mentioned and

00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:57,720
challenging hierarchies in a broad

00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,100
context means putting on early groups

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,750
and decision making roles and

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,539
challenging hierarchies by deviating

00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:06,090
from them in a CSS context understanding

00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,830
that CSS is technical is development

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,990
governs function and not just

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,780
presentation and it should be valued

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:14,580
like the complex skill set that it is if

00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,429
it was and even if it wasn't real

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,350
development before it is now so let's

00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:23,310
talk about that let's change

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:26,040
and know this isn't easy this is quite I

00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,900
know he said that I would tell you tell

00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,020
you what you know seasons development

00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:33,330
and how to fix this but I I know that we

00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,240
need to categorize we all know this and

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:40,080
I'm not asking you not to what I am

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,570
proposing here is this conversation that

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,210
those of us who think these hierarchies

00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:47,730
are so obvious actually take a good look

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,590
at them document them and make them open

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,920
you know no shouting about right or

00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:54,210
wrong or anything just openness and only

00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,570
then once we have that transparency

00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,430
around whether whether and who believed

00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,900
CSS is development can we drive

00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,940
meaningful change in one direction or

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,560
another

00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:08,820
yeah so it's not easy but so what right

00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,940
it's fine to be uncomfortable with

00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:16,590
disagreement what's not fine is allowing

00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:19,260
these mr. Bester because we're avoiding

00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:21,360
having our opinions challenged we don't

00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,370
have to agree but we have to come to

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,100
some sort of shared understanding like

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:27,990
why is it okay to use disagreement for

00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,540
example in in the startup world in the

00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,730
tech world to improve CSS or any other

00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,260
language for that matter as cold but not

00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:37,650
to improve the environment to the people

00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,810
who write it in that language in these

00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,250
interpersonal situations is hard to

00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:43,920
admit perhaps that we've hurt someone

00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,990
else or hurt an application to the thing

00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,370
that we were building in some way

00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:49,020
especially if we're asking with good

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,770
intentions but it's okay to make a

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,750
mistake right and

00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:57,230
I don't think this is optional we pride

00:27:54,750 --> 00:28:00,030
ourselves on solving hard problems and

00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:02,400
can solve this we can drive CSS forward

00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,750
as development and make what we're

00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,260
building better and make our community

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:10,260
better we could put our money where our

00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:13,680
mouths are and learn from failure like

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:15,990
we say we do all the time and if we said

00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,600
CSS isn't real development in the in the

00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,700
past it's fine we can always change the

00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,280
hierarchies and better understand the

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,550
relationships of CSS to the rest of the

00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,180
web and for us like CSS is just it's

00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,330
just a start

00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:33,660
it is development and let's make that

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,270
forgiving we can if we do that or if we

00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:39,510
sort of set on the path to doing that we

00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:41,550
could better understand our roles we can

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,080
actually leverage hierarchies the way

00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,180
we're supposed to do right better

00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,440
understand our roles as CSS engineers

00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:53,910
developers designers whatever when we

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:56,130
better know what we value and how we can

00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,860
know where to spend all of our energies

00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,990
and how to put together better teams how

00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:04,560
to make better products and better web

00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,440
experiences and most importantly we can

00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,720
make sure that our community is as

00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:13,590
brilliant as we know it can be both

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,620
technically and otherwise thank you very

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,910
much for having me I appreciate it all

00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:21,690
right

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:25,190
