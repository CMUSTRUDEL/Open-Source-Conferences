Title: CSSconf EU 2017 | Rachel Andrew: Where does CSS come from?

Understanding how CSS is developed is more than an academic exercise. It gives you a way of understanding why things are weird, which is a good starting point to avoiding or fixing weirdness. It can give you an early heads up as to what might be happening in the very near future. It also opens up an opportunity to be part of the process, to contribute to CSS - just like any open source project. Then once we have new CSS on the horizon, we can all be part of encouraging browser vendors to ship it!

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:16,080
say yes that's me Rachel Andrew this is

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,210
my second time at CSS comps EU I've done

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,699
a few CSS comps around around the world

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,100
now really great to be here Berlin is

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,500
very much my favorite city so I take any

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,180
chance to come here so I'm going to talk

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,730
it's a non technical talk which is

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,180
unusual for me my sort of comfort zone

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,770
is to have 150 slides of code so I've

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,590
had to write a non-technical talk I'm

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,020
going to talk about where CFS comes from

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:45,000
and if we wanted to be literal about

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:47,820
this it comes from 1996 because that's

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,789
when the CSS 1 specification was

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,980
published and in the same year

00:00:50,789 --> 00:01:00,350
we got ie 3 and that was the first

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:04,199
browser which had some CSS support and

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:08,970
very neatly my career as a web developer

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,280
started in 1996 I am one of those people

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,369
who had to install her web browsers from

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,600
CDs that were sent by the ISP so if

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,820
anybody else could remember doing that

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,799
anyone else anyone I was old was a few

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,920
of you we can all get together remember

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,240
the good old days later so I've been

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,720
working on the web for a long time and

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,110
so my history as a web developer sort of

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,329
has gone along with CSS I started to

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,009
build websites without CSS because it

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,790
wasn't a reality that I had version 2

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,340
browsers

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,110
there was no option other than font tags

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,280
and nested tables that was just how

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,680
things were done and the really amazing

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,420
thing about CSS other that we talked

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,549
about this enough is the fact that all

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,829
of those early things we built and as we

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,500
started to use CSS as we started to use

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,700
CSS for layout all that stuff really

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,610
still works

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,549
CSS remains backwards compatible and

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,140
that's really important and therein lies

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,299
a lot of the problems that we actually

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,330
have with CSS in terms of creating CSS

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:12,040
and using CSS is this you know we can't

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,939
go around breaking the web

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,700
so I'm not really going to talk about

00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:19,549
the history of CSS today that's just

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,920
pretty well-documented what I really

00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:25,969
want to talk about is where does CSS

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,549
come from today where does new CSS come

00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:30,859
from what's the process how do we go

00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:34,250
from an idea to something that ends up

00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:36,890
in a browser because I hear all kinds of

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,900
strange theories and kind of like weird

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,000
conspiracy theories about where CSS

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,040
comes from and I think some of that

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,959
actually does have its roots back in in

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,069
the olden days back in the days when I

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,220
became a member of the web standards

00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:51,439
project because browser vendors were

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,840
competing at one point on platform

00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,849
features so they were bringing out new

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,040
CSS features and saying well we've got

00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,989
this I we've got this and Netscape

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,639
hasn't got it and ultimately we were

00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:04,040
building if you wanted to do cool new

00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,840
stuff you'd build two websites you'd

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,060
build one for Internet Explorer one for

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,620
Netscape you detect which browser the

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,579
user hadn't you'd send them to the right

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,989
website and this was terrible and people

00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:16,970
didn't want to do that would put best

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:19,699
viewed with buttons on their web pages

00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,099
that's horrible and people kind of

00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:25,220
expect that browser vendors are locked

00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:27,470
in some battle about CSS and actually

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,319
what really happens looks a bit like

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,090
this this certificate the CSS working

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,549
group meeting in Tokyo a couple of weeks

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,319
ago we were all locked in that room no

00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:38,180
one was allowed to go for coffee and so

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,889
we decided what happens to line-height

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,949
when you've got two founds of different

00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:44,750
character sets next to each other

00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:46,489
now just in that photo there are people

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,440
from Microsoft Google Mozilla and

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,109
several other companies and they're all

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:55,010
working together on a particular CSS

00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:57,169
issue and you can have a look at the

00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,400
current members of the CSS working group

00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:02,540
it's a whole bunch of people making CSS

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,819
representing lots of different browser

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,409
vendors and other people there's lots of

00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:09,470
people there who work who work on things

00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:11,840
like ebooks epub and outputting CSS to

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,810
print so you can have a look at their

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,269
affiliations the people who are there so

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,029
any CSS specification passes through

00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:22,099
this group we get the opportunity to

00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,580
debate parts of the spec and vote on

00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:27,099
changing or adding features and that we

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,199
stops one vendor a one-party dragging a

00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:33,669
specification away from what would

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,379
benefit the web as a whole and the specs

00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:37,629
have to start somewhere so they come

00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:39,490
from all sorts of places they often do

00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:41,830
come from a particular browser vendor in

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,569
order to solve problems that that vendor

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,180
thinks are important they may be kind of

00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:48,430
problems they see in their business but

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,449
it's not just browser vendors the CSS

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,949
shapes spec started life with Adobe and

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,150
others come directly from the working

00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,879
group because they're going to solve

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,740
some problem that we see or we know we

00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,690
need a way to do a certain type of thing

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,159
to enable something else and so those

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,590
specs might come directly from the

00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:10,419
working group so I wanted to take a look

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,539
at this process and I thought I'd do

00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:15,099
that via CSS grids because if you know

00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:17,259
me you'll know that I'm a bit of a grid

00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:19,300
superfan and I've been working with the

00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,590
spec for quite a long time and so I kind

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,650
of know the history of this

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,740
specification so let's talk about CSS

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,389
specs via grid and what happened to that

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,870
and how it became something that we

00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:36,400
could use in browsers so how did that

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:39,449
start out quite a long time ago it's

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,740
2011 we got a first public working draft

00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:44,020
now if you go and have a look at that

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,120
document you'll find that a lot of the

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,190
concepts there seem pretty familiar if

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,479
you've used modern grid layout so north

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,060
a lot of the features that you use a

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,680
kind of outlined in that spec there

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,509
might have different names or look a bit

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,460
different and things are a little bit

00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:59,680
vague around the edges but it's kind of

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,569
all there so it's six years before it

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,009
made into our browsers we have this

00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:09,879
first draft and in fact it goes back a

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:12,669
long way the ideas in grid go back to

00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:16,000
around 2005 this is the CSS advanced

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:17,860
layout module it looks very like some of

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,199
the stuff that's in the grid spec the

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,229
grid template areas ASCII art syntax

00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,539
pretty much describes in this spec and

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:27,340
that's often the case of working group

00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:30,400
things you get these notes these

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:32,379
collections of ideas that may well

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,210
become something that we have in CSS but

00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,740
might just kind of float around just

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,630
like when you're developing any products

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,689
you kind of have these ideas and you

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,889
think oh yeah that would be

00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,659
cool maybe we should think about

00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,399
implementing that and it gets kind of

00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:49,309
put on the back burner that happens in

00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:52,129
CSS as well so a working draft now a

00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:54,409
working draft is essentially a snapshot

00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,419
of the state of the spec at a particular

00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:58,219
date and it means we can reference it it

00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:00,049
means I can write about it and say oh

00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:02,779
you know on this date this working draft

00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:05,179
this is the names of the properties it's

00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:06,019
useful to have a reference of the state

00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:07,759
of respect

00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:09,439
now publication of a working draft

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,689
doesn't mean a lot in terms of

00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,489
implementation it doesn't mean the specs

00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:15,769
mature it might not be finished it might

00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:18,679
have great big holes in it it's just the

00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:21,469
snapshot of where the work was on that

00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:24,319
day if you want to see where the work

00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:25,969
actually is today you want to look for

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,009
the editors drafts and they're always

00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:30,139
linked from the working draft now that's

00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,819
what the spec editors are actually

00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,889
working on right now so that would be

00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,300
the most up-to-date thing but could be

00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,860
completely different to the working

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,079
draft and any experimental

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:43,639
implementations it's you know where all

00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:45,110
the bug fixes are going and if you take

00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,379
a look at that first public working

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:51,110
draft you'll see the editors listed and

00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:53,809
those spec editors were from Microsoft

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,669
so the initial grid spec came from

00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:58,429
Microsoft you have them plank for the

00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:00,199
fact we have grid at all in addition to

00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:02,050
drafting this first version of the spec

00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,249
they created an experiment

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,300
implementation in ie10

00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:10,039
so grid is in ie10 and up its ms prefix

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,209
because that's how experiments were

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:16,459
released in those days so in general as

00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:18,199
specs are developed if they've come from

00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:20,749
a browser event there's going to be some

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,459
experimental implementation that they've

00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:24,079
done back in the day it was a vendor

00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:26,899
prefixes now they tend to be behind

00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,959
flags and these give you the chance to

00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:31,789
play around with new CSS which is really

00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,059
important and I'll come back to that in

00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:36,800
a bit so the experimental invitations

00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,329
let the vendors the browser vendor and

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,529
also the working group know whether this

00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:41,839
is something that people are interested

00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:44,930
in and to start to look at the problems

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,670
that might be in that spec and it was

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:50,170
where my journey with gridlayout began

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:54,310
with this experimental ie implementation

00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:56,560
I tend implemented quite a lot of the

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,210
features in the spec not everything but

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,000
it was enough to make me realize that

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:04,090
this was something that we wanted and

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,760
what I also knew through having followed

00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:09,400
CFS for such a long time was that new

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,920
stuff often needs someone to promote it

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,240
it needs superfans it needs someone to

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,590
go out there and talk to other web

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,020
developers and say look at this cool

00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,690
thing because it through that that

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,370
interest is gauged and that we can have

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,750
actually get this stuff into all of our

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,910
browsers so I thought well I'm going to

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,830
start talking about this I want to start

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,530
telling people about this spec and use

00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,420
what I knew about teaching CSS so I've

00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:34,420
been teaching basic CSS and it's about

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,280
2001 sort of take what I knew about that

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,320
and apply it to this thing that was

00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,460
experimental and start talking about it

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,860
and while I was doing this the spec

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,690
moved on and for quite a while I was

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,860
talking I was standing on stage talking

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,810
about something which didn't have a

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,030
browser implementation because the spec

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,340
was different to what was in i8n but we

00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,950
didn't have any news any new

00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,360
implementations thankfully that didn't

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,190
last too long because it was kind of

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,800
hard making up how this stuff might work

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:05,710
and we started to get an implementation

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,110
in blink and WebKit which is done by a

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,690
company called agalya and actually

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,990
sponsored by Bloomberg and here's a

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:16,180
little bit of CSS history because the

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,430
first time I met the people from a Galia

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,980
doing that implementation and also some

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:23,710
from Bloomberg was here at CSS comps in

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,780
2014 where I was talking about CSS grid

00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,430
layout and I was actually pretty nervous

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,990
once I realized they were all here

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,790
because I was going to be talking about

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,740
the work that they were doing and they

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,300
were going to be in the room so that was

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,070
very scary but it was very night it was

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,260
great to meet them and we we sort of

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,880
chat back and saw us on Twitter now and

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:44,400
things and I've been in touch than ever

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:47,320
since I think it's also interesting that

00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:51,490
Bloomberg sponsored the development of

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,350
CSS grid in blink and WebKit so they

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,850
wanted the feature they wanted it for

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,070
the embedded chromium that's inside

00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,170
their terminal product so they wanted

00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,720
that platform feature and by sponsoring

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,520
it as an open web feature we all get it

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,940
and they get what they need for their

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,710
business

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,120
that's very interesting and Bloomberg

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,940
about responded quite a lot of features

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,290
and CSS and JavaScript to be implemented

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:17,140
into browsers so by this point we had

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:20,110
some implementations and we were

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,240
starting to work with those and I was

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,740
presenting about grid and talking to web

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,620
developers that you know people like at

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:32,380
CSS conf and something came up over and

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:35,230
over again and it was this there was no

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,080
way to create a gap between tracks in

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,430
the grid and people immediately looked

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,500
at grid and said well it's a bit like

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,670
mode two column layout why don't we have

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,890
something like column gap in grid now in

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,390
the IE implementation it was kind of a

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,280
bit annoying but it didn't really matter

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,410
too much he didn't have gutters what you

00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,330
could do is define little skinny tracks

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,620
in your grid and use those as gutters

00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,260
because you had to place everything

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,480
explicitly on the grid but the new

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,760
specification had this idea of also

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,190
placement so you could define a grid and

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,530
then throw a bunch of content asset and

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,510
grid will just Auto place it's a bit

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,870
like with Flex box where things you know

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,810
place one after the other with no

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,940
gutters you couldn't use auto placement

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:21,580
because grid would try and place items

00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:25,330
into those skinny tracks so that was an

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:27,310
idea so I was talking about this on

00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,870
stage and saying you know this isn't

00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,430
great web developers are talking about

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,000
this and saying we need to have some

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,740
kind of gap between our tracks which led

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,750
me to discussing the issue with their

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,400
people from the working group and one of

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,410
the spec offers she wrote the feature

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,810
into the spec where it was implemented

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,730
and became part of the level 1 spec

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:49,270
which means that a bit of code like this

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,670
with those 10 pixel gutter tracks could

00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:55,480
be simplified and would end up looking

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,830
like this and the thing about this is I

00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,750
mean that was just one thing that kind

00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:01,720
of went into the spec that I you know

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,430
remember and I was kind of part of but

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,590
the important thing about that is that

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,280
that was feedback from the web community

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,420
making its way into a CSS specification

00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,580
because we were playing with an

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,380
experimental spec we were able to make

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,540
changes to that spec and

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,850
time I wasn't a working boot member I've

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,280
only been a working group member and for

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,780
for about a year so what are the working

00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,340
group member and I was just talking to

00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,480
other web developers but we were able to

00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:30,730
make a change the level one spec we can

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:37,570
do this with any new bit to the platform

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:39,310
that were interested in so we've got a

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,260
spec that's kind of in this state and

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,760
it's changing and it's becoming

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,530
different as it's moving along and

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,990
browsers are implementing at the same

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,460
time so we've kind of got a spec and

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,780
we've got browser development and things

00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,460
are changing in the spec and the

00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,500
browsers are having to make changes

00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,000
because of that and that's kind of how a

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,760
lot of things happen in this kind of

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,410
circular way where we get an

00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,420
implementation and we get the specs

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,040
developing alongside each other it's

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,200
certainly not a case that the working

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,150
group sort of hide in a room and develop

00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,620
a specification throw it at browser

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,280
vendors and say well they go you know

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:16,900
good luck with that

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:18,220
this thing happens in a circular way and

00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,460
this iterative development has happened

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,820
for a very long time with specifications

00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:27,280
but as many people know this is bit

00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,800
nerves in the past if you try to use

00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,780
early flexbox for example in a

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,160
production site it was vendor prefixed

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:36,580
you could use it in a production site

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,160
and you might have a site working and

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,620
then a new browser came out with a

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,880
different implementation of flexbox at

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,650
one point there were kind of three

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,920
different implementations of flexbox out

00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:50,110
there in the wild now grid has changed

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,540
even more than the flexbox spec did but

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,950
it did so behind a feature flag in

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,050
browsers which meant that no one could

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,700
use it for production code so we didn't

00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,770
have this issue if it kind of been out

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,830
there and biting people as the spec

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:04,480
changed it so that's really the

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,770
difference between developing with

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,730
vendor prefixes which has really gone

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:12,100
away and developing with feature flags

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,630
it's enabled respect to change and to

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,210
have this issue ative process of browser

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:18,730
development and spec development without

00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:21,690
that then sort of getting into our sites

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,690
and causing us problems

00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,350
so it took till 2016 for the SPECT for

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,720
the working group to essentially say we

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:34,410
think this is probably done that's quite

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,490
a long time it's a very very big spec

00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,800
when the working group thinks something

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:43,329
is pretty much done how its voted to

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,129
become a candidate recommendation and

00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:47,860
what that means is the spec has moved on

00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:49,420
from being a working draft and the way

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,910
think of things this is time it needs to

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,800
have implementation experience we think

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,180
this spec can be implemented we think

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,579
it's useful we think it does the things

00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,199
it's set out to do you know do we have

00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:01,600
implementation experience

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,540
so how vendors implemented everything

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,040
and the next step will be a proposed

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,300
recommendation so this is like saying

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,420
well this is what we think is going to

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,089
be the spec and we need to have two

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,939
independent interoperable implementation

00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:18,040
of all of the features so that means

00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:19,839
that we need to have two browsers really

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,980
that have implemented the features and

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,019
not only do you need to have two

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,240
browsers the work needs to have been

00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:29,019
done by two different people or groups

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,420
of people so the work done by a Galia

00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:32,589
say in web WebKit and blink that

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,819
wouldn't really count as two

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,589
implementations they're different

00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:37,569
browsers actually pretty much the same

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,550
code because I think Graham was broken

00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:41,410
on that before the the projects Forks

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,300
but it's the same company doing that

00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,930
work but we've also got the work in

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,550
Firefox

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,439
so because you've got the work in

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,579
Firefox done by a different team we've

00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:52,930
got two implementations and so hopefully

00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,160
grid will be able to progress you know

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,170
once all the little pubs have been

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,259
worked out and all of the features are

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,300
implemented gradually as progress on and

00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:03,250
the reason we have this requirements

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,980
that make sure that we don't have things

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,020
that are you know WC recommendations

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,880
with only implemented in one browser or

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,350
perhaps could only be implemented in one

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:17,020
browser because of the way that browser

00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:18,909
works something you might see in the

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,860
spec if you in fact you look at the

00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:23,380
current working draft you'll see that

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:27,399
something called sub-grid is marked as

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,110
at-risk in the spec and what this means

00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:30,760
actually in the current editors draft

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,240
subgrid has been removed it's been

00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,740
pushed to level 2 and this at-risk flag

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,150
what it means really is this is a

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,490
feature that we think

00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,760
might not be able to be implemented by

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,410
two implementations it might not be in a

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,690
state that we can actually get that and

00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:49,570
move the speck on in a timely manner so

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,220
we flag it is at risk that doesn't mean

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,470
that the thing will never be implemented

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,910
and in fact sub-grid was discussed at

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,680
the last working group meeting we had a

00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,690
breakout session on it it's still very

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,270
much on the cards but it's been moved

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,130
into level 2 of the spec rather than

00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,560
dropped so it essentially moved into a

00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,810
different release of that bit of CFS I

00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,910
just like you might decide that a

00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,560
certain feature of your product is going

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,850
to get bumped into another release so

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,190
that you can ship the stuff you've been

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:21,550
working on your CSS works pretty much in

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:24,490
the same way so March 2017 we got grid

00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:26,920
in all of these browsers and edge of

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,640
also announced that they're going to be

00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:33,280
updating too so it took a very long time

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,910
it took almost six years to get grid

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,460
into browsers so wide earth to CSS take

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:42,910
so long it's partly because there's a

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:45,460
lot of stakeholders it needs to be

00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,600
implemented in browsers in a way that's

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,010
not going to cause problems or

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,370
performance problems accessibility

00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:53,080
issues and behind every browser is a

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,300
business and they're going to have

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,800
different priorities they need to be

00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,200
able to schedule a team to work on

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,870
something to get that implementation in

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,400
the browser so we got grid because

00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,230
Microsoft thought it was interesting to

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,120
start with and then Bloomberg we're

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:12,310
willing to fund it into other browsers

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,850
there's also us authors the people who

00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:18,460
write CSS CSS has to make as much sense

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:20,200
as possible to web developers because if

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,700
something is just too complicated or

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,440
crazy-looking what people might not

00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,000
implement it they might not use it and

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:30,550
then there's no point having that CSS

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,500
tool introducing this talk I mentioned

00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,810
how amazing it was that CSS doesn't

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,140
break things it's backwards compatible

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:39,730
this is really really important and it

00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,130
will come as no surprise to people in

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,650
this room that some of CSS is a bit

00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,300
suboptimal

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:49,540
so behold the list of things that we're

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,840
going to fix in CSS just as soon as

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:56,090
someone has invented a time

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:58,760
machine so if it seems that some CSS is

00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:01,760
really really weird at doing a bit of

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,310
digging might just turn up why it's so

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,080
weird which at least will confirm that

00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,150
the CSS working group aren't just trying

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,740
to make your life hard but also if I

00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,770
understanding why things seem really

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,540
weird it can help you understand and

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,250
remember that you know it may be because

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,510
it was added a long time ago we didn't

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,700
know the web was going to be like this

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,320
and it may be because they're new but

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,670
they have to cope with something added a

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,890
long time ago when we didn't know the

00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,270
web was going to be like this and

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,650
sometimes they're weird because they're

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,330
dealing with stuff that you don't run

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,430
into there's some stuff that's weird

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,630
because it has to cope with languages

00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,100
that were in right-to-left on top to

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,840
bottom as well as left-to-right there's

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,090
lots and lots of stuff in CSS which is

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,610
dealing with that kind of issue so

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:46,940
trying to figure out why things seem odd

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:50,090
can just help you remember them but what

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,850
is really important is that you can help

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,830
to influence the direction of CSS far

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,590
more than you imagine that you can and

00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:59,270
you can do this in a whole bunch of ways

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,310
that I'm going to cover it now because I

00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,690
really as someone who is just a web

00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,070
developer you know running a tiny

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,650
company I'm not from a big browser

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,780
vendor and I'm on the working group and

00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,430
the thing that I like to do is take

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,350
people's feedback to the working group

00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,180
take other web developers feedback and

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:18,320
bring it to the working group so here's

00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:20,150
way everyone can be doing that one of

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,370
the simplest ways to get involved is to

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,650
go to browsers and ask for features to

00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:27,080
be implemented a lot of browsers have

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,450
got official ways of doing this go and

00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:33,590
use it both the stuff post stuff up tell

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:35,870
browsers that you want stuff but even

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,330
more important is to start using things

00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:41,360
especially if that stuff only exists in

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:44,210
one browser at the moment browser

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,280
vendors are tracking usage of features

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,800
to see what the demand is for the

00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,380
feature so here you can see the usage of

00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,270
flex this is on Chrome status they're

00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,210
tracking see how often this stuff is

00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:58,610
used Microsoft has got a similar data

00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,960
gathering effort if you use a feature in

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,090
production even if it's just on your

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,140
personal site and even if you have to do

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,510
a fallback for other browsers that

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,010
is noted and it's like oh well people

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,790
are wanting this because they're using

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:13,800
it for things that are tucked away

00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,170
behind browser flag using them in

00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,570
production is impossible but another way

00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,910
to show interest is if you write or talk

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:23,330
about this stuff write posts on your

00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:25,320
blogs you talk about the thing do

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:28,440
presentations at meetups or whatever

00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,060
this photo is a screenshot from event

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,410
part in Seattle which is when edge

00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,200
announced they were going to update

00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:37,230
their grid implementation they responded

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,600
on stage to an email I sent them in 2014

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:42,570
chasing them up about updating that ie

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,210
10 implementation browser vendors are

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:51,030
listening they want to know what we want

00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:53,790
make sure that they get that message and

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:56,040
it's not just about speaking to browser

00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:59,880
vendors you can actually take part in

00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,920
developing CSS itself here you don't

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,630
need to be a special person you don't

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,060
need to be an advice expert the CSS

00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,890
working group to get involved as we need

00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:10,140
designers and developers to take a look

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:14,480
at new stuff to make suggestions about

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,480
things that we haven't solved yet in CSS

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,860
everything that happens at the CSS

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,510
working group happens in the open so you

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,400
can follow along with what's happening

00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:26,460
and you can you know make your own

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,530
comments these specifications and issues

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,300
raised against them are held in github

00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:32,370
in the Citiz working group drafts

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,840
repositories you can go and you can have

00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,160
a look at that and you can see what

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,540
issues have already been raised you can

00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,180
comment on them you can raise some of

00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,620
your own there the series written people

00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,300
on Twitter and things are posted there

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,250
that we're working on and also sometimes

00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,290
direct questions are posted there quite

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,330
often about naming what should we call

00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:51,390
this property because we don't know and

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:53,370
we're asking for feedback you can also

00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,630
see all of the current work of the CSS

00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,980
working group so you can see if there's

00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:03,480
something that you think you'd like to

00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:05,130
comment on feature request to CSS you

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,080
can request those in very much the same

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:09,720
way you'd ask for any feature of a

00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,550
product and the best way to do that is

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,010
to come up with us or the use case as

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,720
opposed to proposing syntax actually the

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,130
syntax or sense is very very hard to

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,460
kind of work out because it has to cope

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,039
with all

00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,600
old stuff and legacy stuff and quite

00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,490
often we go round and round on names

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,220
quite a few times before it's decided

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:28,620
what it's going to be but the use case

00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,480
is the important thing now what problem

00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,419
are you trying to solve with this CSS

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,190
and our authors already working around

00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,770
this in some way a lot of the time

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,909
people are doing things in JavaScript

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,039
that would make a lot of sense to be

00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:43,710
able to do in CSS what if we've got that

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,659
JavaScript implementation then that's a

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,549
really good test case for well hey know

00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:50,340
how do we actually do this in native CSS

00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:51,899
so that's really useful and if using you

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,570
know using javascript to do things isn't

00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:56,220
a bad thing and but are there problems

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,570
because of that use of JavaScript you

00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,250
know is it creating a performance issue

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:02,010
that perhaps we could solve that it was

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,929
part of CSS so that sort of stuff if you

00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,610
can bring that into an issue on github

00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:07,350
if people are going to look at that and

00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,970
then they talk about it you know we

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,980
bring up these things in working group

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,120
meetings and talk about them and try and

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:17,309
see if there is a way that they could be

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:19,080
solved so as an example you can go and

00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:21,029
have a look at one of the things that

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,399
happens people start to look at CSS grid

00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:26,309
and they say oh you know can I just

00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:28,230
style the backgrounds of grid areas can

00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:29,640
i style column tracks can i add borders

00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,049
to them and the answer the moment is no

00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,789
you have to put an element in there to

00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:35,039
style them and it's kind of creating

00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:37,440
containers for elements so we need some

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,419
kind of grid cell pseudo element in

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,399
order that you can style the backgrounds

00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,899
and borders absolutely a lot of people

00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:44,970
have asked for so it's something that

00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:45,960
has been put in as an issue and quite a

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,850
lot of people have commented on that

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,080
thread this thing you're interested in

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,450
you can always go and read and see if

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,940
you've got anything else to share so

00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,250
this is how new CSS is happening if

00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,539
people are asking for things and we're

00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,909
talking about them and trying to work

00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:01,230
out the best way of doing that so that

00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:03,299
would probably that'd be a level two

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,000
feature now you can see it's got a CSS

00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:08,010
grid to a flight tag on it so that we

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,169
can sort of keep track on it as we start

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:14,309
to look at the level to a CSS grid

00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:15,929
layout now it's not just about new

00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:18,809
features there are bugs in

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:20,100
specifications and you know the CSS

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:21,480
effects so it can be very long and

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,070
complex and they can end up with bugs

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,470
then if you spot something that's an

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,820
issue come and raise it if it turns out

00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,340
it's not an issue it might just be that

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,990
we need to clarify that bit of respect

00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,730
there because someone thinks that what's

00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,110
said in the spec is actually wrong so

00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,909
that's actually a bug as well to what

00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:41,909
the specs to be clear so common log

00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:43,200
issues against respects and web browsers

00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:45,779
they'll be very happy to hear about your

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,909
interrupts issues too you can go and you

00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:49,409
can log bugs and any browser if you find

00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:51,570
saying that it's not working in a

00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:54,029
browser go and tell them about it

00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,950
because quite often it's when people get

00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,600
their hands on new CSS they start using

00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,340
it with some other CSS they start using

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,779
it with some JavaScript or in

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,490
conjunction with a framework and that

00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:04,649
shows that bugs that no one spotted

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,980
before if you find them go and log them

00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:10,769
that helps everybody and you learn this

00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,259
great thing when you log bugs you learn

00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:15,690
how to make reduce test cases which I

00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:17,279
believe is a web development superpower

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,529
and not enough people are good enough at

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,869
doing this it makes your life a lot

00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:23,879
easier if you learn how to make a reduce

00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:26,129
test case not just for logging bugs but

00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:28,499
also fixing problems in your own work

00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:30,450
getting good at stripping down problems

00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:32,610
the simplest case really makes

00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:36,080
everything that you do an awful lot

00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:40,940
easier and it will help other people to

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,940
reproduce your bug and to fix it quickly

00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:48,690
the thing is what I found is that

00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:51,899
contributing to CSS has been an amazing

00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,029
way to learn about CSS what I've learned

00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:56,159
in the last few years following the grid

00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:59,009
spec and ultimately becoming part of the

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,749
CSS working group has been absolutely

00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:02,759
amazing and I've been doing this for

00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:06,869
twenty years and I feel like I have

00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:08,340
learned so much yeah I contribute to CSS

00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:11,309
I spend a lot of time doing free work

00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,889
essentially for the web platform but I

00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:15,869
think we're pretty much even because it

00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:18,240
gives me so much back in terms of what

00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:19,559
I've learned as I've done that you know

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,179
what I've learned by raising an issue

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:23,039
and then having all of the implications

00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,749
of that explained to me you know I

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,210
couldn't have got that anywhere else so

00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:31,009
I've learned so much by contribution to

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:33,360
CSS it's been very very much worth it

00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:35,789
and so really to answer that question

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,119
aware does CSS come from where does

00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:41,009
modern CSS come from there's absolutely

00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,290
no reason why the next amazing feature

00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:47,700
can't come from any one of the people

00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:51,630
sat in this room today in very real ways

00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:53,930
CSS comes from people like you and me so

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:56,340
be part of it because it is great fun

00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:58,710
thank you very much for listening you'll

there and you can find me all over the

00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,470
