Title: CSSconf EU 2017 | Patricia Realini: CSS Art History 101: Decoding Layout Through The Ages
Publication date: 2017-06-06
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2017
Description: 
	http://2017.cssconf.eu/speakers/patricia-realini.html

For centuries the visual arts have been used to tell stories, warn people about dangers and invoke emotion. Today we use the internet for all those purposes and more. Just as the Vatican employed painters to spread their message – it will be the developers and designers who will lead us into the next Renaissance. But there is still a lot to learn from the great masters. In this talk, we will flexbox the Golden Ratio with Leonardo DaVinci, up the pixel ratio for our devices with the Impressionists & ”inspect elements” of some iconic works of art to make the web a more beautiful place.

[Music]

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:21,350
thanks Jessica I so um guess this is the

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,150
last round of talks at CSS calm so sad

00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:28,170
let's get the party started so we can go

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,210
to the party afterwards I want to first

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,850
off say a big thanks to the organizers

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,399
they put together a beautiful amazing

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,620
wonderful event so if you guys could all

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:44,100
give the organizers a round of applause

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:47,760
I owe them all so much for helping me

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,559
out so and I'm completely honored to be

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,260
up here with all these other great

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,070
speakers I do have to give a quick

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,379
disclaimer really quick my slides do

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,530
feature some like optical illusions and

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,199
animations that if you feel like visual

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,060
sensitivity I will not be offended if

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,490
you need to get up and like go outside

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,000
and take a walk because you have to take

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,350
please take care of yourself first I'll

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,640
try to give you a warning before

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:20,460
something visually animated pops up on

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,460
the screen but today we're going to talk

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,159
about CSS and art history and all of the

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,390
wonderful things that we have in common

00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:33,000
as a front-end developer we work in an

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,520
industry where our job is to build

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,259
things for public consumption and the

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,770
thing is is that often like we're given

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,020
sets of designs and photographs and text

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,990
and we have to put that all together in

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:53,729
order to tell a story on a website and

00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:56,340
what better place to look at for

00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:02,579
inspiration of visual storytelling than

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:05,130
art history so the object of art is not

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,030
to reproduce reality but to create a

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,580
reality of the same intensity and

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:14,660
effective storytelling in our

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:17,540
it comes from a long long history of

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,970
patterns and symbolism and visual cues

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,810
that have been developed over the course

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,580
of time and what's interesting is that

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,060
today we're kind of in the opposite

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,890
situation back in medieval times and in

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,060
the Renaissance illiteracy was the

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,080
majority of like people weren't as

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,480
capable of reading as they are today

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,750
obviously and when we work on websites

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:47,420
our job is often to make text available

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:49,670
and readable however we're still working

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,770
in a two-dimensional media we are still

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,780
working with a screen that has quite a

00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:59,930
lot in common with the canvas and with

00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:01,280
the frame so during this talk there's

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,160
going to be a lot of like little

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,110
examples of fun CSS things that I felt

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,360
inspired to share with you

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,220
this is one of my favorite websites it's

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,340
actually in flash but I'm working on

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,640
building like CSS JavaScript version of

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,810
it but I just wanted to show you this is

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,239
animated and moves around a lot

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,700
it's a game called first-person Tetris

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:32,239
you can go to first-person Tetris calm I

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:35,120
waste a lot of time playing this so

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,750
instead of the pieces rotating the whole

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,239
screen rotates and the reason why I'm

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,820
showing this to you is because we often

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,900
forget that like as long as we look at

00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,519
the physical world the three

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,500
dimensionality of vision seems to offer

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,810
no problem until we recall that the

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,910
optical input for all of our visual

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,570
experience consists of two-dimensional

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:59,330
projections on the retina like this is a

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,760
game but it's also a piece of art

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,130
because it's a two-dimensional

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:11,049
representation of space that you have a

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:13,730
three-dimensional relationship with see

00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,989
I've only ever gotten to level 10 so if

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,669
you can get past level 10 because it

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,720
starts going really fast and then you

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:19,720
get really really dizzy

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:30,370
so like I was saying it's we're dealing

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,040
with like a two dimensional world right

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,840
on our screens and our screens give us

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,190
access to the same things that you have

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,050
access to when you're putting together a

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,750
painting we have access to space and

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,669
lines and light and color and all these

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,940
things that come together to make form

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:47,860
which is what we are talking about when

00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,400
we look at art history is the nature of

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:57,250
form so let's break that down a little

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:59,620
bit more so this is a wonderful Georgia

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:03,100
O'Keeffe quote that I love where she's

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,070
talking about what it is to make art the

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:10,419
reason why we elevate art is because art

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:13,150
gives you the chance it gives you a

00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:18,639
chance to have an intimate emotional

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:20,590
relationship with something and that

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,100
intimate emotional relationship comes

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,139
from the arrangement of shapes and lines

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:30,460
and color and all of these things that

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:34,479
are just two-dimensional tools and we

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:38,830
have access to with CSS they all

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:41,020
contribute to expression so starting

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,610
back from like way way beginning these

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,240
are cave paintings in the South of

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,840
France

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,460
from 30,000 to 32,000 years ago it's

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,830
kind of hard to carbon-date these things

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,440
but you can see that there is already an

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,270
understanding of form like there's white

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,900
and there's dark so there's an

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:01,180
understanding of highlighting and

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,240
saturation there's movement the animals

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,270
are running across the rock right but

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,060
just like early web design before we had

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,380
access to like flexbox and CSS grid and

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,550
all these really cool things that we

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:18,389
have now just like in art history CSS

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:22,120
was used in basic motifs that were

00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:24,010
changed with trends across time so cave

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,830
paintings being the earliest and then

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,630
maybe you look at greco-roman vase art

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,880
and then you look at the motifs of

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,760
medieval art they're generally all

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,080
sticking to the same motif in the same

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,449
way that very very

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,780
very early web development stuck to the

00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:45,960
same motif but then we have the

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:50,259
Renaissance and the Renaissance was

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,840
responsible for basically making us go

00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:55,810
from a representational form of art to a

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,909
realistic form of art and I believe that

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,939
right now we exist in a sort of

00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:02,740
Renaissance period of CSS where we have

00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:05,770
access to all of these wonderful cool

00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,669
new tools but we're still doing the job

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,960
of tradesmen and craftsmen we're still

00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:14,050
dictated to us what it is that we're

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,560
communicating through our web

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:19,599
development onto the screen same as how

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,550
the artists during the Renaissance were

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,930
usually patronized by the Medici in the

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:30,009
family and the families in the countries

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:33,430
all across all across Europe and one of

00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:35,949
the greatest contributions of the

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:40,599
Renaissance to art was the concept of

00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:43,150
vanishing point so a vanishing point is

00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:47,379
a geometrical representation of an

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:50,050
expression of space by locating a point

00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:51,539
on the horizon and pulling it into the

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,339
foreground you're able to create

00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,979
three-dimensional objects so before

00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:59,110
during medieval and like on Greek vases

00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:02,740
you would see a very flat

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:05,770
two-dimensional picture of a person but

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,849
now with vanishing points we have the

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:11,500
ability to truly understand space and

00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:13,539
here you can see the very famous Last

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,870
Supper which is a fresco by Leonardo da

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:18,909
Vinci and here he takes great advantage

00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:22,620
of the vanishing point but not only that

00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:25,240
there's also hidden messages with this

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,849
composition in and of itself the fact

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,089
that the vanishing point is centred and

00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:33,180
the horizon is centred is a method of

00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:35,890
demonstrating symmetry and symmetry

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,320
demonstrates perfection because for two

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,209
things to be equal on both sides that is

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,219
perfection and back in the Renaissance

00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:48,120
this was considered godliness

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:49,740
so we derive this expectation

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,600
perfection and centering and it's

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,330
probably why all of us have to struggle

00:08:51,600 --> 00:09:03,930
with vertical center alignment so much

00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:08,130
to this day because of this crap here is

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:11,910
a more intense version if after looking

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,440
at where the horizon exists and the

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,450
vanishing point exists in the last

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,580
supper we can kind of take it to the

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,180
next level with Rafael in his fresco the

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,550
School of Athens which is in the Vatican

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:26,220
the vanishing point itself is actually

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,500
between Plato and Aristotle therefore

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,330
centering our focus on the conversation

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,910
that is happening between the two

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:38,460
characters in the center however there's

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:40,980
also lines of of geometric form that are

00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,690
happening in the foreground and with the

00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,850
crossing of the lines we see that this

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:50,160
is like a much more complex version of

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:58,920
what was started in the Renaissance like

00:09:50,160 --> 00:10:04,440
this is the the growth of it and you can

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:06,990
do it with CSS this is vanishing points

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,700
being executed with prospective origin

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:19,440
and because my slides are all HTML and

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:22,410
CSS I can show you how I did it so all

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,980
this right here is how I'm able to

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:29,670
execute the same thing that da Vinci and

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:33,120
Raphael executed in my code

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:36,510
so using vanishing points also gives us

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,920
access to depth and in that same sense

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,500
that we have access to depth with

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,120
vanishing points our screens are like

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,920
windows they're showing us what is

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,529
within in the same way that a frame

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,050
shows you what is within a painting and

00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:50,670
this was the big movement that happened

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,150
in the Renaissance and kind of defined

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,510
art for the next few motifs into the

00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,300
Baroque period

00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:01,840
and the neoclassical period which is

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:04,630
still kind of happening today I love

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,460
this piece of art it's cannot pronounce

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,080
his name I wish I could I'm horrible at

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,110
pronouncing things but it kind of looks

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,380
familiar right like you've seen this

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:20,380
pose before except not on Law & Order

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:23,500
SVU and that's because it is a physical

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:27,820
representation of Napoleon the first at

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:31,030
his coronation painted by angrist so you

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:35,140
can see here the artist Wylie took

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:36,970
inspiration and we're still like dealing

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,310
with depth and dealing with these

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,290
patterns and we haven't understand

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,930
inherent cultural understanding of these

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:47,800
patterns like you understand that I see

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:51,820
is pronouncing that he is the king but

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:57,400
in the same way that IKEA is copying

00:11:51,820 --> 00:12:01,240
Napoleon Napoleon is copying god this is

00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:04,150
yawns onyx Ghent Altarpiece God the

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,520
Father it's a panel within an altarpiece

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:11,400
with multiple panels and you can see the

00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:16,120
similarities between God the Father and

00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:18,820
Napoleon and we continue to use these

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,340
similar patterns in CSS with the

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,680
prevalence of hamburger menus and these

00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,920
representations that we all understand

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,140
and have a user experience that is

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,970
cohesive and everyone across the board

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,520
gets that and so I think that as a

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,910
community we should always be aware of

00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,700
those choices that are being made and

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:41,830
what that means for the future

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:48,280
generations of web development and the

00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:51,040
things that we're passing along but you

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,570
know you don't need to go to school and

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,400
get a masters degree to be an artist

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:58,270
anybody can be an artist anybody can

00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,350
create things just like you can create

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:04,150
anything out of CSS with your code and I

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,130
think that looking at the artists of

00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,300
today is going to help us figure out

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,490
what the future of CSS looks like

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,980
after the neoclassical period which was

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,420
what we just saw with Napoleon we had

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,399
the advent of photography and

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,009
photography meant that we no longer

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,500
needed paintings to represent real life

00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:25,920
because with photographs we could

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:28,139
document real life much quicker albeit

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,660
slightly expensive but not nearly as

00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,750
expensive as hiring an artist to paint

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,889
something for you at the same time

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,990
psychology was being developed and

00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:39,600
people were being encouraged to explore

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,790
their feelings and emotions so during

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:50,540
this period that's when we had the birth

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:54,180
of abstract art and now we're looking at

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,779
not the figure within but the figure on

00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:00,480
the canvas as a surface is just as

00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:03,930
important to look at in terms of art as

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,329
the canvas as a window and here we have

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,730
a piece by Chuck Close it's a portrait

00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:12,209
of Kara Walker who's also a famous

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:14,269
artist who I adore and what's

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,759
interesting is that Chuck Close

00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:19,529
abstracts the portrait by painting

00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:22,889
individual water colors just like pixels

00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:26,370
and therefore turning our focus away

00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:28,170
from the photograph as a whole and the

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,029
image the figure of Kara Walker as a

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:34,170
whole and instead we have a chance to

00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:35,519
focus on what is on the canvas and the

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,160
texture and the color and the

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,990
abstraction and I think that we are

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,139
going to see more and more of this in

00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,839
the future with CSS as we become more

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:50,939
aware of the screen as a surface as

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:53,970
opposed to a window little side trivia

00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:58,670
about Chuck Close he has bear with me

00:14:53,970 --> 00:15:02,160
while I process Pro so prosopagnosia

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:05,459
which is face blindness so when he

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,470
paints these portraits he will look at

00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:09,029
the photo and look back at the painting

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,370
and go back and forth and he actually

00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:13,889
like doesn't recognize the person while

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,410
he's doing these paintings which is why

00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:18,779
like what people have theorized is why

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,690
his painting seems so photographic

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:24,870
because he is so able to

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,850
separate himself from the person who

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:30,170
he's painting and he just sees the

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:33,930
elements of what he's working with and

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:36,030
in the same way that we work with pixels

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,220
and now we're working with like CSS grid

00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:41,220
and stuff we can look at this piece and

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,650
notice how it's being abstracted into

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,570
something that is completely different

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:49,800
from the way we used to handle art and

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:53,150
it ran across this very interesting

00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,920
piece that Ivana showed me earlier today

00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,230
using typography portrait by Carolyn

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,350
Portugal she uses typography and SVG

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,570
animation to deconstruct and subvert the

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,430
meaning of the text so just like check

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:08,610
closes subverting the meaning of the

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:11,970
portrait we can subvert the meaning of

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,070
the text that we're given to display on

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,800
a website to provide information and we

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,800
can provide information of our own

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
making

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:31,170
even more deeply abstracted we can look

00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:34,769
at Mark Rothko's paintings of color and

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:37,920
when we look at these what you don't

00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:39,899
know is that there's tiny thin layers of

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,540
color across the whole canvas Mark

00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,879
Rothko would paint very very thin layers

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:49,110
over and over and over to develop this

00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:51,329
glowing Lumosity something that I akin a

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,939
lot to the fact that our screens are

00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:55,860
actually light glowing from behind and

00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:57,929
so I like to look at Rothko and consider

00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,839
the fact that when we're creating

00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:03,089
something with CSS oftentimes color and

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,579
light have a lot to do with the

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:08,130
expression and the emotion that is

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:11,789
caused by what you're looking at on your

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:15,089
screen in 1816 Schopenhauer wrote on

00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:18,209
vision and color which explained his

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:22,049
theory of the physiological rate of

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:26,579
intensity of color saturation and he

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:30,210
developed a spectrum of color that he

00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:32,940
deemed high too low too high too low

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,520
intensity with black on one end of the

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,429
spectrum moving into violet blue and

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,679
green green and red being the center the

00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:43,440
highest contrasting moving down into

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:45,929
orange yellow and white and you can see

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,679
here there's no green there's no red

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:53,789
this is a very subdued painting with

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,580
notes of violet and notes of blue and we

00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:58,909
have a kind of calming sense when we

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:04,140
look at this painting the colors

00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:05,909
communicate to us a sense of peace but

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,480
when you look at something like orange

00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:13,020
and yellow it drives up your heartrate

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:18,270
it gets you excited it is full of

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:21,029
intensity and in the same way that you

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,809
can abstract down a painting into color

00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:29,730
to express emotion you can do so with

00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:31,860
CSS in the screen and color we can't

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:35,140
always look at color as it really is

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,480
sometimes it's determined by the context

00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:42,640
and here light and color help to define

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:45,550
space but here we have the absence of

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,680
color the absence of saturation helps us

00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:51,850
to define space so this is a piece of

00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:56,080
optical art by Bridget Riley she was

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:58,990
basically the front runner of this art

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,760
motif and she was also the first woman

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,340
to win an International Prize in

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,380
painting at the Venice Biennial in 1968

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,420
and what she's creating here is she's

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,730
expressing movement by manipulating the

00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,650
surface and depth with the contour and

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,290
saturation this is something that we

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,750
could execute ourselves with code by

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,790
manipulating a line by manipulating its

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:22,210
curvature and it creates a wonderful

00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:24,820
sense of tension and sense of movement

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,680
across the page even though it's static

00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,600
there's no movement in it but as you

00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:34,080
look at it it begins to kind of wave

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,080
back and forth

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:47,380
and to give you a sense of how we can

00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:50,120
utilize these abstractions through code

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:54,980
this is a project that my friend Ainsley

00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:58,190
Wagner worked on where she took sound

00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:01,000
and used it to manipulate an abstract

00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:03,139
representation with colors and light and

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:10,070
they just this wonderful performance

00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:13,039
piece that I love so this is making art

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:17,990
with code this is like the most abstract

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:20,330
that you can get and as we move towards

00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,639
pure expression and away from our

00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:26,870
dependency on text and our dependency on

00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:29,899
like newspapers derivative layouts with

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,669
columns and rows of text I hope that you

00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:35,019
all are a little inspired to go out and

00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:36,880
make something fun and interesting thing

00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:37,400
thank you

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,300
[Applause]
