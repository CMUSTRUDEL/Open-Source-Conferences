00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,840
accent is not too bad we can we can get

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,090
that through there yeah we also have a

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,830
code of conduct of course and the

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,180
official kind of statement there is be

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,460
excellent to each other if you have any

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,930
problem you know reach out to us or any

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:25,050
of the organizers and we'll get that

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:27,330
sorted okay so if you've been to other

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,250
CSS comps GS comps before you might

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:34,110
notice we are in a brand new venue this

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,910
year arena Hall and oh and this is where

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,690
it is in the city this is where you are

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,990
right now just what if someone asks you

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,990
later

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,710
and so this amazing building was built

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,710
in nineteen twenty seven twenty eight

00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:53,070
and at the time it was the largest like

00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:58,920
free span in all of Europe and it was

00:02:53,070 --> 00:03:00,720
built to house buses for the transit

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,970
company and I thought this was really

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,920
cool because the bus was also the

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,700
world's largest bus at the time this is

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,130
the 1927 store double-decker and so they

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,020
would fill this whole space with the

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,800
buses and clean them and store all of

00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,660
the buses here we've come a long way I

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,670
feel like it was built in 1927 in

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,860
Australia I would not want to be under

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,730
the roof but considering its German it's

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,890
going to be here forever okay so we have

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,390
a ton of good sponsors you can see all

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,800

and keep up so at this point in in the

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,930
emcee presentations we kind of looked

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,640
through the previous ones and there was

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,330
Jed and there was Nick and there was a

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,100
ton of puns and a lot of CSS puns and

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,540
they were really good and I don't know

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,459
if you get this thing when you try to do

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,810
puns but whenever anybody says one you

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,479
like that was really good and I can't

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,860
use that now and I just think we're kind

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,889
of done there they're all kind of

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,060
through

00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,520
so I kind of wanted to do something

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,750
different and we we kind of discussed

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,220
back and forth of what we're going to do

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,350
and we kind of came up with with

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,270
something that we've called the CSS come

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:41,139
party pack hashtag CSS compound crack

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:44,169
trademark patent pending yeah so yeah so

00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:47,410
one of the amazing things about this

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:50,500
event about J's comp and this whole week

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,030
of events is the community right such an

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,850
amazing community there's so much going

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,850
on we really like being together with

00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,610
everyone but maybe you don't have a

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:05,289
community maybe you work remote and you

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:07,870
really want that feeling so I don't know

00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,280
if anybody has kind of knows me and I've

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,220
seen the things that I do I kind of like

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,690
to do this thing that I call bad cop'

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,330
development where you take a good thing

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:20,470
and you make it bad and you learn from

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:22,449
it and I've been working from home the

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,509
last con a couple of years and one thing

00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,930
that I've kind of missed is

00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:29,680
passive-agressive

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,660
office notes and this is kind of like

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,430
whenever I find a note in my house it's

00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,639
me that left it to me oh you left the

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,169
banana out good one so I kind of wanted

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,550
to bring this back into back into my

00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:43,360
life so I made a passive-aggressive

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,460
office simulator blackpot it's going to

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,880
keep everyone kind of going and it's

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,139
very intelligent it's very well fed with

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,490
real live data

00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,860
don't forget the organ Amish lunch later

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,510
on what's the other no explanation can

00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,770
go to that this is the third time this

00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,909
year we've had to buy new folks at the

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,520
office please don't take these home

00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:03,340
they're for everyone I actually have to

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,930
buy folks over a couple of years and it

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,849
kind of remembers things as well so

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,530
it'll be like whoever left the yogurt in

00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:09,699
the fridge please remove it and you're

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,440
kind of sitting there and you forget

00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,940
about it and then a couple of weeks

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,909
later we like well it looks like no one

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,880
who removed the yogurt classic office

00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:22,080
life you can get it today see home accom

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,080
office has simulator

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,210
all right so not only do we benefit from

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:33,050
excellent German engineering in this

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:35,539
amazing space but we benefit from German

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,430
design and things like Bauhaus that are

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:40,430
incorporated today and all kinds of

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,759
design and typography and so what could

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:47,389
be a really good way to tribute the

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,919
great German laughing everybody here

00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:51,979
really appreciates design that's a big

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:54,050
part of CSS and of course I'm kind of

00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,669
again in this mindset of a bad cop

00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:00,379
development so I've created something

00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:01,789
called smell vodka and anybody with any

00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:04,610
sense is going to start feeling

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:07,819
uncomfortable at the kerning in this

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,529
Helvetica you can actually install this

00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:10,159
on your machine and this is what it

00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:14,509
looks like

00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:17,629
or someone else's machine here's tumblr

00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:21,080
I can hear some the babies are crying

00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:21,710
the children are screaming you can get

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,080

machine mow vet occur is the future all

00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,339
right and so we also know that CSS has

00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:46,209
come a long way and people have done

00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:49,669
amazing games and animations created

00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:53,709
animation libraries and really great

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:57,529
code pen examples of these silky smooth

00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:58,999
animation remember we do that yeah we

00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:00,169
have a lot of people that are going to

00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:01,669
talk about animations and things like

00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:03,919
this as well and it's super exciting and

00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:08,120
of course I'm the party pooper

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:11,199
so CSS come party pack I have created

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,610
