00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,670
today I spoke about a project that I've

00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,380
been working on for about a year called

00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,110
style components get ready for the

00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,390
future of CSS statement CSS is real

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,150
development and we do value it CSS MJS

00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:13,420
you should definitely do a personal

00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:15,760
project that is quite ambitious together

00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,479
and then you can get amazing results art

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,030
history and its relationship with CSS

00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,800
optimizing the delivery of our CSS and

00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,619
other critical resources on the webpage

00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,350
how CSS gets made really I'm basically

00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,800
lab coding a CSS game for everybody here

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,930
today

00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:45,719
[Applause]

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:45,719
[Music]

00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,220
[Music]

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:59,910
what I love about the conference is the

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,850
how the talks are scheduled in near

00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:05,340
twine and the balance of technical and

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,800
non-technical remarkable group of people

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,720
such a collection of skills and

00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,400
backgrounds I just feel like the

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,440
entirety of the conference is so well

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,120
done and thoughtfully done that's that's

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,430
what makes me excited to come to it

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,500
because I know that about it people are

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,720
all in one place at the same time and

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,340
then during our actually outside and

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,560
talks people can communicate and talk

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,970
about things they've just heard well I

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,500
mean that the first thing is definitely

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,610
offering chakra in the first place you

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,560
are one of the first conferences that

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,660
I've ever heard that's done that it's

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,180
actually made a much warmer safer

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,739
environment for everyone in the future

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,750
maybe you put together a personal

00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,300
project maybe you come to the conference

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,100
and you see someone speak and you say

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,110
hey I can do that and you submit a

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,330
proposal and then you're on stage next

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,510
year I just met somebody who implemented

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,769
CSS grid in browsers I never really get

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,200
to talk to the actual implementers of

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,400
these things that I use in love I feel

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,540
like every couple of years there is

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,700
something new and there's something new

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,200
to learn and this conference has the

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,200
best people to teach you the best things

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,759
[Applause]

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,759
[Music]

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,320
we have of course a bigger venue and

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,720
more opportunities for people to

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,730
interact the best part is that despite

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,620
the bigger venue or thanks to the bigger

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,480
venue the community spirit remains the

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,880
same I think we need these events to

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,650
bring diverse and different positions

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,150
together we need all those people from

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,770
different countries in one room to

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,270
actually make progress and come to new

00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,650
insights and I think it's already

00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,840
happening here today and that's great

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,850
and like over the years it feels like a

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,850
big family reunion every year

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:57,200
