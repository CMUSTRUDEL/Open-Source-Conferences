Ember.js is JavaScript framework for building feature rich and very responsive applications. This session will provide an overview of Ember.js and demonstrate test-driven development of single-page web applications.

I will also explain Ember.js' data bindings that allow for creation of views that update automatically in response to model changes. I will demo ease of Ember.js and Rails integration. Finally, I will utilize Ember.js components to create reusable UI elements.
In summary, Ember.js is a great framework for creating complex single-page applications. Attendees will leave the talk with a solid understanding of Ember.js test-driven development process.
