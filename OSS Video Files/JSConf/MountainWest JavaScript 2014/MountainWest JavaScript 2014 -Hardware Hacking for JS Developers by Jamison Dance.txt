Title: MountainWest JavaScript 2014 -Hardware Hacking for JS Developers by Jamison Dance
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: MountainWest JavaScript 2014
Description: 
	By Jamison Dance

Building things that interact with the physical world can be profoundly satisfying. However, if you work high up the abstraction ladder hardware hacking can seem a scary place full of scary things like assembly, microcontrollers, C, solder fumes, and the risk of death by electrocution. Fear not! None of those things are actually scary. Okay, death is scary, but highly unlikely!
We'll learn how JavaScript makes it super easy to get started hacking on hardware, including Arduinos, drones, and a few other gadgets. We'll also show off some live demos of some working projects, and the code that powers them. Hardware hacking is fun, and you can do it.

today we're going to talk about hardware

00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,430
hacking for jas developers I hope you

00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,460
learned two things from this talk oh oh

00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,140
my intro I'm Jerguson on Twitter I do a

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,630
podcast called Jess jabber with Chuck

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,670
who's sitting right there my work at ITV

00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,470
I discovered that I was getting a lot of

00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,230
recruiter spam so I actually changed my

00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,330
job title to his illustrious Majesty

00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,690
grand Vista Roy of code and then since

00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,309
then no recruiter spam at all so Stanley

00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,920
was telling the truth that is my title

00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:57,290
at work so two things I hope you learned

00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,640
today one is that I am a serious artist

00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:02,630
with serious art skills as you'll see

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,180
and the other one is that you guys all

00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,910
have magical powers so in the last

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,560
several years the barriers of entry to

00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,690
doing things with Hardware have just

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,310
dropped to the floor the fact that you

00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,509
know how to do software means you don't

00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,130
really need to know anything about

00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:18,080
hardware you can just do amazing things

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,850
by the virtue the fact that you know

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,290
software so we're going to talk about

00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,670
some of the magic powers here's the the

00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,860
sum total of all knowledge about

00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,390
hardware that big blob and the little

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,310
red dot is all the things you know to

00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,679
build cool stuff which is not very much

00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,860
so talk about all you need to know this

00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:39,350
is all you need to know so the plus 5 V

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,020
means that current comes out of some

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,880
source this little can you see my mouse

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,860
yeah who needs a laser pointer this

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,780
little thing means there's a switch so

00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,880
this circuit is disconnected right now

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,069
but you can close this switch to make

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,800
current flow from here it flows through

00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:56,929
this triangle thing which is a diode

00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,840
it'll be an LED and all our stuff and

00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:01,910
then it flows to ground so current flows

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,770
from power maybe throw a switch if you

00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,330
connect it it then goes through here

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,250
through this diode to ground that's

00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,580
that's it now you know all that I know

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,340
about hardware aren't you excited for

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,690
this talk now ok so the magic spell

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,819
number one we're going to talk about is

00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,550
how you can take physical input from the

00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:25,099
real world and send it to your computer

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:27,110
and maybe the cloud I don't know stuff

00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:29,530
like that so to do that we're going to

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:33,349
talk about a library called Johnny 5

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,860
Johnny 5 is a node library that is

00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:35,990
written

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,460
to help you communicate through a USB

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:41,870
drive or USB port to a hardware device

00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,790
and I'll show a little bit of code and a

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,050
small demo example of how you can do

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,770
stuff with it and then we'll get into a

00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:52,010
little bit more intense example pay no

00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,600
attention to my Twitter below all right

00:02:52,010 --> 00:03:03,010
can everybody see this is this big

00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:08,450
enough is this right enough okay then

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:11,030
also will do that ok so we require

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:14,300
Johnny Five it's just a library we

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,980
require we create a new board object and

00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,180
that just initializes the board and then

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:23,239
it gives a call back it's kind of like a

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,610
jquery ish abstraction over hardware so

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,690
that you deal with these high-level

00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,459
concepts like callbacks and events

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,560
instead of dealing with like reading

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,910
ones and zeros and stuff so when the

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,340
board is ready we'll call this board

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:40,070
ready function I think I have this other

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:41,989
one down here this is not I just gave

00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,100
away my my talk that wasn't supposed to

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:49,850
be come to that alright so we're going

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:51,860
to run this code codes button demo and

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:55,610
then it's going to start up and then the

00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:59,570
board is ready and now we'll talk about

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:02,510
the rest of this stuff in here so this

00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,610
pin thing the Arduino boards have a

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,519
bunch of pins where you can plug wires

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,440
into you can basically read from them or

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,810
write to them when you read from them

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,709
you're just reading whether electricity

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:18,080
oh thanks database we're reading whether

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,510
electricity is being sent into the board

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,950
or not you just basically get a 1 or 0

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,630
when you're writing to it you're just

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,520
either writing full-on or you're not

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,340
writing anything um that's with digital

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,850
pins so right now we're saying will read

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,560
from pin 1 or sorry pin to every time we

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:39,760
read a value from it will call this call

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:41,690
back so that is what this code will do

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,910
that was commented out for some reason

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,240
so i'm going to rerun this so there's a

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,639
big fat red button connected to pin to

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,800
right now

00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,550
when I press it amazing things will

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,800
happen down there hooray amazing things

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,120
so one thing you might notice is that's

00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,650
really noisy I press the button three

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,949
times and it spit out like a trillion

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,009
values right that's that seems less than

00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:06,629
ideal so how would you deal with this

00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:08,580
well we have tools in JavaScript to deal

00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:09,960
with avoiding calling a function a bunch

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,150
of times right do you guys know i

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,439
underscore d bounces ready bouncing in

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,360
general have ever used that to prevent

00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,520
some call back from being called too

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,719
many times in a certain time period so

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,879
we can do that same thing with hardware

00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:24,750
it's just JavaScript right so we can use

00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,639
underscore with hardware why not so our

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,289
problem is this callback is being called

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,050
too many times we just want it to be

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:32,340
called once for each button press so

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,129
we'll just you bounce it will only call

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,689
it once within a 200 millisecond window

00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:42,779
so we change that restart this guy and

00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:44,729
then I'll make this bigger and the board

00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,650
is ready then we press it once and we

00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,180
only get one thing so that's just kind

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,419
of to show you the basics of Johnny Five

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,909
how it works and how you can manipulate

00:05:50,419 --> 00:06:08,370
stuff with JavaScript we'll do another

00:05:52,909 --> 00:06:11,539
example now do that looks cool so if we

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,539
go back to the slides

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,040
all right here we go so the demo I'm

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,390
going to show right now is super simple

00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,260
we're just going to take some input from

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:30,420
the Arduino through Johnny Five turn it

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,430
into socket i/o commands the reason I'm

00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,500
using reveal j/s here is because I

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,150
needed to do this demo otherwise my

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,280
slides could just be like a folder in

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,800
finder that I would go through but since

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,260
I want to control the slides from the

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,480
hardware socket i/o will send a command

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,400
to the javascript javascript will in the

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,140
browser will talk to reveal and change

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,480
the slides hopefully if everything works

00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,660
so there's a button down here that I

00:06:51,480 --> 00:07:02,570
press and it goes forward they can go

00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:04,890
back and that is pretty neat all right

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:10,470
now I'm going to kill this guy because

00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:13,830
it gets monkey and then we'll start this

00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,060
up again and don't spoil it okay another

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,490
thing you might notice is it's pretty

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,320
boring that this button doesn't really

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,020
do anything besides change the slides so

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,950
I made it play the inception noise for

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:28,740
you I just thought that was cooler cool

00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:31,050
okay so that's that's an example of how

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,430
you can take out our sorry inputs from

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,370
the physical world and send them to your

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,880
computer I mean slides changing isn't

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,620
that cool if you look at it in its own

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,210
context but you could replace that with

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,440
anything you want right you could send

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,430
tweets you could commit code by like

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,310
punching a giant button how cool would

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,980
that be so just use your imagination so

00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,350
the next spell is where you take yeah

00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,300
ship it with a big button a big ship it

00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,670
button that'd be sweet the next magic

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,230
spell is where you take input into your

00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,170
computer and turn it into physical

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:07,260
output in the real world that could come

00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:10,320
from the cloud too and it will but first

00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,280
for some background how many of you know

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,970
what twitch plays Pokemon is ok

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,770
everybody turn to your neighbor and

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,740
explain what twitch plays Pokemon just

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:22,260
kidding so twitch plays Pokemon is the

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,180
internet version of a million monkeys on

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:28,440
a million keyboards typing Shakespeare

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,450
so someone took a gameboy emulator and

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,950
hooked it up to this live streaming

00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,960
service with a chat room

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,780
so that chat commands in this chat room

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,460
will go into the emulator and do things

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,260
in the game they hooked it up to Pokemon

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,260
so there was a hundred thousand people

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,000
typing like up select start in this

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,390
pokemon game and basically doing their

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,130
best to ruin it they beat it after like

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,970
six weeks is pretty amazing but is

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,040
really fun to watch so today inspired by

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,320
this I want to do Mountain West jazz

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,480
plays light Bach light pot is a friendly

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,120
robot on this table that loves you and

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,760
and wants to make you happy and he'll do

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,820
that by having you play a game so if if

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,630
people aren't in the IRC channel you

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,100
should go there now but not so many

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,700
people that I can't connect to the

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,100
internet because then this won't work so

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,240
if you yeah this is the IRC channel you

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,910
can go there in a browser if you go to

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,860
web chat that free node net if you have

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,840
an IRC client then you probably don't

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,530
need that but we're gonna we're going to

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,320
do some IRC stuff so light bot can do

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,480
four things this is lie bought by the

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,090
way he has a cool name and looks less

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,520
cool but it's still pretty fun so like I

00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,320
can start the game you can play which

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,120
means you take a turn in the game and he

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,220
can go faster or slower so the actual

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,840
game is the lights will just like bounce

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,340
back and forth between here you're

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,780
trying to stop it on the red light and

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,770
if you do that you win otherwise you

00:09:51,780 --> 00:10:02,900
lose he has a kill command don't don't

00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:08,670
do light bot kill we will die alright so

00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:16,980
let me start this and then I do not know

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:19,110
why that is there let's go to hear and

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,290
see if Y pop joined can everybody see

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,290
this

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,940
oh yeah cloud to but plus IRC but is

00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:33,190
that's why it says IRC blood so people

00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,500
already typing stuff so when you made it

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,480
go really fast that's why it's doing the

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:42,510
strobe mode someone should type light

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:44,560
but play and then it'll oh you guys lost

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,560
so you have to type light BOTS start

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:52,420
again to make it start up again and you

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,860
can speed it up or slow down yeah this

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,170
is so imagine this but with a hundred

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,810
thousand people and that's twitch plays

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,960
pokemon but this is cool right we're all

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,890
through the magic of the cloud

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,290
participating in the real world with

00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,060
this little robot thing oh yeah someone

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:12,160
type laibach he'll lie pot only gives

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:17,790
hugs not deaf so yes that is light bah

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,790
i'm going to apply to you guys good word

00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:25,840
I'm gonna make y paco to sleep now way

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:33,400
more stuff to talk about ok back to

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:35,440
slides deep doo ok there's there's a

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,690
couple more demos one of them is with

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,570
this xbox controller so you can actually

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:43,810
use input from the xbox controller and

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:46,780
do cool hardware stuff so light bot go

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:50,790
back to your home and I already have

00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,790
this plugged in because I'm so prepared

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,170
alright so there's a library called node

00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,470
xbox controller it basically gives you a

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,270
bunch of events you can bind to for all

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,040
of the buttons on the xbox controller so

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,600
you can listen on stuff for the the

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,950
little thumb sticks and all these

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:13,290
individual buttons I'll show you but

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:13,290
I'll do the demo first so you'll do node

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,550
hope this works ok cool so I just hacked

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,620
this is super simple program all it does

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,740
is when I press up it lights up the top

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:29,500
light left lights up the left flight

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,710
right right light down doesn't work

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,170
because this wiring is messed up um but

00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:40,410
if I jiggle it enough

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:45,550
I will move on to avoid embarrassment

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:49,050
cool so let me show you the code because

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,050
that'll come in handy in a little bit

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,199
alright so same thing as before we

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,449
require Johnny Five we also require the

00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:00,490
xbox controller library we use

00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:01,870
underscore to debounce more stuff but

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,180
making you bored we make a new xbox

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,639
controller this we can skip over because

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,910
it is super important but here we go

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,100
bourdon ready we make four LEDs and we

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,839
stick them in an object where the names

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:18,269
are just which direction they are on the

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:21,730
board and then when we move the left

00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:23,620
thumbstick we get this callback fire

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,110
that gives a position the position is

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,310
the X&Y coordinates of where the thumb

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:32,500
stick is it's between negative 2 30

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:35,170
something whatever to to the 15th is and

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,990
positive to the 15th so we normalize

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:41,380
that that's what this direction from

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,880
position thing is and then that turns

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,250
into left right up or down and then we

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,519
just turn that led on the reason we turn

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:50,260
all the LEDs off between each move is so

00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,899
I don't have to be smart and figure out

00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:56,380
which led used to be on or whatever so

00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:58,000
this is like not very much code right 12

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,120
lines of code or something we can we can

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,620
interact with physical devices with this

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,380
pretty complex input scheme it's a

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,430
little bit nicer than this giant fatty

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,730
button right it can do a lot of

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:13,660
different things how many of you guys

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:21,069
have played with drones before the AR

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:23,790
drums ok we have an xbox controller we

00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,790
have a drone

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:33,790
what should we do with these go to plug

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,450
the battery in first please no one steal

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:53,020
the Wi-Fi network for this drum that

00:14:36,450 --> 00:15:01,470
make my taco poorly it's supposed to

00:14:53,020 --> 00:15:09,460
twitch like that don't worry do then we

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:11,500
kill this thing get pain and then we

00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:21,220
hope no one has stolen the Wi-Fi network

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:24,820
yet and then codes drone okay cool so

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:29,680
the xbox controller is connected which

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:30,850
button should make it take off I'm going

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:37,300
to go with eight because that's the one

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:40,890
I picked so okay and it takes off you

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,890
can make it go up and down

00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:53,540
you all signed the waiver right um it

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,540
can like spin around yeah it's basically

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:59,080
a FPS controls so this thumb stick makes

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:03,170
it strafe and go forward and backwards

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:05,630
and I'm really bad at controlling it but

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:12,200
my two year old neighbor is pretty good

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:14,270
at it alright so that's it right like

00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:19,760
it's super easy to control physical

00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:21,140
devices with javascript and i'm going to

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,080
show you the code for this because it's

00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,610
it's simple i actually wrote this while

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,050
I was sitting it was supposed to flip

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,700
left and right while i press the

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,710
triggers but i never tested it so it

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,200
didn't work but imagine how cool would

00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,990
have been if it flipped around okay so

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,760
on the left move stick we just turn it

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:42,850
into a direction and then if it's

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,830
telling it to go up we this is the

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,530
ar.drone client you can tell it front so

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,990
when we press up on this joystick it'll

00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,850
send client out front which makes the

00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,590
jungle for it and the rest of it's

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,450
pretty similar right client that back if

00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,520
the direction is down hill strafe left

00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,800
and right so it's really it's not that

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,760
much code there's actually a parrot

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,069
ar.drone xbox module in npm already but

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,930
that is against the spirit of node to

00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:13,370
use something when you could rewrite it

00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:15,170
yourself so I rewrote it anyways the

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,959
other things that we showed where that

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,339
we did when we that I didn't talk about

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,079
our just a button so when it gets

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,860
pressed we take off and gets pressed we

00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:26,180
land yeah so it's super simple it's it's

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,880
not hard it on you can do cool things

00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,580
like impress your two year old neighbor

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,920
or maybe get a job but latter number

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,170
terial neighbors are cooler so so that's

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,060
the theme of the talk um these demos

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,190
themselves aren't like mind-blowing Lee

00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:43,430
amazing but just the fact that they were

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,140
so easy should be amazing to you because

00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't know anything about hardware I'm

00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,860
probably a mediocre developer at best

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,200
but I could still just like plug five

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,880
wires in and then make something cool or

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,260
i could buy these two off-the-shelf

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,650
things and hook them together through

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,930
java

00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:01,820
and then fly drones around in the

00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:03,350
library um so if that's that's kind of

00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,000
one thing I want you to take away from

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,590
the talk that you guys can do stuff that

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,850
that is amazing you can do things that

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,250
are way cooler than what I've done with

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:13,150
a little bit of time and effort and

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,150
