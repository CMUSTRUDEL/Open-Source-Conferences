In the future, search engines may be smart enough to understand how to index JavaScript single page applications (SPAs). That is not the case today, however. Solutions based on PhantomJS do exist to help get your SPA indexed, but there is a big difference between simply getting indexed and actually ranking high in Google's organic search rankings.
The "right way" to do SEO for SPAs requires building a complimentary server side application that renders content for search engines and pre-renders initial page loads for users. This talk will provide an overview of the challenges of SEO with single page applications, an explanation of why many common solutions out there are not sufficient and details of how you can implement a full stack JavaScript solution that rocks.
