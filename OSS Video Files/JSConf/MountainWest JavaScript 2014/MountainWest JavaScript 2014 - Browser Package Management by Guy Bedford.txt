Title: MountainWest JavaScript 2014 - Browser Package Management by Guy Bedford

Description: 
	We still don't have a sensible package management workflow for the browser. Instead we have various pieces of package management tooling that may or may not play well together. The main reason for this is the lack of agreement on a module system and module loader for the browser.
With the ES6 module specification getting very close to completion, we now have a module format and dynamic loader that are specified natively for the browser. The hope is that this will provide the stability we need to move us closer towards agreement on methods allowing module management in the browser to be as easy as using npm on the server.
The ES6 Module Loader polyfill enables these ES6 module loading methods in browsers today, and with builds the polyfill is suitable for production use. The loader can also be customized to support dynamically loading AMD, CommonJS and global scripts directly in the browser, providing an upgrade path for legacy modules.
jspm is a package management system for JavaScript that is built on top of these principles of ES6 modules and the ES6 dynamic loader from the core. It also provides a CDN and CLI for working with flat dependency-managed modules of any module format directly from GitHub or npm.
This talk will provide an overview of ES6 modules and the module loader, as well as providing examples of these techniques in action.
