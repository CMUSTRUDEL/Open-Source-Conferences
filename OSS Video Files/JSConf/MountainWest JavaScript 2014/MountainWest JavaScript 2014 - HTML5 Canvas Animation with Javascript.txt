Have you ever wondered how to make awesome canvas animations? This is where you can come learn about: Briefly talk about the Drawing API Basic Trigonometry for animation Basic motion (Velocity & Acceleration) Learn about radians & degrees. Just basically explain them and how to convert them. Learn about sine waves and how to animate using sine waves. The fun part will be motion. I will explain velocity, acceleration and show tons of code and demos. This talk will be more fun to you if you have a laptop and pull up my slides. I have a couple of demos that are interactive with the keypad. Do you want to animate awesome stuff? Then see you there!
