Title: MountainWest JavaScript 2014 - HTML5 Canvas Animation with Javascript
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: MountainWest JavaScript 2014
Description: 
	By Josh Robertson

Have you ever wondered how to make awesome canvas animations? This is where you can come learn about: Briefly talk about the Drawing API Basic Trigonometry for animation Basic motion (Velocity & Acceleration) Learn about radians & degrees. Just basically explain them and how to convert them. Learn about sine waves and how to animate using sine waves. The fun part will be motion. I will explain velocity, acceleration and show tons of code and demos. This talk will be more fun to you if you have a laptop and pull up my slides. I have a couple of demos that are interactive with the keypad. Do you want to animate awesome stuff? Then see you there!

unfortunately I did use grunt for my

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:42,000
slides but my port is leat 1337 so

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,979
hopefully that makes up for it alright

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,729
but I will probably use grunt after this

00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:51,809
okay so my name is Josh Robertson

00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:54,750
actually first if you want or you should

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,989
pull up my slides that doesn't cut off

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:02,190
okay there we go these are my slides

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:05,399
that is a zero and a capital L I guess I

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,440
don't have to talk too loud I have some

00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:10,050
demos that will interact the keyboard

00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,500
and so I highly recommend that you pull

00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,500
up my slides

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:21,090
alright let me know if you don't if you

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,630
want them ok so my name is Josh

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,930
Robertson for you locals I interned at a

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,460
place called Domo for three months

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,079
during the summers when I wasn't in

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,250
school I'm an open source enthusiast but

00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:39,600
unfortunately I haven't contributed much

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:42,000
yet but I will contribute hopefully soon

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,520
it's been kind of busy with because I

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,659
freelance off-time and so in school so

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,180
it's been kind of busy but I want to

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,210
contribute and that was one of my goals

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,219
for this year snowflake I just put this

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,049
on there too

00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,409
that was just my first canvas experiment

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,479
I just wanted to get that out there and

00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:04,200
it's on my github and code pen

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:08,220
I just will be using code pen for all my

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,820
demos because I love code pen and it

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,920
gives back data and stuff like that and

00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:18,180
also I got featured on the front page

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,430
one day randomly it was just like it was

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,510
like a math homothetic centers that's

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:27,120
the math room and I guess they liked it

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,449
and I also got tweeted out by Chris

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,570
quarter which is awesome okay so topics

00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:34,100
that I'll be covering for you how many

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,320
you have

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,870
use canvas here like pretty well they

00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,110
know it pretty well

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,760
okay well the beginning I guess how many

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,210
actually know the API and stuff that's

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,640
I'm trying to say sorry like okay

00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:51,470
alright so not that many of you I'll

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,380
just briefly go over it so that when you

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,480
see my demos you won't be too confused

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,570
my demos aren't that complex and I try

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,850
to write my code pretty simple for this

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,890
and we'll talk about basic trigonometry

00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,640
so we can animate stuff like cosine and

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:11,960
sine and basic motion so velocity

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:15,140
acceleration alright so first off what

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:18,530
is canvas it's a graphic so JavaScript

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,780
so it's an e html5 canvas is an easy and

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,960
powerful way to draw graphics using

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,210
javascript and canvas can also use a

00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,580
thing called context well you use

00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,290
context so you can issue commands

00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:37,100
through JavaScript so that you can draw

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:39,140
stuff and do whatever you want so one

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,500
little forewarning I do have lots of

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:47,000
demos which i think is a good thing

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:50,390
because canvas i think is better to see

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,280
the demos alright so this is the drawing

00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,430
API these are the main ones that I'll be

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,920
using they're the simplest and basics of

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,710
canvas 2d of course there's of course

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,020
like WebGL and stuff but stroke style

00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,610
will just change the color I just want

00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,740
to go through them briefly joke style

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,450
will change the color of a line so so if

00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,670
you have a rectangle or something it'll

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,150
fill in the color they're all pretty

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:16,340
basic line width is the width of a line

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,170
begin path so if you have you usually

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,780
always begin with the begin path that's

00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:22,040
just the proper way to do it and if

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,270
you're when you're drawing something so

00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,480
if you're going to draw a line you begin

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,400
a path and then you say move to which is

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,580
basically if you imagine it like a

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,620
drawing thing like I said move to will

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,390
just pick up your pencil and put it

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,160
somewhere otherwise if you're using line

00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,470
2 then it'll just draw all the way

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,750
across and you give it an x and y so

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,750
coordinates in the canvas system or the

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:47,690
canvas and a stroke you always just

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,900
stroke it which is basically just draw

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:54,350
at the end arc will draw I give you a

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,600
circle so remember it's XY radius the

00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,860
start angles usually zero because that's

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,110
just where you want to start and then

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,560
the end angle so this could give you a

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,770
circle oval and then clear rekt will

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,500
clear your canvas so just stop it and

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:12,710
fill rect will draw like a rectangle

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,030
with the XY width and height so those

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,030
are pretty basic and then save and

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,980
restore I don't use it much in my demos

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,010
because I just use objects and just

00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,710
store everything in that but if you have

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,360
just a huge block of lines and stuff

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,250
then you want to save and restore it and

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,990
if you have multiple colors I guess then

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,460
you want to save it and restore it it's

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,260
basically just putting it away and then

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,350
you can restore it later so you have

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,910
just save multiple colors so these are

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,820
pretty basics and then just tapping into

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:43,280
the API this is how you you can all see

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,230
that right okay if you don't you have my

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,960
hopefully my slides pulled up so tapping

00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,640
into the API you save our canvas is

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,670
usually the most normal part and then

00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,100
you say dr. Malak doc get element by ID

00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:58,670
if you in the HTML you'll see in my

00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:01,910
demos that you give it a ID if you want

00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:05,150
or you can query select it but you can

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,590
just say IDs the example and then you

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,240
give it the context so canvas is the

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,690
variable name and then you get contacts

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,490
2d so clear clear rect is the one that

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,560
these are all just same simple like I

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,180
said but it's basically just clears and

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,980
draws it clears and draws it clears and

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,960
draws it like stop-motion because you

00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,490
don't want pixels left over unless you

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,010
do want pixels left over which you'll

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,680
see in my first sign demo that you just

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,940
want to leave a trace of it basically

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,690
but if you're going to be animating and

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:36,440
stuff you'll usually clear it alright so

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:38,900
trigonometry people say oh I'm not

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,110
really good at numbers but you actually

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,840
hardly even deal with numbers there's no

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,190
need to be scared of math even if you

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,220
it's been a while since you've taken a

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:54,680
math class there's no need for you to be

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:55,820
scared of it most most canvas is usually

00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,520
just visualizing shapes and

00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,800
relationships and you deal with

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,129
positions distances and angles and you

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,830
never

00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:06,409
see the numbers 90% of the trig you need

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:09,169
in canvas and animating is just math

00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:10,459
sauce sign and math LOC cosine and I'll

00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:14,059
talk about it more once I start getting

00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:16,039
into my demos and I said beforehand that

00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:20,089
I'll talk about radians and degrees just

00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:22,819
a little bit is because canvas and I

00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:25,249
think computers just like radians more

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,929
so normally we sink in degrees and

00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:30,919
that's how we normally sink in so like

00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:33,379
90 degrees 180 degrees and one Radian

00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,319
may seem like a weird number 57 point

00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:40,999
two nine whatever but it actually works

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,740
out with two pi because two pi is a full

00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:45,830
circle you can see it's a full circle

00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:50,959
and pi is half a circle you can see that

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:52,819
two pi is actually one Radian equals six

00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,139
point two the number irradiance so it

00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:55,909
equals outlast I'm just trying to say

00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:58,669
but if you don't want to think in

00:07:55,909 --> 00:08:01,749
radians like pi to pi pi divided by two

00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:04,519
you can convert it into a formula so say

00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:06,769
I don't know what thirty-two point two

00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:10,339
degrees is in radians then you can

00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:12,469
convert it in this formula so radians

00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:14,479
equals two degrees so degrees you just

00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:16,399
give it in a number ninety eight hundred

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,139
eighty degrees whatever and then you

00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,050
multiply applying math dot pi divided by

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:24,189
180 and that's the proper way to convert

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,389
into radians and then when you give the

00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:28,879
when you give it you actually give it

00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,439
the radians degree or radians so that

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,509
because the computer won't think in

00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,419
degrees and then vice versa but you

00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:38,419
hardly use the other one so just feel

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,729
simple half a circle with radians you

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,360
get into the API you tap it in the API

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:46,009
so I just gave a variable radius 250 so

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,149
it's not just some arbitrary number in

00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:52,189
the arc so begin the path and then you

00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,800
do arc so I just do canvas top width

00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:56,899
divided by two and canvas height / -

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,240
just to Center it you give it the radius

00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:02,509
and then the start angle and then math

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,980
dot PI is half a circle and the same

00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,509
thing it's the exact same thing you just

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,639
multiply it by two which is otherwise

00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:10,970
known as two pi it's math without pi

00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,670
times 2 and 1/4 with radians is just

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,990
divided by 2 so half circle with degrees

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,060
this is just using

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,240
formula that well not my formula but the

00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:23,750
formula I gave you so far degrees equals

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,850
180 and then radians equals two degrees

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,830
multiplied by math dot pi divided by 180

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,630
and as you can see I actually give it

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,029
the radians like I said before because

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,880
you give it the radians and that's half

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:38,660
circle a full circle you can see is 360

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,060
degrees and 1/4 of circles 90 degrees

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,770
and as you can see the circle it

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,740
actually starts going down instead of up

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:48,290
like you'd normally think which so this

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,720
is the classic coordinate system just a

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,980
little background on canvas and this is

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,140
what we've been taught like when I'm

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,089
graphing in school and I'm still in

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,240
school so I know that we still use this

00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:01,430
that the center of the page is zero zero

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,620
and then positive Y goes up positive

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,480
negative Y goes down positive X goes

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,459
right and then negative goes left well

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,050
the graphics coordinate system I think

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:12,200
it's graphics coordinate systems just

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:16,880
computers and canvas the top left is the

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:19,040
center so 0 0 and positive Y goes down

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,930
so it's kind of confusing sometimes at

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,420
first that the positive goes down and

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,310
then positive X is just still right but

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,260
it starts in the top left I was confused

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,060
at this because I'll start trying to

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,100
animate stuff but it was off my screen

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,770
and I didn't understand why and that's

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,320
why is because it's in the top left but

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,120
it's also backwards for the classic

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,370
angle system the classic angle system

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,920
which I was showing you positive degrees

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,320
goes up and negative goes down but as

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,750
you can see in my circle demo it

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,600
actually went down the circle started

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,950
going down because canvas angle system

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,430
goes positive goes down and then

00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:59,589
negative goes up all right so let's

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:03,260
start talking of how sine waves okay so

00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:05,660
this is how a sine function behaves as

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,640
you can see the PI the radians is on the

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,620
top graph and then the degrees is on the

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:14,000
bottom I just show them both you can

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:16,160
just visually see how a sine wave will

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,079
work into a circle and you can animate

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,930
it that way so you can see that pi is

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,480
half a circle and then 2 pi basically

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,060
equals it is a circle and then vice

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,880
versa so 360 degrees 180 degrees is half

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:32,120
a circle so I made a little example

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,310
which is what I was gonna show you some

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:41,420
code pen and this is what I was saying

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:42,650
beforehand if you can if you have my

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,040
slides up and you can see it better I

00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:48,860
don't clear it because it leaves a trace

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,810
and you can see here I the range is a

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,790
hundred so how far the sine wave goes

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,650
down and up which is otherwise known as

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,510
the amplitude if you're if you're

00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,430
technical with it I just call it range

00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,600
because I like the range it makes sense

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,150
to me

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,400
speed X is the how fast it goes right

00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,560
the sine wave starts animating and speed

00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,960
wise up and down so how fast it animates

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,390
up and down luckily we had

00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,900
requestanimationframe 60 frames per

00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,710
second talk by Jeremy so he you know you

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,870
now understand that

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,780
requestanimationframe is 60 frames per

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,090
second it tries to go that speed so we

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:26,570
begin the path we move it to wherever we

00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:28,460
want in this case just 0 for the x and y

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,160
is Center wise so we can have a centered

00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:35,750
and then in the requestanimationframe we

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:38,330
increment the X 2 plus equals to speed X

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:42,410
so that it always just keep moving and

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:44,510
then for the Y we set it to Center wide

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,820
that's just where our Y is so we could

00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,070
have done the past the old Y and then we

00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,650
had the math-science so that actually

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:54,170
will do the sine wave which I you can

00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,960
see in the last graph and we give it the

00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:00,130
angle which the angle is the radians

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:03,500
which I was showing you and our angle

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,180
you just increment it with the why the

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,280
speed wise so that it'll move up and

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,990
down as fast and then you multiply by

00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,480
the range to see if she goes up and down

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:16,640
and then the rest of these lines don't

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,800
matter can you even see the mouse but if

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,430
you can tell that if I change this right

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,600
here then it will change and that's what

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:30,050
I was talking about of the range

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,480
otherwise known as the amplitude in K so

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,220
now

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,320
we have sine waves let's actually

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,639
animate with sine waves so this time

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,820
we're actually going to clear the canvas

00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:41,130
instead of just leaving that trace we're

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,870
going to clear the canvas of course we

00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:46,470
use requestanimationframe with all our

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,820
animations like a game loop for you know

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,389
it's just a game loop and then we'll

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:54,510
just create a circle to animate with it

00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:56,970
because in a sine wave and so we'll give

00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,320
it an X and y and we'll loop it over so

00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,610
you can see it multiple times and then

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,690
we'll just give the ball a random size

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:06,060
so we can see it in action

00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,980
so here's the sine wave I didn't

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,170
actually make the canvas to adjust the

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,120
width and heigh of this but if you have

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,010
it pulled up you can see that it is

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,899
going in a sine wave and it's animating

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,899
that way it doesn't leave a trace

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:25,079
because we're clearing it and this might

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,459
be a little confusing well not this part

00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,040
this is just an object I just use an

00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:31,920
object I like to use objects to create

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,320
my balls and stuff but okay so this

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,339
might be a little confusing because I

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,649
have a set timeout and

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,209
requestanimationframe but because you're

00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:41,310
saying how you don't use both you either

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:43,709
use requestanimationframe or the set

00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,089
timeout but the reason why I'm using a

00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:48,000
set timeout is pretty ghetto I'm just

00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:50,519
pushing a ball into an array well I have

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,290
and then it'll just send a new one if I

00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,310
had to do this different I just have it

00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,199
so when it gets to the end of screen

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,230
just have a send another one or the same

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,459
one but that's why I just don't get

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,470
confused with the set time I'm just

00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,420
pushing it into array and in my

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,029
requestanimationframe this is where I

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:09,240
actually paint the otherwise known as

00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:12,000
pushing the ball and I just use a for

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,430
loop which the balls is right here so 25

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,959
balls it'll just send them in and the

00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,750
range is the amplitude otherwise known

00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:23,300
and they'll get random number function

00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:23,300
so you can see that later if you'd like

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,010
alright so now that we have sine waves

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:31,079
let's actually do some motion animate it

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,310
so those are pretty boring I know that

00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,040
everyone's probably thinking why would I

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:38,640
ever animate just with sine waves just

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,649
like a sine wave right well we can start

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,250
getting it to motion so what is velocity

00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:46,950
this is a math term physics I guess

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,740
and velocity is just in this basic term

00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,960
is something that moves but like I put

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,320
up their velocity is speed and

00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,210
directions so it it's it's a direction I

00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,620
bolded it because you need you have a

00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,500
speed and a direction that's what the

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,660
velocity term is velocity on X is just

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,130
the horizontal move in and velocity and

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,550
Y is just the vertical movement and I

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:11,400
bolded VX and V Y because when people

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:14,280
are programming they just write like dot

00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,900
VX or dot V Y so I remember when I was

00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,120
looking at canvas animations I didn't

00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,550
really understand I wanted to know what

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,800
the Ackermann acronym meant but I didn't

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,150
know where to find it and so when I

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,030
started studying canvas and reading

00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:30,870
books I found out it just means velocity

00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:32,160
on X so remember it has a direction and

00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,990
as you can see here if you have my

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,800
slides pop up that they do actually put

00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:40,710
that VX r dot V Y okay so velocity on

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,600
x-axis this is just basically a simple

00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,580
demo you already probably know what it's

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,970
going to do but the rectangle is just

00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:50,040
going to move on the x axis just

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:53,130
velocity on x axis that's all it is it's

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,920
just moving and I have it come back

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,830
around when it's done so this is the

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,180
logic this the fill wrecked it just it

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,920
looks confusing but really I'm just

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,040
trying to center in the page so that you

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,690
can it looks better and that's just my

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,730
boundary logic to send it back through

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,020
the if you'll see that a lot of my demos

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,780
like all of them because I like to see

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:16,200
it come back around but the key thing

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:20,250
here to notice is I have two variables I

00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,990
have an X so 0 and I have a VX which is

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:26,400
equal to 2 so basically the movement

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:28,830
speed of the rectangle on the x axis so

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,530
and then when you actually give it to it

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,060
you just give it X so when you give the

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,960
variable the X you just give it an X and

00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:39,870
then you X incrementally equal to the VX

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:44,160
so you add it to that and so that's the

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:46,470
X oh and I also just put this one in

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,270
there for velocity on Y axis on both

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:52,950
axes I mean sorry which is kind of

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,290
velocity on both axes I'll get into that

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,570
right after this slide but what it is

00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:59,340
just so yeah I can ease you into it X

00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,830
zero y equals zero so you set them both

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,830
to zero just first so you can see it and

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:08,130
I give it a speed of one pixel so I'm

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,410
both VX equals 1 v y equals 1 and then

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:14,700
my requestanimationframe I give the art

00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:19,200
the circle x and y and then I just add

00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:25,080
equal to the VX x and the y vy both ways

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:27,750
so it just moves that way ok so but we

00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,000
kind of cheated with the definition of

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,530
velocity because we have two different

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,180
speeds so they could be two different

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,010
speeds we could have but they're both 1

00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,860
in this demo but we have two different

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,200
speeds in two different directions so

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,820
what if we have a value for speed and an

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:47,340
angle for directions so say we want to

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:50,610
go 45 degrees and move it 1 pixel but

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,020
there isn't a VX or view eye anything

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,510
similar to that definition how would we

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,550
do that we just give it 45 degrees that

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,650
would be 45 that's how fast it actually

00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,570
be going so we're gonna have to do a

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:04,200
little bit of math again with math sign

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,850
of math cosine I bring in this is its

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,840
angular velocity but I bring in this

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:16,800
triangle so come back to geometers I

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:20,310
which is trigonometry and geometry so we

00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,760
have an angle and then math dot sine so

00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:26,010
I didn't explain this but sine is

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:32,220
opposite over hypotenuse and if you

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:35,220
don't know what that means I'm sorry but

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,760
I actually have a demo that I made

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:41,310
that's pretty good to help and cosine is

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,890
adjacent over hypotenuse to the angle of

00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:48,810
course okay so we're gonna have to get

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:52,440
back to math so we're gonna have to set

00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:54,180
an angle so the angles thirty two point

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,370
three whatever you want whatever angle

00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,470
this is why it's good because it's the

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,000
angle before we hand we couldn't just

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,610
give it an angle but now we can just

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,100
give us some specific angle and this is

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:08,070
in degrees so we put it do it in the to

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,230
the radians formula and now we set our

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,560
VX we have to give it to the VX not the

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,290
X last time we gave it

00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,030
the X which made it just do the sign

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,650
thing but now we're going to actually

00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,380
give it to a different variable which is

00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:23,320
VX so we're going to give it to VX and

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,750
say math or cosine give it the angle so

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,850
radians and then we multiply it by the

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,950
speed so whatever speed we want before

00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:32,830
it was ranged but let's just multiply it

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:36,340
by the speed this time and so cosine as

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:40,690
you can see was I said it's adjacent

00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:43,030
over hypotenuse and so Jason if you

00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:46,000
could see my pointer here and hypotenuse

00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:49,810
so that would be this one right here

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,680
which is X so I named it VX and then the

00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:57,340
V Y which is sine we give it the angle

00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,530
and then we multiply by the speed so I

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:03,250
bought this like $25 app to show you

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:07,990
this ruler and um I'm not kidding either

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:10,330
I haven't used this sense and I shook

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:13,030
the angle to negative 45 degrees because

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,040
like I said before the angle system is

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,660
backwards with canvas so I just said

00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,850
it's a negative angle or negative 45 so

00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:23,950
you could see it and this is the demo

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:26,680
right here that's 45 degrees and if you

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:31,060
don't believe me we can change this

00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:34,000
right here to 90 and we all know what 90

00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:37,510
degrees is up and down okay so now we

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,650
understand this we have a speed so we

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,290
have a different variable for speed this

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,900
time we have an x and a y so we just set

00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:48,580
it to zero in the top left corner and we

00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:50,050
have my earth we have the object that I

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,030
just create the ball with you don't have

00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,610
to do this I just do it so that I can

00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:57,670
have multiple balls in whatever multiple

00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,780
circles and so we clear the canvas so we

00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,570
can animate instead of just leaving

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,960
nasty green trace if you took that out

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:08,650
you would see okay this right here can

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,540
help you if you don't see it I'm sorry

00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,760
but you can pull it up on your laptop it

00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,930
shows you this the I just left it there

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,370
for the demo if you ever come back to

00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:20,920
the demo it'll show you which one's the

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:22,120
sine cosine Jason such okay so then we

00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,740
have the radians like I showed you

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,350
before the VX and V Y

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,450
we just do the same thing like always we

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:32,059
just plus or equal to it to the V X the

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,520
X and the y so it'll start moving this

00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:37,520
if statement is just so it's just

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:42,860
boundary logic basically so you can just

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:46,970
see a come loop around so we got a

00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:48,679
velocity what is acceleration so most

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,900
people think of acceleration as speeding

00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:55,100
up and speeding down and you wouldn't be

00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,540
wrong but it's also a value and the

00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,870
direction just like velocity it has a

00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:02,240
direction so velocity changes the

00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:03,950
position of an object so you have an x

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,590
and y it's just sitting there and then

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,090
you and then VX and V Y velocity will

00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,679
change the position of it so it'll start

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,980
moving but it's moving at a constant

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,840
speed acceleration changes its velocity

00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,800
so now we have three variables we have

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:21,110
an X of VX and an ax so now X is just

00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,510
zero just for basic and then we have a

00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,550
VX which will go to the X so these two

00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:29,510
so it'll start moving it constantly and

00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:31,460
then the ax is with the VX so it's a

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,960
value that you add to the velocity

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,870
property which I'll show you in this

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,559
demo so you can see here we have three

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:41,990
variables X is equal to 0 VX is equal to

00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:44,150
0 just for simple so it's not moving at

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,740
all it's just there but now we have an

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:51,920
ax acceleration on X and we set it to

00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:55,070
0.04 and then we just do this so we add

00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,370
X equal to the VX and then V X to the ax

00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:00,980
which I was saying for and you will see

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:04,370
this will start to speed up pretty

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:06,440
rapidly so that's acceleration because

00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,900
it's going to the on the VX instead of

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,460
the X they were both 0 but then the VX

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,429
was adding to that now it's just going

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:16,970
crazy and that's my boundary logic right

00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:19,790
there and now so now we have it on the y

00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,500
axis which is literally the exact same

00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,790
thing just change the variables so I

00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,830
didn't even have to have this in there

00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,570
but just so that I can show you it is

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,130
the exact same thing and if you wanted

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:33,020
to look at the code I just plug it in

00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:37,280
for Y in the arc so the circle okay so

00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:38,180
now angular acceleration this is just

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,390
like before

00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,830
so we I just set the X y VX and V Y they

00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,080
all just are 0 so it's just sitting

00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,360
there so you aren't too confused but

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,740
normally you have VX and V Y just moving

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,870
and then you add the acceleration to

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,640
that but for now let's just set it to 0

00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,640
it'll start moving right off the bat

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,000
anyways so we have our angle so 45

00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,830
degrees and our force I use the word

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,430
force for the variable just so I sound

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:07,550
smart I don't know you could just name

00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:11,060
whatever and the speed acceleration

00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:13,970
speed okay so then we go and this is

00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:17,120
actually going at 45 degrees just like

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,970
before if I change getting and see where

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,310
that okay I can't even see from here if

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:28,520
I add it to 90 degrees you will see that

00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:32,320
it will whatever reloads did I lose

00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:39,260
Wi-Fi I don't know if I lost Wi-Fi but

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:41,150
let's pull this out this time now it's a

00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,530
little different so we have a radians we

00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,090
plug it in the angle just so we can

00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:47,170
switch the degrees up so we can do some

00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:49,670
random degree if we want 32 degrees and

00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,710
so now we have an x and y so there's

00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,570
zero right now we have a VX and V Y and

00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:56,960
they're both zero but the VX and V Y

00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:59,270
both are adding equal to the ax and a Y

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,980
so that the and this time instead of

00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,820
giving the math of sine and math or

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:07,370
cosine on the velocity we give it to the

00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,780
acceleration which will make it do

00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,530
basically the same things velocity but

00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,220
this time we're adding it to the

00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,140
velocity the acceleration to the

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:19,370
velocity which will make it do that

00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:21,560
because we have and it goes crazy so now

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,720
that we have we know acceleration and we

00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,120
know velocity let's add them together on

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,700
both axes so we have acceleration

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:32,500
velocity and we're adding it on x and y

00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:36,290
on all of them so at this little demo

00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:39,920
you can control it with your keypad if

00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:42,020
you have my slides open and basically so

00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,810
if I just move this around you can see

00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:47,870
if the scroll bars and it'll just loop

00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:51,010
around and the ads acceleration okay so

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:51,010
how do we actually do this

00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:58,820
okay so we set our variables all to zero

00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:00,680
even the ax and a y the ax and the a Y

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,320
have to change because you're adding

00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,700
actually force so they're all at zero

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,770
they're just it's in the sin of the page

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,960
the x and y are Center x center Y just

00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:13,130
so it's in the center looks good instead

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,630
of the top left and reactiveness so when

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,670
you actually touch it how much are you

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,220
going to add to the acceleration

00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,840
otherwise the velocity so it's just zero

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,750
point one is pretty good it's even a

00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,040
little quick I just do my object again

00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,770
for the ball you can do whatever you

00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,150
want you can actually manually do it

00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,620
instead of just doing that instead of

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,440
just creating a new one but I like

00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,720
creating any one okay so now we add an

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,000
event listener on the document so on key

00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,820
down I just have a switch of all the

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,720
up-down left-right Konami code all right

00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,940
now can okay and then we just add it so

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,770
if we're going to go up then we're going

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,660
to - reactiveness and then if we're

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:53,180
gonna go down vice versa to the left

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:57,290
right and to the a y so we set it to the

00:27:53,180 --> 00:28:01,460
a x and a y so that you set it to the

00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:04,130
velocity but you'll see but the thing is

00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,470
is if it will just keep going so start

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,150
going quicker and quicker but we have to

00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,640
when we let go we're gonna have to set

00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:12,890
the ax and ay Y to zero back to zero and

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,090
just keep the velocity keep moving

00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,700
that's why we have three variables and

00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:19,910
this circle has been going the same

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,460
constant speed since ly last touched it

00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:24,410
because it's on the velocity you could

00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,650
technically add like gravity or whatever

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:29,660
you want to slow it down but it's just

00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,670
going the same speed and the ax and the

00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:36,290
a Y are the only one that determine how

00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:38,300
fast and where it goes and such so we

00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:41,840
clear it we have some boundary logic and

00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,840
we do the same things as before and we

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:51,740
get this sweet velocity acceleration

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:53,860
demo so thank you

00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,860
if

00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,130
