they're all under mobile phones so

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:42,750
accelerated mobile pages was just

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:46,260

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,480
superfast mobile pages it's open source

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,989
on github under the apache license and

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,660
it's basically a restricted subset of

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,280
HTML with rules it's developed within

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,269
google but it's on an open government

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:04,769
model so you know and this video will

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:09,600
not run oh it will all right we have 50

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:11,220
seconds and this thing will run oh you

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,950
if you how many of you have seen the amp

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,340
demo how many peeps in Google how many

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,570
people have heard of google out okay so

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,549
i can make some stuff up because very

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,650
few people know about it alright so this

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:24,160
is an app launch partners so we have

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,720
linked in

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,540
pinterest so if you use their app and

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,530
you click on a link that has amp HTML

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,910
it'll load that page very quickly and

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,340
they started with new site since these

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,840
are all slow sites and you know they

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,110
want people to access their content fast

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,450
but anybody can use amp nowadays so how

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,220
does it work o.o basically you take

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,400
normal HTML you remove everything

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:53,500
including javascript and you replace it

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:56,890
oops you replace it with amp special

00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:01,720
tags and once the special tags your site

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:05,410
loads way faster this is the demo looks

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:09,400
like this you go check it out and sites

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:11,380
load instantly right that's not for

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,450
everybody it's not for you know all the

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,800
awesome sites we make but for content

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:19,620
sites yeah why not it's not you know

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,100
might not be for everybody its

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:27,490
production but you know thank you use it

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,200
with caution and you can get started if

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,600
you want WordPress also you can get

00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,060
started right away and you can check out

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,710
these URLs to test it out on see the

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,260
difference basically okay here for

difference one point five megabytes the

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,480
app site loads in half a second when you

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,669
when you used amp compared to four

00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,320
seconds loads in half a second and that

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,020
makes a difference on mobile desktop we

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,440
