Title: Christian Heilmann: Overboard.js - JSConf.Asia 2015
Publication date: 2015-12-12
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2015
Description: 
	There's a daily cool new thing in the world of JavaScript you need to know or you will fall behind. Or at least that is how it feels like. Don't feel bad, don't get frustrated.
JavaScript is a hot topic and we love to build with it. It gives us control, it allows us to do things our way instead of waiting for browsers and it makes us more efficient. However, there is a flipside to that. It is almost impossible to keep up with the speed of innovation. In this talk you'll learn how we can use JavaScript, how to avoid over-using it and what you can do to play on the bleeding edge without feeling lost.
Chris has dedicated a lot of his time making the web better. Originally coming from a radio journalism background, he built his first web site from scratch around 1997 and spent the following years working on lots of large, international web sites. He then spent a few years in Yahoo building products and explaining and training people including Yahoo Answers, Search, Local and Maps. He then worked at Mozilla moving HTML5 support forward and advocating Firefox OS as an open alternative to closed mobile systems. Chris wrote two and contributed to eight books on web development and wrote many articles and hundreds of blog posts for Ajaxian, Smashing Magazine, Yahoo, Mozilla, ScriptJunkie and many more. He also wrote the Developer Evangelism Handbook in use in many companies to coach evangelists. He is currently working with the Microsoft Edge team as a Program Manager for Developer Outreach.

hello okay microphone works okay I have

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,640
a lot of slides we don't have much time

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,920
i'm also very very tired because i came

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,750
just yesterday and i slept like four

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,060
hours and some hours on the plane and

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,189
you know plane flights it's never good

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,189
sleeping you just drool on yourself and

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,080
you just type that there in the water

00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:34,170
talking about the water i want to talk

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,700
about today a bit about how we are we go

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,500
a bit overboard with the javascript that

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,480
we're doing right now because javascript

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,059
has been such a massive success the last

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,950
few months that we all get very excited

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,649
about it and I find it kind of

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,559
frustrating how people feel out of sync

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,449
or feel not appropriate anymore and how

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,789
the JavaScript community becomes a bit

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,620
arrogant and aggressive and I think it's

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,320
not necessary that we do that to

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,000
ourselves or to other people as we've

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,890
been asked to introduce ourselves a bit

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,449
to the camera and the recordings I'm

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,250
going to talk a bit about myself but

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,619
it's not gonna be the normal like hi I'm

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,270
here and I'm sorry it does it mean but I

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,330
want to give you a bit of a frame of

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,890
mind why I came to be Who I am here and

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,220
why I think that we're going a bit

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,990
overboard so I'm Chris Hyman I'm at code

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,640
poet on Twitter so if you don't have

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,650
enough hedgehogs fluffy animals and

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,200
JavaScript information in your world you

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,119
can always follow me there I think fifty

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,860
one thousand people do that right now so

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,600
don't be surprised if there's a lot of

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,579
answering and stuff going on and I don't

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,130
know why people do it but it seems some

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,630
of the things I do are interesting I

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,290
live in London England and this is what

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,150
my street looked like last week

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,979
basically grim and terrible that's why

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,450
we do so many things with computers most

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,860
of time it rained since when people

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,750
start drinking and fighting that's why

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,540
you stay inside and write JavaScript

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,939
instead it was also seven degrees and

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,770
now it's like 24 here or something and

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,719
I'm just going in between I'm going to

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,159
Thailand after this and Sydney because

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,520
they're going to try out what happens

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,899
when you put redheads in the Sun and

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,549
then I hope back to England and go to

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,990
Finland after this so if I not get a

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,709
cold it's going to be a very big

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,900
surprise I've been a developer right to

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,860
present a trainer and manager and all of

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,740
this is

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,600
cause I know JavaScript and I think it's

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,160
very important that all of us here stop

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,230
thinking about that sooner or later

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,780
you're gonna be as old as me your hair

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,340
is gonna fall out you're gonna not have

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,900
fun in life any longer and you're going

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,480
to think about your long-term plan of

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,460
what you're doing so thinking about I'm

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,050
the best engineer on this planet and I'm

00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,050
going to do that for the next 50 years

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,090
is not a good plan but as we build a

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,670
community around our technologies and as

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,800
we build as we work in a medium which is

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,709
the internet and we don't work just in a

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,680
software platform we have a chance to be

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:51,360
all these kind of people so in 2004 I

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,820
wrote this unobtrusive JavaScript

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,640
tutorial how to write JavaScript that is

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:59,370
not in the way of your end users in 2006

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,739
i wrote my first book i've i think it

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,480
published or written in eight books so

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,910
far or something like that and thousands

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,270
of articles basically because when i

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,160
write things down i remember them my my

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,050
blog started as a scratch pad for my

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,700
ideas because i wanted to remember them

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,530
which is very very annoying if forget

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,200
something and i go to google and i find

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,000
my own blog is the first result because

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,390
i just realized i get forgetful but this

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,090
is what we all do so i worked in several

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,620
companies and large corporations and i

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,380
work with javascript in all these

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,440
corporations and did things to scale and

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,090
did things to two different audiences to

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,310
different markets and i found out that

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,590
way that javascript is a very very cool

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,360
and versatile thing I worked for Yahoo

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,160
and I worked on the way I library i

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,290
worked on your home apps i worked on

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,060
yahoo answers and there you hear things

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,830
like oh we got three thousand people a

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,870
second what do we do about this in terms

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,019
of architecture be like okay let's try

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,239
that out then I worked for firefox and i

00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,580
worked on firefox OS which was very very

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,340
low level devices that were running an

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,290
operating system written in HTML 5 for a

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,630
market that is not in the Silicon Valley

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,489
and it is not rich kids and now i'm

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,840
working for microsoft and work on a new

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,910
edge browser because I basically

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,790
realized that internet explorer is the

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,680
reason for all of our unhappiness and I

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,299
should be in the company that built that

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,419
thing and replace it with something good

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,490
and that's what we did right now always

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,440
go for the source don't go for fighting

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,450
symptoms find out if you if you're sick

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,170
find out what made it happen not take

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,270
painkillers

00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,830
and hope it's going away so that's what

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,620
I did with Microsoft I'm very happy

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,660
about that and I use JavaScript in many

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,580
many different environments altering

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,780
websites and enhancing them with GS of

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,550
course the first thing that's why

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,130
javascript came around and that's why

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,020
javascript was used and I think it's

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,880
very important to realize that enhancing

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,980
them with jas is a big big thing here

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,410
because websites are more than a

00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:56,670
JavaScript construct websites or HTML

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:59,070
CSS images writing accessibility UX

00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,290
these are things that are publications

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,330
on the web and the web is an undefined

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,190
environment I cannot control anything

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,470
that our end users are doing so if it

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,690
runs fast on my machine well done if you

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,130
your only user that's great but think

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,220
about the people who are out there as

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,570
well we also had scripting and extending

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,280
applications that started with

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,350
illustrator I wrote JavaScript an

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,630
illustrator that was possible in 99 and

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,130
then home side was my big editor back

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,600
then it was written in jscript which

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,510
raised the terrible thing that should

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,700
never happen but did then Visual Studio

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,160
code for example now came out yesterday

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,990
as open source Adam is another travel

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,690
script editor that is written in

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,490
JavaScript with node and sublime text

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,040
has all kind of extensions that you can

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,080
write with it as well so we wrote in

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,820
environments like applications before

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,110
and for the web and these are two

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,480
different environments and two different

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,330
rules and two different best practices

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,590
apply to those and authoring reusable

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,470
widgets for people who don't know

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,510
JavaScript I mean later on this became

00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,760
jQuery plugins but before that we had

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,590
like d HTML drop-down menus in these

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,180
wonderful things like when you got like

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,440
six on a pound for 40 lines of

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,350
JavaScript that when you look at them

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,480
now you want to kill yourself working on

00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,420
libraries and frameworks on Yui on

00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,400
jQuery on dojo on all these things that

00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,080
came and went when I wrote for a Jackson

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,810
as a blogger at one time there were 400

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,370
12 different Dom libraries that all made

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,900
Ajax easy now we have was like 15,000 no

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,090
180,000 NPM modules that make everything

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,460
easy as well it might be a different

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,020
world that we're living in right now but

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,720
also we ride a lot of code that other

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,760
people will never use working on

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,410
browsers and JavaScript engines gave me

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,780
a lot of insight how javascript is

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,639
actually going into the computer how

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,680
it's turned into bytecode what the

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,659
browser does to us and what we do

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,310
terrible things to the JavaScript engine

00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:51,060
and then blame the browser makers that

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,800
they write kara crab code and working on

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,479
server side JavaScript using no chest

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,099
this is a really really great thing that

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,439
we can now write a server with a few

00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:00,240
lines of code and we can host the thing

00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,849
in the language that we're done before I

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,889
moved most of my PHP work to note

00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:06,689
because it's just easier for me to do

00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:09,060
nowadays although it's damn easy to get

00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:12,090
a PHP server not as easy to get a node

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,069
server going and designing a P is for JS

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,250
consumption as well when i worked on

00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:20,759
yahoo yql or on pipes and I help people

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,020
like encoding calm as fortify and all

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,879
those people that want to talk to

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,789
JavaScript developers how do you define

00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,830
an API for JavaScript developers all of

00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:30,659
that taught me that javascript is a

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,419
versatile creative and easy-to-learn

00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:36,180
pick and mix environment it is basically

00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,129
it's it's a sweet shop it's a beautiful

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,710
thing because you can use that language

00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:43,139
for almost anything and when you use it

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,479
you apply it in a certain way you don't

00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,599
apply it in just one way to rule them

00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,639
all but we keep treating JavaScript like

00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:53,219
a one-size-fits-all environment that we

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,930
can control it works for me our our

00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,969
users should have the newest browser as

00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,379
well all of our users should actually

00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:00,990
have a faster computer because it's

00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,879
their fault that my code is slow and we

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,770
really like this kid we just scream and

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,870
shout at each other and we scream and

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,550
shout about everything that we use while

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,169
we are actually having incredibly good

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,419
hardware an incredibly good development

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:15,539
environments when I look at dev tools of

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:18,539
chrome dev tools of Firefox and soon dev

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:20,490
tools in edge I'm just amazed what we

00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,529
can do nowadays what kind of insight we

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,000
get and still we're saying like Otis is

00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:25,620
not as good as the other environments

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,750
although most of us never looked at the

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,610
other environments and just looked under

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,099
the hood just how horrible Android and

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,839
iOS is as well because it's software

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,940
it's written by humans it's written by

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,320
people like us who just clean other

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,000
things and then like look it's working

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,699
I'm not going to look at a name all and

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,800
I think lately we go overboard with Jess

00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:47,160
we just try to do everything with Jess

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,899
and we get terribly excited if if it

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,029
works and we get terribly disappointed

00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:54,029
if not everybody is with us on that on

00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:55,230
that same boat we're going full speed on

00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:58,140
innovation I'm not going to

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,960
go into the details but if you subscribe

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,240
to a co je s or you go to hack and use

00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,830
every day there's some new thing every

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,540
three months one of the large

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,950
corporations will have some great new

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,750
thing that will be the future of the

00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,760
internet and then half year later we

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,950
won't hear about it any longer and all

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,210
of these things are incredibly important

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,870
things they're incredibly intelligent

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:21,450
things very well architected things but

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,790
many of them are also like is it really

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,650
necessary that we all play on the

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,080
bleeding edge because the bleeding edge

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,390
is about this wide we would fall over if

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,660
all of us played there and it's bleeding

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,280
so it's hurtful so the code that is on

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,010
the bleeding edge should not hurt our

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,530
users but should move us forward so we

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,330
should find time and space to use it and

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,140
not just say this is the bleeding edge

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,610
and it's now they've now the reality

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,950
it's a vicious innovation cycle

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,320
developers don't use features until

00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,270
browser support them and browsers don't

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,580
add new features unless there's demand

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,550
and use in the wild this is how every

00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,760
browser maker prioritizes new features

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,650
do people really use these things oh no

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,080
they don't so we don't have to have them

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,300
and it's a very important thing because

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,640
browsers are also software developers

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,620
it's a finite number of people even the

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,930
open-source ones have a finite number of

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,090
people working on those things so that

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:21,990
cool new feature that you really want is

00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,820
it necessary is somebody using it no we

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,740
all know that app cache is broken it's a

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,090
terrible thing Jake Archibald said it's

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,490
the end of the world and it killed

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,320
kittens and all kind of stuff and then

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,940
when you when you send out the ping

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,110
crawler ping is a search engine you

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,440
could go before that if you don't know

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,540
it and we look at the mag Adam to

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,480
standards inside Firefox we found out

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,460
that hardly anybody including

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,680
applications used in app cache people

00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,930
just saw it's broken and never tried it

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,920
out so at the same time we just had this

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,780
like oh we're not going to touch it

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,040
because it's so terribly broken I tested

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,230
it myself no you didn't you're lying

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,100
because it otherwise it would be on the

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,360
web somewhere and developers just want

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,890
the new shiny things rather than

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,320
demanding the things that are broken

00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:07,050
form elements are still terrible across

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,059
browsers you cannot start a select boxes

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,829
you cannot a datepicker Lou

00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,349
doesn't work on all browsers the same

00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:15,239
way and it that's fine they can work

00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:16,739
differently but it should work and not

00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:18,509
just be something that is in the browser

00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:20,879
because it's there we should demand more

00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:22,559
that the basics of HTML 5 is working

00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,559
before we're going for the next feature

00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,929
out there and we force rules on to

00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,789
ourselves that might be overkill I love

00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,559
this blog post the other day that's the

00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,749
checklist for a new open source

00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:37,979
JavaScript project please follow these

00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:40,139
steps and you know if I were now

00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:41,999
somebody coming from University I never

00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,439
been to university or somebody coming

00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,789
from school and saying like I want to

00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:46,349
learn something about that computer is

00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:48,809
thingy where all the jobs are and people

00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:51,449
get money and I get this instead of like

00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:53,699
here's the SDK of iOS I probably would

00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:55,979
go for iOS as well because that is too

00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:57,359
much all of these things are important

00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:59,669
all of these things are well architected

00:11:57,359 --> 00:12:00,899
all of these things are beautiful but

00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:02,849
putting them all together is just

00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,199
shocking new people and stopping them

00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:07,199
from getting into the market because

00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:09,209
this is not inviting this is just

00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:11,339
telling people here is how it has to be

00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:12,659
done and this is why i left germany and

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,249
move to England because in Germany

00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:18,149
everything is this is how it has to be

00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:19,979
done we live in a high fueled

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:21,659
environment we don't even want to

00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:23,849
deliver things anymore we just get

00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,559
excited about ourselves the the tech

00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:27,419
press has nothing else to write about

00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,699
but javascript and developers at the

00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:32,069
moment almost every tech company sees

00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:33,929
developers as the audience that we try

00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:36,239
to get to cause the audience for our

00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:38,669
users of our products that stuff that

00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:40,499
happens magically or so we hope but

00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:42,509
developers are the most expensive thing

00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:44,549
to get right now and hardest thing to

00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:46,709
get as well but the only market where

00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:48,659
there's more jobs than people for now

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:50,729
there will be a crash there was a crash

00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:52,649
in 1999 when I we lived in when I lived

00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,359
in Los Angeles that it will come again

00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:55,679
it cannot be retained so I'm like 18

00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:57,389
billion dollars for a company that

00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,709
allows people to send emojis to each

00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:02,549
other there's something going wrong

00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:05,309
there but right now we are could we are

00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:07,349
basically up in demand and people really

00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:09,179
really want us and it's all about hype

00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:10,649
it's a set of saying like okay I want to

00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,599
build something beautiful for you that's

00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:14,309
maintainable I'm like I can make it a

00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:16,949
coolest newest thing using these 12

00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:18,539
frameworks like writing that you know

00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:20,909
about your ex that you know how to make

00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:22,860
an accessible web app on your on your CV

00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:24,720
will get you much less than saying

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,550
like I know the framework so in so

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,350
that's right now in half the demand I

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,120
love these linkedin invites when people

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,000
ask for three year experience or five

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,830
year old libraries but that's a sign of

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,050
that hype that we're having right now

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,330
which is trying to impress each other

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,460
and the prayer and the tech press is

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,500
just making everything amazing you know

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,660
everything is like just a new library

00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,100
dust is it's only so small it's so

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,810
amazing it does this and this and this

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:54,150
and this don't use in production so what

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,620
do we use it for like impressing each

00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,630
other playing with it at home this is

00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,010
not really what we're going to do we're

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,600
impressing one another rather than

00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,570
building things for the outside world

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,460
and this is most like most of time

00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,980
people like to quote Moore's law and

00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,660
this is a bit paraphrased is normally

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,820
about semiconductors and pricing of

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,890
those computers get faster better

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,080
cheaper and more available every two

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,400
years and I hear that every time when

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,960
something is slow yeah but the new

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,720
iphone is coming out it will be fine

00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,280
then you know because my javascript

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,780
library is probably the thing you want

00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,630
to buy an eight-hundred-dollar phone for

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,100
so it actually works faster and

00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,780
everybody just expects continuously

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,080
people to upgrade their computers

00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,790
because we do we work with amazing

00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,440
hardware most of the companies are not

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,990
flinching anymore when I say like I want

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,420
to get a macbook pro I got a macbook pro

00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,750
for Microsoft when a joint them as my

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,400
computer and assembly to test the test

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,380
things out because they know not

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,120
everybody uses windows in the developer

00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,340
world and I used to Mac before so I

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,320
wanted to stay with that as well we have

00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,900
phones that are amazing we get test

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,650
phones we get to try things out we also

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,030
work with amazing connectivity like

00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,370
compared to the outside world there and

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:07,500
I staying in hotels a lot I know how bad

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,140
connectivity can be and living in

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,640
England at times as well we work with

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,950
great connectivity and what does that

00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,140
blink anyways we work with great

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,610
connectivity in an environment where we

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,800
don't even know what elf line is anymore

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,560
and most people out there that don't

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,440
have that we get paid well for a job

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,570
that we like to do and start talking to

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,400
people outside our market if they get

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,780
paid for the job that they like to do or

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,790
if they have more fun in their free time

00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,710
and it just go to work to make money and

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,270
that's something we should never forget

00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,430
how lucky

00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,680
we are how amazingly lucky we are that

00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:44,070
we get the freedoms that we have the

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,990
problem is though that we assume all the

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,220
things that we have other people have as

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,250
well we work with these beautiful

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,650
browsers and all of them are amazing yes

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,320
even the ones on older androids yes even

00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:59,100
Safari yes even know Internet Explorer

00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,620
as dead edge is great all these browsers

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,810
have come with amazing tools and all

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,360
these browsers have at least a baseline

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,430
that we can now work against and when I

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,780
started as a web developer that baseline

00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,700
wasn't there that's what we fought for

00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:15,360
this is what the web standards movement

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:18,600
was about that browsers follow standards

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,790
and compete on the on UX and compete on

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,620
the features that are for end-users and

00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:26,430
not on the engine that drives those

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,170
browsers when we talk about Moore's law

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,060
we have to talk about mais law which is

00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,770
again paraphrase but it says software

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,480
efficiency halves every 18 month

00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,760
compensating for moves Moore's law

00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,260
meaning the longer you maintain a piece

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,410
of software the bigger it gets in the

00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:42,030
slower it gets and we all been there I

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,890
love that it's two years for software

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,930
for hardware to get faster an 18 month

00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:49,020
for software to get slower so some will

00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:50,700
be losing six months all the time so in

00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,220
essence we move fast and we run in

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,350
circles because we have good stuff and

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,270
we put more things in and then we wait

00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,340
until the hardware catches up again and

00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,990
then we write more stuff again I talked

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,850
earlier to somebody outside i noted with

00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,490
hard drives you know you upgrade your

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,690
hard drive from 100 gig to 250 cake and

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,220
then like oh that's going to last me for

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,650
the next three years four weeks later

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,870
there's like 10 gig left and you're like

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,520
what did i do you have 6000 NPM modules

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,010
thousand eighty resolution movies

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,260
instead of CM 920 resolution which is

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,120
with digital hoarders we love to fill

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,400
things up because we might need it later

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,200
on the same way in our products we use

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,300
all the things that in the future our

00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,920
users might want to have rather than

00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,410
building something simple and making it

00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:35,130
after feedback from the users making it

00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:37,110
better the web is in a sorry sorry state

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,290
and that is really annoying me because

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,000
the behb the web made my career I don't

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,280
have a job education I didn't finish

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,750
university without the web but would be

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,480
probably I don't know what I were doing

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,270
dancing at cafes or something

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,240
the median web page time to interact is

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:57,000
5.5 seconds and fully loads in just over

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,770
15 seconds and that was a there was an

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,780
analysis / web performance daily had

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,520
been done I've been done there the

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,179
median web page is to megabyte in size

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,559
and contains 170 resources it is if it

00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,900
is if like we didn't have any

00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,850
performance information or training or

00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,040
tools and browsers for years and years

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,390
who builds this stuff it cannot be us

00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,730
because we learn all these cool things

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,700
here right must be some idiot that does

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,590
it differently but it's us it really is

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,840
over time because we move on to the next

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,580
library that we try out and we move on

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,710
to the next project that we want to have

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,480
and we believe companies when the

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,919
software becomes unmaintained well we

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,809
don't want to keep it any longer and

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,280
then instead of fixing it when we go to

00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,049
a new job we just show them the new

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,890
framework that we came with that will

00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:42,750
make everything better again right

00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,429
waiting isn't fun it's not fun to look

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,620
five seconds on your phone people don't

00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:48,840
do it they basically after two seconds

00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,340
on the phone we have much less patience

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,169
than we have on the desktop on a desktop

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,970
you got 12 tabs open you go to the other

00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:55,410
tab you look at fluffy kittens and you

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,960
come back to the other one that loaded

00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,179
on the phone you like I'm gonna kill you

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,190
or like is it come disconnected again

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,630
the amount of times i call my isp that

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,970
something is wrong where it realities

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,340
was just a website slow yeah well they

00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,140
deserved it it's especially annoying

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,210
when it costs you i just arrived

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,549
yesterday and three my provider in

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,770
England says it's a max of two pound of

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:19,740
minimum to call one point 25 to receive

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:22,230
a call six pound per megabyte to use the

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,750
web and email this means the average

00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,750
website is the same as the same price as

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,669
a ticket for the cinema so I really hope

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,860
that your website is entertaining enough

00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,540
that I don't watch Spectre or something

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:38,429
instead of watching your website for 12

00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:41,010
pound how does this happen what's going

00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:43,919
on here how do we fill up that web why

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,650
is that happening all the time I think

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,049
it's because we keep projecting we

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,390
attack the cheapest remember we're

00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:53,910
technically proficient we know our stuff

00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,530
about computers we're being we have

00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,240
interest in change in upgrades a new

00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,830
browser comes out we download that thing

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,250
and your operating system comes out

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:06,210
unless it's OS X we uploaded immediately

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,740
I don't know is it same with you like as

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,270
soon as that the news is out the other

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,030
one becomes really unstable I don't know

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,710
what they're doing but fair enough we

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,870
have interest in spending money on the

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,700
web and for web services because we're

00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,560
actually we live off the web so we also

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,180
spend money on there and we expect our

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,770
audience to do the same thing they

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,630
always have the newest computers they

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,640
always upgrade the operating system they

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,470
make every security patch out there and

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,240
that's basically why we have such a

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,390
wonderful symbiosis with our users and

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,880
we never hate them the reality is kind

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,740
of different first of all the last thing

00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,990
the interest in spending money on the

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:43,200
web for web services doesn't apply to us

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,700
because we want everything for free we

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,340
all have ad blockers installed because

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,750
we're not stupid you know the other

00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,840
people are the ones that click on ads

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,640
you know like why would I do that I love

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,640
that Adblock Plus has been bought by

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,260
somebody and nobody knows who and that's

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,150
that was like four months ago it could

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,640
be the Mafia it could be the Triads it

00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,960
could be NSA or worse the American

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,430
government anybody could have bought

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,530
these things and that's on all of our

00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,170
computers and spies on us because we

00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:12,840
don't want to see ads I think it's time

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:14,520
for a reality check this is us in the

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,870
middle of it we don't spend money but

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,490
we're technically proficient we're

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,640
interested in change we upgrade all the

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,650
time we work for an assumed audience

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,120
that actually spend money on the stuff

00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,500
that we do and keep upgrading their

00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,320
computers all the time and know what a

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,730
computer is and know that a database

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,340
error on the page is not their problem

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,590
but our problem in reality our audience

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,320
is more or less there because it's a

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,090
numbers game it's the people the people

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,710
that we never see are the people that

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,390
click on ads the people that we never

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,010
see are the ones that download a new

00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,720
game where you put two colors and

00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,400
colorful fluffy things together that

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,010
make a ping sound that cost you twelve

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,590
dollars those are the people that pay

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,000
for the web and it's not i'm not saying

00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,970
that they're not that they're stupid you

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,650
just don't care and even more so they

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,750
don't care nowadays anymore because

00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,630
internet and computers has become

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,310
plumbing and water it's become a thing

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,680
that's just their people don't know what

00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:10,200
offline is or they don't know what a

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,000
computer but what a browser is they just

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,100
click on the thing and go somewhere on

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,590
the mobile phone the browsers to last

00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,640
app did you open when you

00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:22,580
new board of all the other ones the next

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,960
users though are not those who complain

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,429
that the web is not as good as native

00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,289
apps Bruce Lawson at state of the

00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:29,570
browser and some other conferences gave

00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:31,669
this great talk ensuring a performant

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,010
web for the next billion people where he

00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:35,929
shows you numbers about where the growth

00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,970
is where the next users are the next

00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:39,860
real billion of you billion people are

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:44,029
and it's actually in your neighborhood

00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,409
here like Indonesia India Africa these

00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,000
are the markets that are coming right

00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:48,740
now and these are not the board people

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,419
these are the people what the internet

00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,130
access to the Internet makes a

00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:53,809
difference to them where the Internet is

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,029
a teacher where the internet is an

00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:57,710
education tool where the internet means

00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:00,020
that they will have a business or don't

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,669
have a business and this is something we

00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,830
should think about when we start putting

00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:05,929
all the cool new technologies into our

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,460
products because we like to because

00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:09,649
Moore's law stopped working when

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,809
hardware and when we hardwired hardware

00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:13,370
and software this is the phone that my

00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:15,049
hotel gives me here for free and for

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:18,049
some reason calls me mr. Batchelor I

00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:20,149
don't know why it's an android phone

00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:22,130
that has a sim card in here that I can

00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:24,770
use off in this great service thank you

00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,960
so much but this Android gave me like

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,970
flashbacks from a google i/o six years

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,220
ago or something because it's a really

00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,990
really old small device that never has

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,610
been upgraded because it cannot be

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,649
upgraded because it's too slow for a

00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:39,590
newer Android version and the browser in

00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:41,960
there is something that is like done by

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:44,000
fullmoon by two werewolves and an old

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,710
Fork of WebKit or something that it just

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,480
shouldn't be in use but this is the

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,340
browser and will stay the brita browser

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,990
of those till the end of time and

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,789
everybody who goes into that hotel would

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,620
get that browser and there's nothing we

00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:56,179
can do about that we can stand on our

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,350
ahead and scream that they should have 2

00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:59,120
News coolest thing because i want to

00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,649
have service workers but these phones

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,240
are out there and it will stay out there

00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:04,730
for quite a while because we hardwired

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,070
operating system and browser which is

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,980
too stupid idea to Microsoft in the 90s

00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,809
but now finally gave up as well as

00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,760
developers we are always asked to do the

00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:15,409
impossible that's our problem as well

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,659
because we're still so far removed from

00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:19,549
the people who pay us money or from the

00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:21,409
people who run the projects that we're

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:23,450
doing they always ask us things that we

00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:25,220
cannot do in which is too proud to tell

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,350
them that we can't do them we just say

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,299
okay yeah fair enough I can do that make

00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:32,210
it work the same in every browser

00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:33,950
that's pointless that's like saying make

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,929
your car drive the same speed under

00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,570
water doesn't analyze on the motorway a

00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:40,549
good website looks different and works

00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,350
different according to the environment

00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:43,970
that it's actually used in that's the

00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,460
power of the web that's the power we

00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,409
have over native environments make it

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,419
easy to maintain and we want to control

00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:52,159
everything it's like we want to have a

00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:53,960
CMS but we also want to control the

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,570
color of every different letter on in

00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,059
our logo please then what that's where

00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,679
it becomes complex again make sure that

00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:02,059
it's accessible I think there's a law we

00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,950
need to follow nobody cares about

00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:05,749
accessibility because of people they

00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,639
just don't want to get sued and that's a

00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:09,950
cynical argument but I've seen in far

00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,840
too often sadly enough don't spend too

00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:16,009
much time on it let's release it now and

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,720
fix it later that's the biggest life

00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:22,159
followed by I read the Terms and

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:24,049
Conditions fix it later never comes fix

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,149
it later means you put things on the web

00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:29,629
that you're embarrassed about and you

00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:31,279
will never get the chance to fix use

00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:33,049
this analytics code you have no clue

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,869
about we need to know how people use our

00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:38,480
products like great that your javascript

00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:40,690
is fast here's 12 Nana lytic speak ins

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,279
that really really slow down the thing

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,899
just find the right bricks and assemble

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,539
something great there's so many tools

00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:51,830
out there 150,000 mpm modules why do you

00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:54,730
even write code any longer right what

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,730
does this code do

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:05,260
it looks quite complex it looks quite

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:12,760
amazing it's minified of course that's a

00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:18,310
good thing any guess it's to follow me

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:20,140
on twitter button this is the code that

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,360
is on the Twitter website to copy and

00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,430
paste so it's progressively enhancing a

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,020
link so that's pretty cool but this is

00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,090
the co degenerates and this is not

00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,650
because Twitter hates users this is

00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,960
because Twitter needs to make this thing

00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:34,210
work in every environment possible and

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,680
just don't want to think about it and

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,440
put like lots of poly fields and all

00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,840
kind of things in there and this is just

00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,480
painful you know this is like if that's

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,520
where we are then we forgot to move the

00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,230
platform with us and we forgot to feed

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,710
back to browsers what we really really

00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:53,380
need the amazing tech of today is the

00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,330
rubbish of tomorrow and I say I see that

00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,490
a lot right now because working for

00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,800
microsoft and working on edge we have

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,750
this wonderful site scanning tool that

00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,400
one you put your website in and it shows

00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,530
you what you're doing wrong with your

00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,560
website that you're using WebKit only

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,900
CSS that using jQuery 12 times where

00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,600
four times would be enough that you're

00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,010
using a attached event that's not

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,630
necessary anymore of course

00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,270
addeventlistener works on every browser

00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,400
nowadays it's a really nice tool to make

00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,990
to show enterprises and show companies

00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,640
what they're doing wrong with their

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,110
website it's also on get up so if you

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,880
find a bug in it or you want to run it

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,190
run it behind your firewall as a lot of

00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,110
our clients are doing you can do that I

00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,180
think my favorite quote that I heard

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,890
from all the clients was a simple way to

00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,350
detect her older part of our massive

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,410
website is it's checking which version

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,690
of jQuery was used in that part of it

00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:45,340
it's like rings new tree trunk so they

00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,020
found like 16 different versions of

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,850
jQuery on death website because

00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,800
different departments build different

00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,480
parts of their website and didn't talk

00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,630
to each other and didn't point to some

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,340
CDN hosted a jQuery that could be that

00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:59,440
could be cached and could be evergreen

00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,880
but everybody just bundled it in and and

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,350
threw it in there because nobody sees

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,240
that right we break the web for the sake

00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,070
of developer convenience this is the

00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,900
experience that the web gives me a lot

00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,370
like waiting for randoms

00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,660
off and when there was a javascript

00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,520
error in the background and they don't

00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,530
have an event handler of the error case

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,720
this is this is forever and ever and

00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,160
until I reload the page and thought it

00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,380
was my browser or something like that

00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,380
how many tutorials do you see where it's

00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:28,030
only the success case the error case is

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,880
the most important thing this is where

00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:33,670
you piss people off you make it as poss

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,890
never blame the user for something like

00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,020
that never let them wait endlessly show

00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,600
them like something went wrong your data

00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,610
is safe we're trying again it's our

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,290
fault sorry for this this is the only

00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,940
thing that you can do here but we always

00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:49,150
get like well they will reload it don't

00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:53,980
worry about that there's a great read

00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:56,920
and talk video by Paul by what's his

00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:00,160
name again Paul Lewis from google it was

00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,660
at full frontal last week and the post

00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,760
was like three days ago it's the cost of

00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,500
frameworks and it's all about ergonomics

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,270
versus user needs and i found that

00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,800
exciting to talk to him about that

00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,360
because i had these things before he

00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,060
collect a lot of data about these

00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,970
problems so one thing he looked at is

00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:17,950
that everybody uses a virtualization and

00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,140
uses a framework because the dome is

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,420
slow but tom is terrible we need a

00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,550
jquery course Adam was impossible to use

00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,440
and reading and writing from your HTML

00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,000
all the time is slowing things down in

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,530
the reactor documentation it says the

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,420
bottleneck is almost always the Dom

00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,910
mutation and not the JavaScript

00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,640
execution so Paul Lewis said like okay

00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,900
let's let's throw that to a test and see

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,120
what's coming out there so you build

00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,820
this website using angular and using

00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,340
react that just loads pictures from

00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,080
twitter from flickr and each of these

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,460
pictures like five dom elements because

00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,680
that's the documentation of the ority

00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,260
description stand the link and then he

00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,230
started looking a started a timer when

00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,240
the page loads until the framework kicks

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,880
in and then he finishes the timer and

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,560
then it starts writing out the HTML and

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,180
starting to position the pictures and

00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,190
stuff and then the second time of

00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,440
finishes and what he found out what's

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,080
really interesting that the more

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,050
pictures you have the longer of course

00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,780
it takes we all know that more HTML not

00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:19,240
a good idea but what he found is that

00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,760
the the rendering and the dom

00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,700
manipulation stayed more or less the

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,340
same whereas the javascript execution

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,780
framework that reads all these things

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,580
and then turns them into virtualized

00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,220
Stallman writes them out there it's

00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,290
becoming bigger and bigger like 1.5

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,650
seconds at the end of it when it came to

00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:41,010
like 100 1,000,000 dot no 1500 pictures

00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:44,050
on a 50,000 picture something like that

00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:46,300
anyways he realized that the Dom

00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:48,940
manipulation is slow but it stays the

00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,530
same whereas the JavaScript execution if

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,390
you do clever things to your things

00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,280
before you render them out becomes

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,410
bigger and bigger because the objects

00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,870
internally take more memory it takes

00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:01,210
more computation these kind of things he

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,370
even found more interestingly that when

00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:06,130
you do vanilla JavaScript without the

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,560
library the more pictures who did it

00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:10,720
started evening out and it started

00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,390
actually becoming faster again because

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,090
the browser caches stuff for you the

00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,950
JavaScript engine reuses things that are

00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,300
already being there like okay I notice I

00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,700
don't have to touch it anymore because

00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,620
it hasn't changed where it's like doing

00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,300
clever things in your library means like

00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,190
you start from scratch every single time

00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,230
again so we need to learn in these

00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,300
libraries to do the same kind of caching

00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,670
if you read the same Dom element in

00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,470
jQuery 16 times it should come from a

00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,140
cache and not be read from document

00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:41,200
again but this is very interesting that

00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,720
we optimize the JavaScript engines 40s

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,370
end cases and we don't get these end

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,320
cases any longer because people think

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,470
JavaScript engines are too slow from the

00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,360
very beginning and they're not browsers

00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,620
to an incredibly amount of work for us

00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,180
and we always just complain when

00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,070
something is broken if you think about

00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,530
it and you work your work with browser

00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,350
makers they display all kind of media

00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:04,270
content like how many images out there

00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,070
are in the wrong format with the wrong

00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,140
file name in the wrong mime type and the

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:10,420
browser will still show them people can

00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,040
put bitmap bmps on the web and the

00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,480
browser will render them instead of

00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,690
hurting those people which would be the

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,670
right thing to do it fixes minor

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,590
mistakes in our code you don't close a P

00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,930
tag the browser closes it for you we

00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,700
gave up on developers we just expect you

00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:27,400
to do mistakes and the browser should

00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:30,010
fix it for us and this is called like a

00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,740
good programming nowadays or something

00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,180
we optimize our code to run smoothly the

00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,580
amount of stuff that you chakra

00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,260
JavaScript engine does two for loops by

00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,910
Lou by reading through them in

00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,710
seeing if there's a function called and

00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:44,410
embed that function into the other one

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:47,140
before creating a binary code from them

00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:49,210
is quite impressive it provides us with

00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,380
developer tools we have full inside over

00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,670
what we're doing but we're still

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,230
complaining it's probably the browser

00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,510
that slow and it's very easy to point

00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:58,600
out that was our mistake and it was just

00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:00,910
bad rendering thrashing of the layout

00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,610
again a young kind of things because of

00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:05,320
that they provide us with deep insights

00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:07,360
what our code does to the computer we

00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,940
cap heap analysis how much RAM we used

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,920
how much CPU were using when i started

00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,450
with javascript i had not even idea what

00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,130
the cpu would be like I couldn't even

00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,600
tested in the operating systems back

00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:19,210
then but now we have it in the browsers

00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,040
it allows us to automate testing on them

00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,440
and debug remotely on devices we don't

00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,600
even own we can use third-party services

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,000
like browser tests and browser link and

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,730
all these kind of things to access a

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,560
iphone in America and that connectivity

00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:35,080
and get the report back how our

00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,960
JavaScript amazed they perform their how

00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,670
awesome is that and and yet we want to

00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,110
have every browser on our machine and

00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,410
tested there rather than just using

00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:45,990
these kind of wonderful environments

00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:49,960
Paul build a great thing called big rig

00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:52,120
which takes a which takes at a scanner

00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,940
file either from chrome or from

00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,590
webpagetest org and it shows you what

00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,020
was going on how much memory was

00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,580
consumed what the CPU was doing where

00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:03,400
your time went and where your

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,500
computation went and using this you can

00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,270
actually tweak your applications and

00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,830
realize where the real bottlenecks are

00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:11,980
instead of just complaining about that

00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:14,590
it's the Dom I was very interesting use

00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,330
the to do MVC application and then use

00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,159
different libraries and compared them

00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:21,159
with each other how much they're in size

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,850
and how much then bootstrap time and on

00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:27,010
a 95 in an iphone 5s and he found out

00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,750
that some of them took up to two seconds

00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:31,240
before they started rendering the first

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:33,340
line and this is all JavaScript

00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,600
execution this is not like talking to

00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:37,480
the browser and all kind of things this

00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,040
is the deed libraries themselves because

00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,050
we want to use them and it makes it

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,030
easier for us as developers but these

00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,100
are two seconds and lots of battery and

00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,510
lots of time on useless machines that

00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,770
they shouldn't have to use because we

00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,860
want to write three lines of JavaScript

00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,149
instead of car instead of 50 it's not

00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,710
about how many lines

00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:55,659
javascript your itís how your code

00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:57,819
behaves at the end users computer

00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:59,770
because these are the people we work for

00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:02,049
we don't work for other developers

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,640
unless you write developer tools we work

00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:05,079
for people out there and they shouldn't

00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,789
have phones that the battery dies

00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,609
because we have a memory leak in the

00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:11,500
background fixing everything with a lot

00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:13,630
of JavaScript helps us but not

00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,549
necessarily our audience javascript has

00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,410
become this duct tape of the web leg if

00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:19,029
something's wrong we do with javascript

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,589
because then we got full control over it

00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:22,450
and we don't not at the mercy of those

00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:24,460
stupid browsers and those terrible

00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,349
environments we just can do everything

00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,849
ourselves because we're infallible and

00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:31,329
we're domestic levers people on the

00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:33,520
planet we all know that so we should

00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:36,250
worry about oops we should worry a lot

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,770
more about costs and costs and Paul

00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,420
talked about this as well costs for

00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,670
developers is learning new frameworks

00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:45,010
like every month there's a new one and

00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,079
we want to have it on our CV so we have

00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,520
to look at it and then version 2 is

00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:50,380
completely completely different to

00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,880
version 1 so we have to relearn them and

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,700
find out what changed and why is it

00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,020
breaking out of a sudden because

00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,359
frameworks is software as well it's the

00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,460
same problems that we have its people

00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:02,140
writing these things debugging

00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,000
frameworks where did this error come

00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,980
from it's obviously not in my code but

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,869
the framework does something wrong so

00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,029
can you debug the framework do you

00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:11,380
understand what the thing is doing or do

00:36:10,029 --> 00:36:12,970
you just have to wait until there's a

00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,140
patch and you'd go back to your client

00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,640
well we have to wait three weeks sorry

00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,369
about that I hope you can pay us for the

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,930
three weeks we're not doing anything

00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:21,160
setting up developer environments so

00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,440
it's like this is easy you're at a

00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,720
command line type Keys 12 things in wait

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,430
for 15 minutes of em p.m. with 12 with

00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,849
200 warnings and then everything will be

00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:34,630
fine or like oh you need you need a

00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:38,200
macbook pro to run this JavaScript no no

00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:40,029
sorry and cutting down on possible hires

00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,150
and adding two on boarding time if your

00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:47,109
company subscribed to I 02 I don't know

00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:48,910
a blah blah framework so and so you only

00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:50,920
can hire people that are happy to use

00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,180
blah blah framework so and so and you

00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,410
actually cut down on those feet but

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,319
doesn't work most of time are the more

00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,789
expensive ones as well the real

00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:00,190
important bit is the cost for our

00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:03,579
end-users time to load and execute the

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:05,920
bandwidths used you remember 66 pound

00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:07,359
per megabyte CPU

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,190
search the frame rate if it's less than

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,839
60 frames per seconds and we had that in

00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,880
the first talk today it feels icky

00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:15,339
people will complain that it's not fast

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,170
no matter how fast it really is memory

00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:18,970
usage because memory is not endless as

00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,549
well and that actually ties into battery

00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,160
life as well if your website sucks my

00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:25,510
battery dry that's not a good service

00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,609
it's time to clean up and learn the

00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,190
basics I love that BYE MOM now to post

00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:32,200
yesterday find meaningless code why was

00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,119
it put their future proofing rip out the

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,970
code the future is here and it's not

00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,650
happy with your proofing we are crap at

00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,270
predicting the future we really are if

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,130
we were we could play the lottery and

00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:44,410
don't have to work anymore but all of

00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:47,020
our code or a clever code predicts

00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,670
problems of the future wait until the

00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,670
problems are there and write code for

00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:53,500
now that is fast small and behaves

00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,480
really well on our end users computers

00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,579
worry about the problems that are coming

00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,530
with scale when they're coming there's

00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:01,150
nothing worse that when you have lots of

00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,069
users and it gets slowed that's a good

00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,349
problem to have because those users pay

00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:06,970
money then you actually get paid to fix

00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:09,970
these things rather than hoping the

00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,589
future will come the JavaScript learning

00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,349
process has always been kind of

00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:15,670
interesting what do we do we use view

00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:18,220
source to see what other people are

00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,809
doing then we copy and paste the bits

00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,510
that look like they're responsible for

00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:25,960
some things then we change some numbers

00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:30,099
around we run into errors and we blame

00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:32,290
Internet Explorer that was back then no

00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,030
of course now we're all like full stack

00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,440
developers and whatever we call

00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:38,470
ourselves right now so be much more

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,559
professional so nowadays we search for a

00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:42,880
solution on stack overflow we copy and

00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:45,130
paste the bits that look like they're

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,170
responsible for some things we change

00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,119
some numbers around we run into errors

00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,760
and we blame JavaScript for being a

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:55,049
terrible and not a real language and we

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,049
blame Internet Explorer for good measure

00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:00,490
we're running out of both excuses first

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,349
of all internet explorer is dead Windows

00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,569
10 is the operating system there's a

00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:06,130
free upgrade the browser's evergreen

00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:08,200
like all the others i love that at the

00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:12,069
MVP summit unattended laptops will be

00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:15,130
upgraded to windows 10 javascript grew

00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:18,970
up as well es6 is here it's a ratified

00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:19,540
standard we as 2016 2015 is not es6 is

00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,060
rat

00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,670
I'd since June we have a standard and

00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,980
it's not the what is javascript anymore

00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,960
it's ECMO script six is the is here and

00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:31,480
it's backwards compatible and has a lot

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,670
of good changes in it the support is

00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,450
encouraging we got edge Firefox Chrome

00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:39,700
Safari on is on iOS 9 Safari is really

00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,980
really good and that's uncommon because

00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,390
a lot of other things Safari is like not

00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,890
as good any longer and they're not as

00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:49,600
fast as implementing us because reasons

00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:51,100
there's a compatibility table at Kang X

00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,080
website is really really good for

00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,810
finding out what's going on some numbers

00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,930
edge is eighty percent Firefox 4271

00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,800
percent chrome is sixty-three percent

00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,570
Android twenty-nine percent and

00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,970
fifty-four percent so a lot of stuff you

00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:05,950
can use one hundred percent is not

00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,290
possible to achieve right now because a

00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:10,900
few of the standard bits would break a

00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,580
wrist already existing functionality we

00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,410
found websites that run all version of

00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,350
mood tools for example and we cannot use

00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:18,580
array contains in our JavaScript engine

00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,160
because of deaths because it would break

00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:23,740
old websites browser innovation also

00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,480
means don't break the web because we are

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,670
not allowed to do that but we as

00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:31,390
developers broke the web by using things

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:34,390
too early now with year six we have a

00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,980
clean new slate and the new baseline is

00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,690
here i love that by kyle symes in the

00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,160
other day a new baseline for modern

00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,720
JavaScript competency includes

00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,150
understanding how to effectively use

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,930
promises generators for a sync up your

00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:48,850
game and I don't know up your game I

00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,560
think about these like bros drinking

00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:53,140
beer when I hear that kind of stuff I'm

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,940
very allergic to this you know I'm like

00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,620
we're in high school trying to impress

00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,360
each other how much more JavaScript we

00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,830
know our JavaScript knowledge should

00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,140
make better products for our end users

00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:04,990
that's the main reason everything else

00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:07,600
is a nice to have everything else is

00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:09,370
unnecessary and if if you write better

00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,650
code and faster code by using all these

00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,960
things good for you but other than that

00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:15,490
as he as you said like as well I'm

00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,170
trying to turn over a new leaf or

00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,240
encourage people to less Nick the

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:21,370
negativity I won't fully succeed but I'm

00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:24,250
trying and then like it's just the face

00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:25,840
of burnout because if we if we up each

00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,150
other all the time we like this is what

00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,920
we have to use we're burning out and for

00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,420
nothing and we're not burning out for

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,430
creating better things for our end users

00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,079
we're burning up by trying to

00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,450
one another who's going to be the best

00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:38,829
JavaScript developer on this planet you

00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:40,359
know when people come up to me and

00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:43,240
select do you think that guys better

00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:44,710
than you and I'm not maybe I don't care

00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,540
I want to be better tomorrow than I'm

00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:49,329
here denim today I'm comparing myself

00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:51,640
with myself and then I can overtake

00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:53,140
anybody else if I compare myself with

00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,520
other people all the time I just get

00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,710
frustrated there's a lot of frustration

00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,420
going on in our market controlled

00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:01,089
environments allow us to use the newest

00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,530
and coolest and find best practices so

00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:04,900
if you're using server side JavaScript

00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:07,270
and you're running node make that work

00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,190
across all platforms any node solution

00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,839
that only works on mac is terrible you

00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:14,650
might as well right right native code

00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:16,630
and use everything you can find in es6

00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,460
that you want to use and use it to the

00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:19,839
best practice in the right patterns in

00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:24,490
the node environment because you control

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:26,950
it for example vs code was released

00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:29,650
yesterday open source it's running on

00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:31,240
node so play with that hack type thing

00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,980
to death find something cool in there

00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,390
Adam editor we saw that earlier as well

00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,910
these are the environments where we can

00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:39,130
play because we control them this is our

00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,109
stuff so let's play with the newest and

00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:43,290
coolest inside of those but don't play

00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:45,490
for end users because they cannot use it

00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:47,770
let's not make JavaScript wrote the

00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,329
world overly complex and scary this is

00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,589
the entrance to my dental office in

00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:52,510
London I don't know why I'm going there

00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:53,980
but it's really like a horror movie but

00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,420
you saw that earlier we don't we

00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,559
shouldn't shock people with what they

00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:02,109
need to do if they want to write

00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:04,569
javascript is 6 7 2015 2029 caters to

00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:06,490
different audiences each of these parts

00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:08,079
are either for syntactic sugar for the

00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:10,750
jQuery users for scalable applications

00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,490
of a library builders you don't need to

00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,869
know all of it and you don't need to

00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,240
feel depressed if you don't know what a

00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:18,160
symbol means because you will not use it

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,660
if you don't write a library for example

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,089
you do will not use it if you don't

00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,710
write a massive application but you can

00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:26,740
have used templates for the things that

00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:28,480
make sense to you play with it and find

00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,160
out which parts matter to you and start

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,319
loving those parts start kicking the

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,089
tires of those parts start writing good

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,950
things with those parts rather than just

00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:37,900
like oh I should have used that one as

00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:39,670
well because people say so people say a

00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,089
lot of stupid things don't listen to

00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:45,369
people phas allows you to learn and use

00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:47,230
it in the now so that one converts you

00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:49,240
is 62 is 5 so it runs every

00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,710
we're performance issue you don't know

00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,230
what you're controlling but it's great

00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,880
to learn es6 right now because you can

00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,290
run it on any device and you see what's

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,350
actually coming out of it you can see

00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:03,790
what HTML file but what-what es5 gets

00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:06,970
generated from your es6 pony foo has a

00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:09,460
great has a great order so long that's

00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:11,320
wrong link excellent I'm es6 overview

00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,260
and 350 bullet points if you really want

00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,580
to have like chunky bits go damn if you

00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,440
want to read a book that's exploring

00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,570
your six-pack so Roush Maya its online

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,550
for free or it costs like twenty dollars

00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,960
to buy I was one of the editors it's an

00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,750
amazing book it's a really really

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,300
beautiful explanation not only how but

00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:30,160
also the why why were things done in a

00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,440
certain way in es6 and not like okay

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,660
this is it you have to use it now but

00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,340
also let's just calm down a bit and fix

00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,840
and remove what's broken on the web

00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,420
because there's so many things broken

00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:43,180
out there I'm just we have two megabyte

00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:45,430
everywhere 170 things so what's going on

00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,170
there let's fix those as well let's

00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:49,930
analyze and clean up put the web on a

00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:52,150
diet and 12 convenient solution at a

00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,530
time kill those old libraries because we

00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,730
don't need them any longer they're just

00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:59,200
dead weight on the web right now and

00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:00,760
then the helping hand what I'm doing

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,440
right now when I'm feeling depressed I

00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,359
go to github and a look at something

00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,760
that's kind of broken and I fix it and

00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:09,250
then I send it send a request and say

00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,960
like okay I fixed this because this is

00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:13,720
the reasons why I think this is better

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,910
you might get a bit get a response back

00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,310
you know right thats words my code what

00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,619
the hell doesn't matter you still learn

00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:22,750
something from it but you might be lucky

00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:24,580
and you might get something like me the

00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,230
other day when i'm like thanks very much

00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,910
for your input advice on making the

00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:30,460
changes i learned something new today I

00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:32,200
appreciate it take care and this feels

00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,180
good and it's what we should do to each

00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,740
other much much more rather than

00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,720
outbidding each other on who's the

00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:40,330
coolest javascript developer of tomorrow

00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,490
and a JavaScript warrior of the world so

00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:45,490
let's turn education as competition into

00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:47,410
education and fun again and now that you

00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:51,510
don't have to be perfect you can be good

00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:51,510
that's all I had so thanks very much

00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:05,750
yea high priest thanks for your talk I I

00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:09,630
appreciate and I agree everything is big

00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:13,260
excellent yeah and and while grid we as

00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:15,750
um Kim presenter just now as well that

00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:18,320
we developers we also have the tendency

00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:21,270
of over engineering things and and

00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:24,090
Kenley in delivering product and focused

00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:25,860
too much on maybe performance and how

00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:29,880
will you suggest us to balance between

00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:32,010
these are these two things so the

00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,950
question was to how do we how do we find

00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:37,110
how do we stop ourselves from over from

00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:39,570
over architecting and from thinking too

00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:41,880
much about performance I think you can't

00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:43,470
think too much about performance if it

00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,570
means the performance of your end users

00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:47,730
if it means the thing will run better on

00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:49,710
the end machine that's great put as much

00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,570
as time as you want in there and I'd

00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:53,340
rather us work a week longer on a

00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,710
product that is good for our end users

00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:58,110
then to release it and say like where

00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:00,240
the fastest engineers out there when it

00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:02,130
comes to over architecting our things

00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,620
and talking about the future is what I

00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,960
said about we try to predict things of

00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:10,320
the future that will come I'd rather

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,020
have a clean code that is easy to

00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:14,940
understand then have a very generic code

00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:17,010
that can deal with every situation out

00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:20,040
there because this generic code will be

00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:23,580
used to ten percent of what it can do in

00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,740
most of the cases so I think if you find

00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:28,530
that you're using only a part of what

00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:31,020
you've written then you have wasted a

00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:32,580
lot of time at the same time to release

00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:36,140
it as a JavaScript library and when how

00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,140
can use for a day that makes us excited

00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,830
performance is the most important thing

00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:43,650
in terms of what our end users have

00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:46,110
performance of us as developers how much

00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:48,270
code can we turn out in a month is what

00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:50,490
made us what made the web so broken

00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:52,200
right now it's not about how much code

00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:54,930
we write its how much clever code we

00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,480
write how much our code does to our end

00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:58,920
users and that also means we have to

00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,920
communicate much more with other

00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,360
departments where I found ourselves

00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,070
architecting wrongly as well is that we

00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,470
think as developers we have to do

00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:10,470
everything I found for example paper

00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:10,950
prototyping when Yahoo made us go

00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,990
through like

00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,609
five iterations of a tool before we

00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,200
actually build it and we spent the time

00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:18,329
that people spend paid a paper

00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,839
prototyping with end users to write the

00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:23,520
data API is instead so parallel work on

00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,050
different parts of the interface is a

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,150
very important thing we can only do that

00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:28,950
when we start communicating with other

00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:31,079
parts of our company and not only do

00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:33,030
everything in engineering talking to

00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:35,190
humans I know it's scary but it's a good

00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:38,339
thing something will come out of it and

00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:40,890
so kind of you say that we shouldn't

00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:44,460
focus on life was too shiny new

00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:46,890
framework but if um how do you convince

00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:50,180
companies that even if you don't know

00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:54,359
framework X you're a very good developer

00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:56,220
mmm that is a really good question so

00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:57,690
companies won't want you to see the

00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,220
newest and coolest all the time and they

00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:01,560
measure the quality of developers that

00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:06,000
way and I think that's where the whole

00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:08,130
hype thing went pear-shaped in terms of

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,780
like in terms of how do you convince

00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:12,089
companies you show them how much you

00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,369
really know about the basics you you

00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:15,900
shouldn't just guard new frameworks that

00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:18,150
you don't need them you should know what

00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,920
they are and you should know how what

00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,390
use case is there in if you come to an

00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,680
interview and they say look well what do

00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,240
you think about react and you say like

00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,829
for this kind of application that kind

00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,869
of stuff and that kind of things it's a

00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:29,430
really good idea whereas most of the

00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:30,960
time I would go for this kind of

00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:33,750
solution because then it performs better

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,970
any hiring manager who has half a brain

00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:39,270
would be very excited about that answer

00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:40,920
so getting found in LinkedIn is a

00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:42,990
different story but that's also the jobs

00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,670
that you normally don't get I think one

00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:47,220
of my favorite moments was when I hired

00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:49,500
a javascript engineer in in Mozilla I

00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:52,020
know in yahoo begged them we gave people

00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,609
a drop an exercise a website to build

00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:56,190
which is illegal in California but in

00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:57,869
England we could do it and the

00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,030
javascript parts of it were kind of

00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:01,349
tricky liver they looked very simple but

00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,660
I had a few mistakes in them and these

00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:05,970
kind of things and the guy who came in

00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,829
had used all the examples from my

00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:09,300
javascript book and he didn't know that

00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:11,550
I'm the guy interviewing JavaScript

00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,109
developers so he came into the room and

00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,790
he was as wide as the wall when I came

00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:16,589
in he's like oh my god I'm like yeah i

00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,760
saw that code and i kind of looks

00:50:16,589 --> 00:50:19,680
familiar and he's like yeah it's from

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,930
your book and like what didn't you like

00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,790
about my code and what would you what

00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,910
would you make to better and the

00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:28,000
explained that I hired him

00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:30,010
spot there's no problem using code when

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,630
you understand it when you don't

00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:34,390
understand and you try to impress people

00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:36,070
by listing five different modules and

00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:38,790
hoping they don't understand it either

00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:40,990
then we have a communication problem so

00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:42,400
understanding how much you use things

00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:44,290
for is something that more and more

00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,990
companies will look forward to as well

00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:49,540
when we get or less excited about hiring

00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:54,280
50 developers because company growth is

00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:56,080
something that TechCrunch loves all

00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,730
right I think we can close it here big

00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,780
hands for Chris and thank you so much

00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,780
