hi there I think thank you for staying

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,859
this late I'm between you and the

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:23,010
cocktails so I'll try to be quick but

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,710
interesting at the same time i'm here to

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,820
talk today about the node foundation how

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,340
many of you guys are users of known so

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,040
about half that's pretty good alright

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,510
and some of this you're going to know

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,760
about it there's also a little history

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,700
lesson in here because i like to remind

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,230
people of where we came from and you

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,280
know i've been talking about open source

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,649
for almost 20 years now and i love it

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,960
that we that we won to the extent that

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,149
we have one but i noticed that if we

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,760
don't stay vigilant and keep reminding

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,670
people especially new people what's

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,940
happening we run the risk of losing it

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,400
again because it's a slippery slope it's

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,890
really easy to give up you know little

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,110
concessions along the way that the you

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,560
know add up to the end of open source so

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:20,720
we'll talk about that a little bit too

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:24,000
all right so jun 2014 I was at foo camp

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,670
which is a conference that Tim O'Reilly

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,790
gives it's an invitational conference in

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,360
his backyard and he literally pitch

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,520
tents and you know I was kind of minding

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,150
my own business in there and this guy

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,899
walks up to me this is michael rogers

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,780
and he has been caring about JavaScript

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,990
and and also know Jas for quite a long

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,140
time now and he wanted to understand

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,780
about copyright because there had just

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,149
been a change in the node community the

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,719
trademark holder of node had

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:03,240
unilaterally decided to stop aggregating

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,740
copyright that means you didn't have to

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,770
sign the little piece of paper anymore

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,750
to give a contribution and he wanted to

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,060
understand what the effect of that was

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,700
going to be and exactly what was going

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,590
to happen

00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:19,629
next and as it happened I did know a

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,310
little bit about node and the reason

00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:23,019
that I knew about note at all was

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:28,480
because I had gone to work a few months

00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:34,200
earlier for paypal so paypal switched to

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:37,319
node in 2013 and they did this in a very

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,930
calculated way some of you may have seen

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,849
this gentleman talking about the switch

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,400
because he was kind of the architect of

00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:48,459
it this is bill Scott he came from

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,190
netflix to paypal with the goal of

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:54,069
changing the way that paypal front ended

00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:58,329
and he wanted to use this tool this tool

00:02:54,069 --> 00:03:01,780
node and at the time at 2013 paypal was

00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:04,480
still front ending in java and he's from

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,940
texas he's a really sweet guy and when

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,510
the people at PayPal that were nervous

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:14,200
about change asked him you know what he

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:17,109
was doing he said I'm just prototype in

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,319
you don't have to worry I'm just proud

00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:21,970
to type in and he knew that eventually

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,010
this was going to end up being

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,440
production code but he also knew that

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,450
they weren't ready to hear it yet he

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,060
waited until the Java developers were

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:34,510
begging to be allowed to use node

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:37,450
because two people very small team were

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,049
able to get more done than like our team

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,609
of 25 people trying to front end in Java

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:45,370
and they were losing the race so they

00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:48,160
wanted to switch to the other side so

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,350
anyway this is why I knew about it he

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,569
called me up and said I would like you

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:57,150
to talk to us about how to make our

00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,940
contribution to the open source world

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,470
around node really successful and that

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,870
was the first you're going to do this

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:10,319
for me what are you doing oh that's

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,319
terrible Apple all right

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:19,190
so in 2014 we will they released Kraken

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:22,070
the beginning of the year I had helped

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:26,120
them with all the details of it to make

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,430
it have the best possible landing and I

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,490
did this as a consultant and lo and

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,930
behold it was really successful and they

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,810
listen to me carefully and they did

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,210
everything I told them to do so then

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,330
they said you should be an employee and

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:44,479
I said well why would I do that I'm a

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,430
consultant I like my life and they they

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,169
basically made it so I couldn't say no

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,840
one of the things they did was they let

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,610
me keep my consultancy open so I have a

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,440
lot of interesting conversations with

00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:59,900
people but back then when they released

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,130
Kraken which is a framework that sits on

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:07,310
top of express and mix node run at

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:09,020
PayPal scale which is lots and lots of

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,250
transactions especially at Christmas

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:15,139
time and it's kind of a bumper area so

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,090
that our developers have a lot of choice

00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:19,220
they can pick whatever modules they

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,720
think they want to use but they can't

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,120
get in too much trouble because this

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,560
framework is keeping making sure that

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,570
they can run at scale this is a these

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,630
are the companies that were using node

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,700
in everyday work in 2014 when we

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,070
released crackin and this is from an

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,220
article that Joyent who's the trademark

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,110
holder was what you know put out and it

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,590
was impressive list I was really

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,330
surprised Wow all right we'll just keep

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,449
doing this periodically until it goes

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:54,229
away but also they had a passionate

00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:57,070
ecosystem I noticed I noticed that

00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:59,840
because somebody started a campaign of

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,780
people from the ecosystem introducing

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,520
themselves to me as I was joining paypal

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,139
because they were hoping that we would

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,000
do more for node that we would be more

00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:10,460
interested in no time we we you know

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,960
keep lifting it Michael had already

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,949
explained to me that there was a problem

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,630
and so you know I knew that something

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:21,200
was coming so I started a conversation

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:26,330
with this guy this is a his knee

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:28,160
um Stewart Hammond sorry it's because

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,840
the network is out so it won't let me

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,360
actually quit out of that piece of

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:38,180
software do what ignore thank you I did

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,990
try that once before just so you know so

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:45,170
um this is the guy Scott Hammond who is

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,960
the CEO of giant who owned the trademark

00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,300
for node and who had made the he's not

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,790
the one who made the decision but I

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,740
started talking to him because he's the

00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,240
one who would have to make a decision if

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,730
something was going to change for node

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,580
and I spent a lot of time talking to him

00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,680
and I want to say he's and he's a smart

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,460
man he's very interested in getting it

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,100
right he's passionate about doing the

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:13,070
right things for the technology but also

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,170
getting some credit for what he thinks

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,750
was reasonable stewardship even though

00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:20,330
he wasn't there he's a brand new CEO but

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,850
he likes the idea that his company looks

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,340
you know does well in addition to know

00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:29,630
doing well and I wanted to help him out

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:32,750
I really did so over time we we we got

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:35,180
there but I gotta say that it's really

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,940
hard to learn open source if you're from

00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,400
a proprietary point of view he's had

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,320
various things that he didn't understand

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,390
over the time that that we've been

00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,950
talking and he gets through them and

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,020
then and then another one comes up and

00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:51,140
it's really interesting because it remit

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:56,320
mirrors my consulting world when I had

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,320
to explain it to clients so for instance

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,900
one day he was very upset because one of

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:05,090
the major vendors in the node space was

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,090
wrapping the open source code was the

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,530
proprietary code and in putting it out

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,000
as a product and he didn't think that

00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,310
that should be possible because it was

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,650
open source and I said permissive

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,960
licensing dude that's the name of the

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:21,050
game that's what you want you want that

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,170
adoption he's like really why do I want

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,420
this you know endless problems like that

00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,930
and the main one was and it took me a

00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:33,530
long time to realize his focus is on end

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,080
users not on the developers that are

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,450
create

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,450
the software because in his business

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,280
life he has to focus on the end user and

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,760
he thinks of the developers his

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:47,130
employees as cogs in a wheel like a lot

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,040
of employers but of course open source

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,530
turns out on its head those those core

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,560
developers are the whole deal they're

00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:57,450
everything and the users it's nice if

00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,520
the users can use the software but it's

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,790
really about those core developers so

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,460
this was a little different for him but

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:09,240
we we slide through it now we're going

00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:10,740
to have time out first story so remember

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,900
that I talked that i was talking to

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,580
Scott Hammond we're going to talk about

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:20,100
a completely different thing that

00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:22,380
happened 12 years earlier okay so once

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,960
upon a time there was this technology

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,780
called Java you guys all know Java how

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:32,790
many of you have coded in java yeah okay

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:35,730
good so Java was not open source java

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:40,290
had not been open source ever and it was

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:44,100
problematic until this guy made a

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:48,060
statement at a conference in Tokyo he

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:52,950
said the Java would be open source the

00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,840
next year and then he quit I don't want

00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,210
to comment on mr. Barrett's and why he

00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,430
would do that but shortly after that I

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,100
got tapped on the shoulder and a sushi

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,530
bar in cupertino across from Apple's

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:08,580
headquarters and asked if I wanted to

00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:11,070
open source java and i called my husband

00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,460
up like i do and i said do i want to

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:17,040
open source java he said yes you do yes

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,360
you want to do that and i said why do I

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,600
want to do that he said cuz you're

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:25,230
really stubborn and you probably get it

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,710
right eventually alright so when mr.

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,990
Barrett's left there was a power vacuum

00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,880
this is a dyson vacuum but that the what

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,940
I'm talking about is there was no

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,990
leadership in the company and the people

00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:44,040
who invested in Java were really upset

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:46,560
so I you may know that for the ten first

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,820
years of Java the biggest companies in

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,640
the valley all gave

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,710
million dollars apiece every year so

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,240
that Java would be developed son figured

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,250
out that they could create partnerships

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,410
with all these companies because

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,740
everybody wanted this thing the idea of

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,750
write once run anywhere was really

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,520
compelling so everybody wanted a piece

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:10,770
of that so they could they showed up

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,400
though they are the people who'd been

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,020
paying money in and they said son you

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,580
don't have your act together you need to

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,340
give us this technology we've been

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,710
paying for all this time I mean give it

00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,800
to us we shouldn't be running this

00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,630
anymore you're bad stewards right and

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,010
this was some of the biggest companies

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,830
you could their household names you know

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:35,100
most of them and you know what to do

00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,980
what to do right well this guy and this

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,350
is the best picture I could find of him

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:44,220
this is John canna guard and he is the

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:46,350
unsung hero of open source java he's the

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:51,720
one who was running java soft the

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:54,660
division he said you know what it's true

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,640
that we have a power vacuum and it's

00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,520
true that they've been putting money in

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,590
but they're the wrong people to run java

00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,600
going forward java should be run by

00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:07,320
everybody who has a stake in the game

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,110
and so really what was happening was he

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,570
kind of put on his his colored glasses

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,760
his rose-colored glasses and he came up

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,440
with this idea of this sort of commune

00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,150
that they were going to start around

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,330
java and it was going to be called the

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:25,200
java community process now he's the one

00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:29,430
who had pushed Tomcat so tom cat came

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:32,310
from a very senior person who you know

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,440
saw the opportunity and put money

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,440
together to build a team to create

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,350
Tomcat which was the servlet api put

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,970
into open source out of java and they

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,790
did it because microsoft was get

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,620
otherwise on the web and they needed to

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,480
drive adoption and this was the fastest

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,360
way to drive adoption for an alternative

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,980
so that's why we have tomcat so he was

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,280
kind of a visionary about open source

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,530
from the beginning and then we started

00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,200
the java community process he asked me

00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:04,170
to get Apache involved

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,750
and I did that I've been an Apache

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,300
member for a long time I told them you

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,030
know this is it this is an opportunity

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,650
because you guys care about Java I don't

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,810
know how much of a hassle it's going to

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,460
be I'll just warn you you're going to be

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,100
the only ones that are really pushing

00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,350
for open source but you know canna guard

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:27,180
wants this to happen and they said okay

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:30,170
we'll do it so so then and here we are

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:34,680
again all right you think that if I do

00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:43,470
what I can't do that and I can't do that

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:45,450
either apparently Apple I don't know

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,070
what to do with this now I think we're

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:51,210
gonna have to escape out of it and try

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,710
do this all right I think that's really

00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:56,310
still not going to work but we'll try it

00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:58,470
all right so they were they were happy

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:02,910
together tom cat was doing really well

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:05,760
and then it came time to renegotiate the

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:08,490
document that bound all of the members

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,610
of the java community together and this

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:14,640
includes IBM and oracle and motorola and

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:17,400
apple and God and everybody Microsoft

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,870
even everybody's in there right they

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,880
wanted to renegotiate it because there

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,790
were some bugs in the process they found

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:28,470
and so they're doing this and the guy

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:30,390
from Apache and the guy from Apache is

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,570
caught is sitting through these long

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:35,910
calls every week two hours of his time

00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,190
three hours of his time and he's a

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:41,810
volunteer but he's in there he's working

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:46,470
hard to get that done and one time he

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:49,410
asks the lawyer on a call would it be

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,630
possible to do tom cat under this new

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,610
agreement because that was what was

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,260
happening at Apache all they cared about

00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,590
was you know are we going to be in

00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:01,380
violation of this future agreement and

00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:04,290
the answer was tom cat wouldn't be

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,330
possible even son could not do open

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:10,160
source java under the agreement that

00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:13,580
they were writing and you know apache

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,580
they got mad

00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:19,560
they got really mad like 200 200 very

00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,170
influential engineers the members of

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:25,199
Apache were saying well we can't stay in

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,519
this organization because it's not going

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,279
to be open source anymore and that's

00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,970
what we're here for so they announced

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:36,240
that they were going to leave and now

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:39,089
that could not happen so they negotiated

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,399
a compromise and these guys are the ones

00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:45,360
who did it the one on this side is Rob

00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:48,209
jingle he was the CTO of Java soft and

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,779
the one on this side is Jason hunter and

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:53,189
he actually lives in singapore now so I

00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,620
had dinner with him a couple nights ago

00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:57,689
but he's the one who was on the phone

00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,250
for these long long calls and they

00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:01,920
negotiated something that they called

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:05,069
the Apache compromise it basically said

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,810
that Apache should be allowed because

00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:08,790
they're good guys and they care about

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,129
compatibility and they have the right

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,290
goals for java they're not trying to

00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:16,649
break it they should be allowed to

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,569
reimplement the java specs in open

00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:23,069
source as long as they do it compatibly

00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:26,459
this was a huge piece of news in 2003

00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:29,100
because I had been working since 1999 to

00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:31,589
try to open source java and mostly i got

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,259
this from the people that wrote java so

00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:37,829
this was a really big change so then I

00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:39,870
convinced Rob that it needed to be

00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:42,720
something that was publicly known

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:45,060
because transparency open source and

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,689
Java one was what was going to happen

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:51,300
like the next week so could we just walk

00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:54,060
on stage and have a conversation maybe

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,339
between keynotes because rob was going

00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:01,170
to be the emcee of java one that year

00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:03,360
and so there was no way to get a real

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,549
announcement out because PR it takes

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,860
months to do those announcements but

00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:10,589
also they didn't like the idea of this

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,750
they were part of this you know they

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:16,049
didn't want to see java open sourced and

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,669
so but they didn't want to fire me

00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:20,490
either they just could have left me

00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:23,730
around so now you have to think about

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:27,720
this six in the morning we're walking

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:30,330
across Howard Street to go in

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,820
do the rehearsal for the keynote this is

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,350
Jason and me now it's really early in

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,390
the morning for Jason he's a programmer

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,700
how many of you like to get up at six in

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:42,480
the morning yeah like almost nobody

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:44,640
right so he's grumpy and we're walking

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,669
across the street across the zebra

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:53,400
crossing and we run and see I told you

00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:57,900
it was going to do it sorry well I made

00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:00,840
it go away though okay and so we run

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,140
into this lady she was in charge of

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,700
brand her name was Tracy stout and she

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,010
and I are walking across the crosswalk

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,130
and she says what are you doing here

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,960
Denise and I said oh I have my friend

00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,700
Jason hunter he's going to be on stage

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,190
really briefly between two of the

00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,620
keynotes he's from Apache he's going to

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,559
talk about open source java and she says

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,970
that's nice and then we get down down

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:29,580
the stairs she goes into the green room

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:32,340
where scott mcnealy who has a keynote

00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:35,309
that day is not happy with his speech

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,890
and you see how in this picture scott is

00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:40,470
holding select a little stack of cards

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,840
that's how he did his keynotes they were

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,000
written out very very specifically and

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,440
then he'd rip went off and throw it over

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,870
his shoulder sometimes in the middle of

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,059
the keynote you know right so he's

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:54,120
backstage he doesn't like his talk and

00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:58,440
he is throwing cards and he's yelling

00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:01,200
and everybody's terrified and Tracy

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,580
comes in and she says he basically he's

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,309
upset because he doesn't think there's

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,860
anything newsworthy in his keynote he

00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:10,230
says I'm the CEO there should be

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,880
something interesting in this talk why

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:15,450
can't I get something interesting to say

00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,400
and Tracy says I just ran into Denise in

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,669
the crosswalk and she's got this guy

00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:25,169
from Apache and open source java and he

00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:28,020
says bring me that kid ok so we're in

00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:30,390
the front of the house jason has his

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:33,179
microphone on we're standing there and

00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,770
he's all gaga because because james

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:37,080
gosling is standing there and he's

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,870
talking to him there's nobody there in

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,169
the in the audience at all it's six in

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:48,179
the more

00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:51,149
right and so Scott Scott gets a hold of

00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:54,389
jason and the next thing I know Jason is

00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:56,700
the featured event at Scott's keynote

00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:59,999
and they stand on stage and they talk

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,340
about open source java in front of not

00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:04,409
only the 28,000 people that are

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,119
physically in the room because they're

00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:08,730
literally are that many people that fit

00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,049
in moscone but also the millions of

00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,970
people that are watching this stream

00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:13,919
this is the moment that it really

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,259
happened that we knew there would be

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,609
open Java but it took all of those

00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:24,600
coincidences and all of that sort of

00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:26,279
clandestine belief to make it happen so

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,649
is happy news for everybody that was

00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:30,269
there by the way I really really hard

00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:33,330
time finding a good picture of the

00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:36,359
inside of moscone I will say it was not

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,769
happy news for everyone so you see how

00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,989
you're sitting in the front row here

00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:43,019
that's what happens when you are

00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:45,749
babysitting a keynote at javaone they

00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:48,960
make you sit in the front row and behind

00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:52,289
you are all the people that work at Sun

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,139
and I mean every VP every director and

00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:58,350
they're all angry because we got this

00:20:55,139 --> 00:21:01,559
news out the door without any approval

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,960
any PR any anything and of course as

00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:06,899
soon as the keynotes over every reporter

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,989
wants to know they're all really

00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:11,700
interested in this big change so what

00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:14,519
was the story what was this story about

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:17,730
this is how much work it was it used to

00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:20,669
be to open source stuff it was really

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:23,190
hard and it took it took like acts of

00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:26,190
God to get these companies to give up

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:29,129
their IP these days everybody gets it I

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,710
mean node is worth not quite as much as

00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:35,279
Java but it's getting it the momentum of

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:37,320
how fast note is becoming the way you do

00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,759
a front end and even the way you do sort

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,519
of the middleware and parts of the back

00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,980
end it's amazing how fast it's happening

00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,259
and and a lot of that is being driven by

00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,080
the fact that it's open source you know

00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:52,109
son spent an incredible amounts of money

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,400
getting every single kid in the cs

00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:56,700
departments of the world

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,170
to learn java and and i don't know that

00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,780
they're teaching note i think they're

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:02,700
still teaching java because they're sort

00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,340
of stuck in the old way of doing things

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:08,100
but note is available for everybody to

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:13,110
use and learn and it really is becoming

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:16,050
the the tool of choice so i just say the

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,430
rest is history meanwhile now we're

00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:21,810
going to come back through the present

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:23,910
back at node we set up an advisory board

00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:26,070
as soon as God Hammond was comfortable

00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,230
enough to do that and it was all the

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,750
stakeholders that were agitating for

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:34,470
change including some really really big

00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:37,740
companies and we met publicly we met

00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:39,360
every month we you know slowly but

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,660
surely we're starting to talk about what

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,480
should happen not everybody loves

00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,610
process however and a lot of the key

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,130
engineers that were working on note in

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:53,280
the technical committee got really bored

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:57,120
and they ended up famously creating a

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,310
community fork I ojs and this turned out

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,680
to be a really valuable thing that they

00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:04,620
did so when they spend a lot of energy

00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,010
and how they wanted to work together in

00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,660
the future how things needed to change

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:12,740
for them to feel comfortable and they

00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:15,000
documented that stuff really well

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,740
Michael Rogers who you saw the picture

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,930
of earlier was kind of in the middle of

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,080
making sure that documentation was clean

00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:24,000
and reasonable and there were good you

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,440
know well thought out plans for how

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,350
things were going to change and move

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,080
forward totally valuable work and

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:36,960
honestly no foundation wouldn't exist

00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:38,610
without that work today so we got them

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,550
started talking to the linux foundation

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:45,990
that turned out to be the best partner

00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:49,470
for scott for giant because they really

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,630
talked in business terms a lot of their

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,700
thrust is about is about earning money

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:57,150
for the technology so that it can go

00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:00,870
forward and so that's why we went with

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:02,820
them we had a panel at node summit where

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,710
we first talked about the likelihood

00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,790
that this was going to happen really for

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:10,830
real in june and the guy on the on this

00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:13,050
side here that's Jim's Emlyn who runs

00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:16,620
the linux foundation so that was a group

00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:18,690
of interested parties including yes God

00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,340
Hammond is in the middle there talking

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,760
about the desire to create a foundation

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:26,550
and the hope that I ojs would come back

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,280
into the fold now there haven't been

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:31,260
that many Forks that have healed in the

00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,950
history of open-source just a handful

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,780
maybe like less than five total and the

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,990
biggest one was pearl and that was

00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,150
almost 25 30 years ago now so I was

00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:45,300
really excited to be involved on in

00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:48,510
fixing this one and eventually we got

00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,390
chartered yes in August and that was a

00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:53,550
really really big deal I ojs said that

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,100
they would come back if we if we did it

00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:58,050
properly this is where we are now with

00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,640
sponsoring members it's a lot of big

00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:02,250
companies and a lot of small companies

00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:06,270
that are involved in the node community

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:08,160
and this is a pay-to-play board that

00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:11,250
means all these people are paying money

00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:15,840
to have a seat somewhere on the table

00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:17,610
that to me is a bug in open source I

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,750
honestly think that pay to play is the

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:24,990
wrong way to go because think about it

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:29,490
open source is people I am involved in

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:32,880
node but because I have a seat that was

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:36,150
paid for by my company if I were to

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,150
leave paypal i would also be walking

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:41,070
away from that seed and that's not how

00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,840
open source works open source is about

00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,120
people becoming passionate about

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,120
technology and sticking it out

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,090
regardless of where they sit you know

00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,710
when i left son i was sitting on the OSI

00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:56,190
board the Open Source Initiative board

00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:58,230
and we had just changed presidents went

00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,630
from the guy who had done it for a long

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:04,080
time you guys probably know eric raymond

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:06,630
to michael teman who worked for red hat

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,750
and i got a memo from jonathan schwartz

00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:12,390
that said I'm uncomfortable with red hat

00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:16,260
holding this seat why didn't you take it

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:18,250
now I had given notice his son I was

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,740
just working out my you know

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,590
the weeks until I changed and went off

00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,350
to work for Intel and so I wrote back to

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,850
him I said well first of all Jonathan

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,830
you don't really have a seat on the

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,560
board I have a seat on the board I

00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:35,170
happen to work for you but I actually

00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:39,100
gave notice you know three weeks ago and

00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:41,260
don't they tell you anything and and I'm

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,270
not going to be here much longer and

00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,970
then some won't have any representatives

00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,860
on OSI board because I'm going to go

00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:50,080
work for Intel so then Intel will have

00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,420
one you know so trying to explain to him

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,000
how that goes they're used to pay to

00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,950
play they're used to a different kind of

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,960
arrangement and they're not they think

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,780
of resources and when I say they I mean

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,030
corporations think of resources as

00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,850
fungible so remember i talked about how

00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:10,240
Scott was thinking about the users but

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,460
not the engineers even a even a company

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,890
like son that's totally organized around

00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,560
engineering still thinks of the

00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:20,380
engineers as kind of cogs in a big

00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,910
machine you know and we can tell you

00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,160
where to work and we can tell you where

00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,290
to work after that we can put you on an

00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,210
open source project and get you all spun

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:30,010
up and then decide that it's not a good

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:33,880
investment and pull you off of it and

00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:37,210
you should leave gracefully that's not

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,430
open source open source is like hell I'm

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,490
gonna leave I've got stuff to do here

00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:45,850
I'm interested in this project you know

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:47,470
that's that's open source and and I'm

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:49,840
taking my seat with me when I leave

00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:53,080
because I'm the one doing the work not

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,270
you so I think it's important that we

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,070
remember that if you work for a company

00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:59,800
that allows you to work on an open

00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:02,260
source and they expect to be able to

00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,080
tell you when to stop you might want to

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,880
find another company do really good work

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:14,320
on that project you it shouldn't be too

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:17,920
hard okay come on Oh again again all

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,260
right there we go so node has a

00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,360
technical steering committee the board

00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,340
does not tell them what to do the

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,350
technical decisions are handled by the

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:29,710
steering committee this is in the bylaws

00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,929
this is a condition of I ojs coming back

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,789
and it's the way open source

00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:36,360
should be run because they're in it

00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:39,039
because they care not because they paid

00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,409
so this is one modification that we're

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,629
making to try to get to better open

00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:47,259
source behavior their mission is really

00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:50,350
good mission they exist as a board as a

00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:53,860
foundation to promote through open

00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:56,230
development in transparency the

00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:00,059
furthering of nodejs that is our that is

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:02,950
our mission it's pretty straightforward

00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:04,389
we have some working agreements like the

00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,100
one I mentioned before where the

00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:09,759
technical steering committee does not

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:12,460
get interference from from the board the

00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:16,299
board works on fiduciary things like is

00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:19,779
the trademark being serviced is there

00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:21,789
enough money can we do is or do we need

00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:23,619
something in the community like this sum

00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:25,720
is there some missing thing that

00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:28,779
nobody's picking up should we fund that

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,499
those kinds of things but we do not tell

00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:35,830
them what to do the community is rich

00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:38,769
they're really really enthusiastic there

00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,840
they're very diverse extremely diverse

00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:42,909
one of the big things is it's not

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,669
although it's a North American

00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:48,159
Foundation it's not a North American

00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:50,769
project it's a global project which is

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,960
what I'm doing here and why I will be

00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:54,639
doing a lot of node conferences in the

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,169
next year around the world because it's

00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:59,350
really important to get the message out

00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:04,059
we really are trying to not make it a

00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:06,429
North American thing we're hoping to

00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:08,440
create an effective umbrella in the same

00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:11,950
way that Apache is an umbrella for

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,999
projects we're working now on specifying

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:18,100
exactly what our umbrella attracts like

00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:20,590
we don't want every project in the world

00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,139
but we do have some key projects that we

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,379
think need a better home that we depend

00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:30,789
on and the first one that we're probably

00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:35,320
going to look at is Libby V because we

00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:37,299
need it for note for I ojs node and it's

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,029
down to to maintain errs they're looking

00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:41,679
for a home so that's probably the first

00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:43,899
one I really really like their logo too

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,659
isn't it great but we don't know for

00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:46,970
sure the

00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:49,009
this is I'm letting you in on a future

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:52,639
possibility but it's not actually a done

00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:55,789
deal yet we are funding a user

00:30:52,639 --> 00:31:00,200
conference next month and the idea of

00:30:55,789 --> 00:31:02,570
this conference is to create an

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,429
environment where you could bring people

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:07,399
who are making a decision about whether

00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:09,799
to use node so right now if you go to a

00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:13,099
node conf what you're going to meet is

00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:15,999
the crazy community the wacky community

00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:19,369
and and they're very committed and and

00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:23,929
lovely and they don't necessarily sell

00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:27,619
well to future customers you know hi I'm

00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:29,299
from Colonel Sanders okay I'm from

00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:31,070
Kentucky Fried Chicken I need to know

00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:33,019
about this node thing why does that

00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:36,739
person have a dress on isn't that a boy

00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:39,109
you know doesn't work so we're trying to

00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:41,509
make it clear that there's a technical

00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:43,220
community and they need to meet and they

00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:46,489
need to meet around the world but

00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:48,679
there's also the potential user

00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:50,720
community if this ecosystem is going to

00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,970
grow there needs to be good places for

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,429
people to come in in a businesslike way

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,669
feel comfortable about the promise of

00:31:55,429 --> 00:32:00,859
node so that's what this conference is

00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:02,690
so we're calling for people that are

00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:04,429
interested in node that want to see the

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,999
future of node and maybe want to see

00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:09,499
their career grow in the node way to

00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:12,259
consider getting involved with the

00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:14,960
foundation what another change that

00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:18,559
we've made to the sort of standard Linux

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:23,239
Foundation foundation thing is we have

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:25,549
added to community elected seats that

00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:27,590
will be from the community at large so

00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:30,499
you don't have to pay to get one of

00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:33,679
these seats you do have to be elected by

00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:36,379
the members by your peers and anyone can

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,720
become a member of the node foundation

00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:41,599
if you are committed you can do that for

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,369
free if you are not a committer but you

00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:45,799
just really interested you can do it for

00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:47,599
not very much actual money but its low

00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:50,119
price because you're an individual

00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,849
because the goal is to just get people

00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:54,979
involved and hooked into node and so

00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:57,259
those two seats will be will be voting

00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:58,010
seats and they'll come to every board

00:32:57,259 --> 00:33:01,460
meeting and have

00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:06,260
equals say to the rest of us in you know

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:07,760
board like decisions right and I just

00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,800
had to put in a plug for Drupal 8

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,540
because you guys know Drupal 8 we've

00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,090
been waiting for five years for Drupal 8

00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,850
and it came out yesterday andriy spades

00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:19,670
hearts birthday and I also serve on this

00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:24,140
board so yay Drupal 8 how many of you

00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:26,690
know Drupal yay go learn drupal 8 Drupal

00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,570
8 is going to be really exciting and yes

00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:32,150
I do in fact do these both of these

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:34,670
foundations and I'm on about four

00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:37,100
different boards and this is another

00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:39,230
thing you can do for open sources get

00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,360
involved with this side of the business

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,340
because we always need good board

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,530
members in every one of these

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,230
foundations to try to help make good

00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:50,270
decisions that are going to create you

00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,950
know the open-source effect for as many

00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,050
people as possible behind that

00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,790
technology so if you're interested in

00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:59,270
board service it's actually pretty great

00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:01,340
and now let's see i have a glorious 11

00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:04,990
minutes and 14 seconds for questions and

00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:10,159
i will answer any question that you ask

00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:12,860
probably truthfully hi hi so my question

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,840
is more of like how does a company get

00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:17,389
involved with knoji as if they use it

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,270
daily they want to be a part of this and

00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,889
like we're the guys who have to sell to

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,929
our boss like we should be a part of

00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:25,580
this not just use it every day we should

00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:27,830
also be part of the foundation how do we

00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,280
a company or help you become a part of

00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:33,080
the perfect i'm happy to tell you so

00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,419
there's been a lot of research into how

00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:39,260
open source participation works and

00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:41,929
basically it's a pyramid so an Apache

00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:45,649
where we have good statistics we know

00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:47,990
that for every hundred users there are

00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:51,080
10 people who are willing to contribute

00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:54,129
so about one in ten actually come up

00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:58,280
with a contribution and then for every

00:34:54,129 --> 00:35:01,280
ten contributors there's like one or

00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,930
maybe two trusted committers that come

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,090
out of that a trusted committer ship

00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:07,190
means you've taken the time to learn the

00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,740
codebase that you're contributing to and

00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:11,640
you can explain it to somebody else and

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:15,180
you can conduct code

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,030
and help mentor other people so when you

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:21,000
join as a user and you see something

00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:23,900
that you want to fix your job is to

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,160
figure out how to submit that patch

00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,660
listen to the mentor listen to the

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,510
trusted committer make whatever changes

00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:33,000
need to be made until it's acceptable to

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:35,460
that trusted committer believe that they

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,710
have the project's best interest at

00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,090
heart they're not just being mean to you

00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:42,360
there you know like there's a real

00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:44,820
conversation you can have and then learn

00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,490
enough about that process to gradually

00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,890
submit enough patches that you can do it

00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:52,890
and you know how to do it and then you

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,860
can explain it to somebody else we talk

00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:57,960
a lot about that ramp and then lowering

00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,030
the barrier to entry getting people

00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,700
involved in any open source project but

00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:05,930
especially node coming up with a list of

00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:08,340
things that a beginner could do includes

00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:11,160
you're having to read the documentation

00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,200
if it doesn't make sense to you and you

00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,360
figure out what the answer is you could

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,110
write it more clearly so the next person

00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:21,390
wouldn't stumble the same way you do if

00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:24,660
somebody asks a question that you asked

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,370
two months ago and you got an answer you

00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,290
could answer this time because you know

00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,680
the answer now because you heard it two

00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:36,630
months ago it's that layering on of

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:39,030
generosity and an honest human

00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:41,640
connection that makes open source so

00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,500
compelling for developers because you

00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,810
really can get your questions answered

00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,780
you really can learn the new thing you

00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:51,870
really can gain reputation and once you

00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:54,060
have that public reputation you can

00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:56,910
leverage that open source developers get

00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:58,470
paid thirty percent more globally that's

00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:01,110
been confirmed in three different

00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:03,450
studies now why because we're better

00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:06,300
developers because we're willing to let

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:08,190
our code be seen in public that that

00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,500
just automatically makes us better in

00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,450
fact any developer in the whole world if

00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,190
they knew their code was going to be

00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:16,530
seen in public I promise you they'd be

00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:21,230
more careful maybe better developers

00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:24,090
it's just what happens so does that help

00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,340
good Thank You Denise thank you so much

00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:29,300
sure

00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:32,750
all the way like short term to actually

00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,750
