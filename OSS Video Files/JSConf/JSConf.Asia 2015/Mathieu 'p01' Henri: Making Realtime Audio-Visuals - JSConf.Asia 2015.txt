Title: Mathieu 'p01' Henri: Making Realtime Audio-Visuals - JSConf.Asia 2015
Publication date: 2015-12-27
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2015
Description: 
	The web platform is a wonderful playground of artistic and technical expression. The artists of the web often release amazing creations in the most compact form. But you don't have to be a seasoned developer to express yourself and build your own animations. With a bit practice, anyone can build Audio-Visual demos!
This talk will go through creative coding, the demoscene, and a range of optimization tricks. Then we will work on a little Audio-Visual demo together.

I hope this will inspire new JavaScript artists and bring a dash of creativity to our every day problem solving.
Mathieu 'p01' Henri is a JavaScript developer at Opera Software in Oslo, Norway, working on the desktop browser. At night he is a creative coder & demoscene artist specialized in real time audio visual animations in a few hundred bytes for the web platform, PC and Atari ST computers.
