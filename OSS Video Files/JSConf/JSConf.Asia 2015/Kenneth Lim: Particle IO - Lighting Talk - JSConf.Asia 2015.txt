my name is henna I'm I'm not hired by

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,809
particle I'm just a more active

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,170
community member working on the product

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,510
so I do some my fixes for the a common

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,970
lied to and stuff like that but I i I'm

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,800
a hardware guy so I don't really know

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,199
much about Java scream and stuff but I'm

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,750
gonna shave you guys what you can do so

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,969
I hope you guys can make use of the hard

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,579
way that you have they got you in the

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,440
registration so there's my hand dollar

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,660
name you can find in the forum as well

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,430
if you need more help so I'm just gonna

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,800
show you the hardware that we are gonna

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,100
work with oh sorry I forgot to mention

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,480
that mariko is an IOT company so this

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,079
all of the Internet of Things

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,750
development kit which is the middle of a

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,410
lot of API endpoints so you guys should

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,930
be very familiar with it so I can run

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,730
the device here because i think the

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,549
mighty puppy blocks the part that we

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,710
need to talk to so i'm gonna send it to

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,180
the device on the writing the one on the

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,670
right side that is running somewhere

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,740
else in my home okay so the two on the

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,180
left are like cellular versions but you

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,770
can spin too they're using the same

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:23,009
endpoint okay so um let me do the demo

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:25,189
so what I'm gonna do first it's let's

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,520
look at this one here so one of the

00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:32,520
developer for party co-wrote d-sub web

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,420
app basically so it shows you the let me

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,369
just refresh so it shows the devices

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,869
that are online my car right now so you

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:45,899
see three devices online and um let it

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,430
load so I guess you guys are familiar is

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,619
open source you can take a look at this

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,509
one so these are some of the functions

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,850
that are available the device that we

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,729
coded so you can call it based on an API

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,899
endpoint so let me give you an example

00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:00,329
so let's say I have two device running

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,090
now here so I want to know what's the

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,290
battery percentage left right now so i

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,290
just hit update here

00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:11,750
and your we get a value so the battery

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,790
is like ninety two percent right now so

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,260
everything is done by unaware if I know

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,940
you're not hot web developer you can

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,319
interact with a hardware device so

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,200
that's the beauty of using the

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,330
particular hardware key so let's do

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,580
something more interesting so I have a

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,739
code right now over here is using the

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,650
online web ide so what I'm gonna do is

00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:33,140
I'm gonna send this code publish it or

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,500
rather flashy to the device in my house

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,170
and it's gonna do a publish message

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,580
every 1.5 seconds so I guess you guys

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,269
are pretty familiar with the Popish

00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:49,070
subscribing in in your Chavez people so

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:50,930
let me just flash the code here so i got

00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,910
even sent to the server compound and

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,239
what sitcom pulse it sends over to the

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,340
device so it is our flesh successful

00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:02,510
they have a dash both feature here as

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:05,720
well so you see a series of servers SS

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,790
events so you can see right now over

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,579
here the device is actually publishing

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,160
the event so these are some things that

00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:17,269
you can do you can check out the

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,470
documentation as well so it's as things

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:22,250
that you guys are really familiar with

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:24,290
like API jason taylor coming back and

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,810
stuff like that so i hope you guys will

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,630
go home and explore the device play

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,579
around with it and do some cool stuff so

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,489
I'm some place that you can go to we

00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:36,200
have the forum so in the forum there's a

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,910
lot of like project sharing and stuff

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,220
like that you can go and get some

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,630
project ideas I'm going east of your

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,640
hardware body and get them to do

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,150
something for you and make something

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,739
interesting with JavaScript so I hope

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,090
you guys had a better understanding of

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,570
the highway there was even out the

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,920
innovation and hope you have some fun

00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,980
Thank You Kenneth

00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,980
