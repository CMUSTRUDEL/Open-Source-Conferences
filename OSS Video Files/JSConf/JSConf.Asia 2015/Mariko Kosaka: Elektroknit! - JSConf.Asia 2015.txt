Title: Mariko Kosaka: Elektroknit! - JSConf.Asia 2015
Publication date: 2016-01-02
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2015
Description: 
	Electroknit is a craft project to convert graphics into knitted patterns for an electric knitting machine. What does it take to turn a digital image into a physical object like a knitted sweater? The answer is series of image processing operations. As web engineer, we take it for granted that an img-tag displays an image because it is a "digital photo." Let's look at what "a Pixel" is & how you can manipulate for fun with Canvas API & JavaScript.

Mariko is an engineer who loves data and knitting. When she is not making software at Scripto, she uses code to help her design textiles & organize local JavaScript meetup in New York City called BrooklynJS.
