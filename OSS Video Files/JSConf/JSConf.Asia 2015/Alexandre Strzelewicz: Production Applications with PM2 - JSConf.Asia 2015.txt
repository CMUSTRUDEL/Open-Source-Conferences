Publication date: 2015-12-18
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2015
Description: 
	Once your application is developed, switching it to live production is a painful experience. From process management, deployment, monitoring, bug tracking, orchestration... a lot of techniques and methodologies must be taken into account to provide a quality application. This is where PM2 comes into the game, providing a framework to harden your Node.js application and super charge your production workflow.

Alexandre is a full stack JavaScript developer, technologist and the author of PM2, a well known process manager for production Node.js applications. He is also CEO & co-founder of the startup keymetrics.io, a supervizion solution built on top of PM2.
