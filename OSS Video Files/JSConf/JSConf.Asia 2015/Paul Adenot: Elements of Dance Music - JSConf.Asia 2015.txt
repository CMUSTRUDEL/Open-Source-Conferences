Title: Paul Adenot: Elements of Dance Music - JSConf.Asia 2015
Publication date: 2015-12-21
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2015
Description: 
	Sound in general is a pretty abstract topic for most people. How can one generate and arrange what is, at the end, a simple sum of sine waves going through the air, and make people move on a dance floor?
In this talk, we'll deconstruct a prototypical acid-techno track, by live-coding all the sounds (modeled after old analog gear), from scratch, using the Web Audio API.
We'll cover the basics of sound sequencing, synthesis, with an historical background. And then we'll dance.

Paul is an platform engineer at Mozilla, working on the Firefox web browser. He works on the Firefox Web Audio implementation, as well as the system audio code on all platforms. Sometimes help helps on WebRTC. He also co-edits the Web Audio API specification at the W3C, and dabbles in music production and cooking.
