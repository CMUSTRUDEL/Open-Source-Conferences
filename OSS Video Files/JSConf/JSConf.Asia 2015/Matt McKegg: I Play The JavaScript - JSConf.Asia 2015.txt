Description: 
	Find out how I use JavaScript to power my live electronic music performances. Come see (and hear) Web Audio, MIDI, and electron in action!

A JavaScript hacker and backyard musician and from Wellington, NZ. Lover of all things open and modular. I spend most of my time pressing buttons of various shapes, sizes and colours. Sometimes these buttons make sounds.
