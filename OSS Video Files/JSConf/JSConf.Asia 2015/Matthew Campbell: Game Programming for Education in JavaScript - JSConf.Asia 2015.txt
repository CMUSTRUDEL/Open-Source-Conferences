Title: Matthew Campbell: Game Programming for Education in JavaScript - JSConf.Asia 2015
Publication date: 2015-12-09
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2015
Description: 
	Ever want to make your own games? One weekend I decided to make a Thai typing game. This talk is my journey through building a game in JavaScript from scratch to releasing it into the AppStore. Then making native desktop versions of the game. Check this talk if your interested in gaming for education or just general game development programming in JavaScript.

Matthew builds JavaScript games for fun at night and during day he builds one page JavaScript apps with GO backends. He was a founder of Errplane and Langfight. Right now he is the lead for the largest Financial Instant Messenger at Thomson Reuters called EikonMessenger. He recently presented at GopherCon India, you can see the video and other blog posts of his on his homepage. Matthew also works on a book about Microservices in GO.

SVG is weird. It looks somehow familiar and can be handled similarly but it has its distinct differences and purpose from the technologies you know, like HTML and CSS. In this talk I want to share my experiences getting started, embedding and using SVG in modern web applications.

Seb is a frontend fanatic hailing from Belgium. He now lives in Singapore where he helps startups build browser-whipping web apps at Cofounders.sg and hosts the Front End Developers Singapore (FEDS) meetup.

00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,469
cold today my talks about it's called

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,210
serious gaming it's kind of about

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,690
building educational games and

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,380
JavaScript has anybody here ever built a

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,029
game in JavaScript even just for fun

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,730
cool there was like 10 people in the

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,380
audience that had done it it's fun

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,230
there's there's one guy going crazy so

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,360
it's good he sounds like he had some fun

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,800
with it yeah so kind of the main things

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,899
that I want to talk to you today is

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,260
about it's kind of a journey how over a

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,910
weekend I became a game developer and

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,140
how you guys too can become game

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,489
developers and make games for learning I

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:51,899
think I think there's not enough games

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:55,140
for actually learning stuff so about two

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,120
years ago I moved to Thailand and I

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,969
never spoke Thai I didn't know how to

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,550
read or write Thai I don't know anybody

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,470
here know how to read Thai there's like

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,040
two three okay there's a couple people

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,200
cool so I came and I come to this new

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,360
country and I'm like okay I'm gonna make

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,990
some friends and I want to start talking

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,670
to people and nowadays nobody calls each

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,830
other right we don't talk on the phone

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,100
we're always on like whatsapp or line or

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:28,020
Kakao chat or whatever and what I found

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,119
was I I wanted to talk to people and my

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,049
conversations always ended up like this

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,329
where you have these here - yeah where

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,670
all we do is we just send stickers to

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,549
each other like okay this is great like

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,560
okay I'm hungry I'm sad you know and you

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,659
can kind of get some of the way with

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,189
stickers but I really wanted to like

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:53,610
learn how to write and like how to type

00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:55,290
so what ended up happening was I just

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,439
like you know what I'm a programmer why

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,899
don't I just make a game to make myself

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,840
be able to learn Thai so I actually

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,399
built a Thai typing game well I first

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,049
went on the internet and there's been

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,360
like two typing games made in the last

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,509
ten years and they're both awful and I

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,049
was like I just can't be

00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:18,159
hard oh why do i why don't I try this

00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:19,500
out if you guys have ever seen well this

00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,200
is actually a picture of the game so

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,390
this is a copy of the game on iOS it's a

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,280
pretty simple game but it's it's kind of

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,250
a lot of fun and just a really quick way

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,230
to like incrementally grow tie and and

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,569
learn a keyboard and you may be asking

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,159
yourself why why is it difficult why why

00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:38,650
would you go through all this trouble of

00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,750
building your own app to like learn how

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,540
to write Thai well this is the Thai

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,349
alphabet and that's not two copies of

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:49,120
the same keyboard it's two keyboards so

00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:51,340
like you literally have to hit the meta

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,760
key to get some of the characters right

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,829
so like when I started typing I wasn't

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,750
hunting and pecking I was like sitting

00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:01,629
there for like five minutes like every

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:06,310
key press would be like I don't know

00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:08,560
where go guy is so I was like oh man

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,090
this this has to be better it has to be

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,879
better it has to be a better way to do

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:17,019
this and that's kind of what started my

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,310
journey building this game so just

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,790
really quick a little bit background

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,889
about me I'm a server-side developer I

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,480
mostly write go and you might be asking

00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:26,650
yourself why is a go developer here

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,819
talking about JavaScript

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,220
I love JavaScript and my main my main

00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,799
day job is writing server-side code so

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,540
like it's a nice like weekend thing to

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,910
write JavaScript particularly front-end

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,489
stuff you know just kind of totally

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,959
different element I have a book coming

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:46,120
out later this year called micro

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:52,599
services and go you should check it out

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:58,329
and yeah and I live in Bangkok cool how

00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:59,980
many people here are gamers yeah cool we

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,750
have a I figured there would be a lot of

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,090
people in the audience that are big

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,760
gamers and you know I mean there's a lot

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,530
of types of games right there's games

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,079
like World of Warcraft where you know

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,329
you're just you know you're grinding

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,979
you're doing things and people play

00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:16,870
World of Warcraft because it's fun it's

00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:19,180
social they get into it and like they

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,150
play with their friends but there's like

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,000
this huge spectrum of kinds of games so

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,890
I

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,260
I don't know if this game was really big

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,000
in Singapore but it's the number one

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,060
game in Thailand and it's it's a

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,590
Japanese cat game it's called neko

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:40,100
atsume and all you do is you put stuff

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:42,440
around and you collect cats and people

00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,720
spend hours playing this game and what's

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,440
crazy is there's no time it's only in

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,940
Japanese

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,440
there's no English subtitles or anything

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,570
but people have learned how to play this

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,910
game just because they think that it's

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,940
really fun and you'll see people on the

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,070
subway in Thailand almost spend like 30

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,100
minutes just playing this game and it

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,750
blows my mind and this game the only

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:08,680
thing I can think of it's just for time

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:11,660
wasting but I want to talk about it

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,220
something that I really what I'm really

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,730
passionate about which is serious gaming

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:20,090
and serious gaming is is building

00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,700
educational games for learning whereas

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,620
like when we when you know when we're

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,570
taught math as a kid you know like we do

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,790
our math facts and like we have to like

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,260
do the questions and the answers and

00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,060
we're like why can't we make this fun

00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,220
instead of just giving somebody a gold

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,190
sticker like why can't we actually make

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,560
an interactive game that like helps

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,630
people like learn how to do math or how

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,200
to read or do these kinds of things

00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:48,050
right and so when I was growing up we

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,330
had we had like Atari two's which I mean

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,400
Apple two's excuse me and we had lots of

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,870
really fun educational games and I don't

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,350
know what's happened because I feel like

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,460
they've kind of gone away and in a sense

00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,600
so like when I was growing up I don't

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,690
know it has anybody played any of these

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,890
games by the way yeah okay people

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,120
there's some older people here in the

00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:09,169
audience these these are really old

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,229
though there's like Oregon Trail and

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:14,060
Carmen Sandiego and math blasters and

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:16,190
the best one my favorite one was always

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,200
number munchers and it was just a game

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,570
that taught you multiplication in

00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,460
addition but you didn't think it was a

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,169
game you just played it because it was

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,810
fun and then all of a sudden you knew

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:30,020
all your multiplication tables it was

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,030
really kind of a crazy idea and but

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,340
there was like tons of these games and

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,110
they were really easy like these ran on

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,680
like one megahertz computer

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,569
it's like why can't we on the web now

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,180
remit games like this for kids like why

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:49,219
can't we make it fun for kids and people

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:51,680
to learn things and there's this kind of

00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:52,849
other area of gaming is gamification I

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,229
know a lot of people probably build

00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:56,650
business apps does anybody here use

00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:59,000
gamification like in their apps at all

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,419
not many actually just three or four

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,860
people okay so Gama fication is kind of

00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:06,439
like this thing that's come out over the

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,270
last years and I don't think is as

00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:11,719
effective at education but basically

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,490
Gama fication is we want to give rewards

00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:16,159
we want to give points we want to like

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,810
you check in you become a mayor like we

00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:19,190
have an app in America called Foursquare

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,400
where you check in and you become a

00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:29,029
mayor of a building and it's all around

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:31,490
points and games and I feel like it's

00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:33,289
fun but at a certain point if your bank

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,909
website gives you points for like

00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,259
checking your checking account at a

00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:38,029
certain point you're just going to get

00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:41,000
really bored with getting points on

00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:42,979
every single thing that you do and it's

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,270
really cool so I mean we do some of

00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:46,490
these kinds of things like you know you

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,199
still want to have like level ups and

00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,379
points and being able to show share to

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,360
your friends but I really think the

00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,190
future of educational gaming is about

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,310
making the games fun how do we make a

00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,289
world of warcraft that that teaches you

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,719
how to do geography or something like

00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:06,589
this like that that's what I really

00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:08,300
would like to see and and and the whole

00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:10,810
reason and obviously this is java

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,719
circumference so yes I am gonna get to

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:17,690
actual JavaScript programming so why

00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:19,039
JavaScript has has everybody read this

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,979
book by the way javascript the good

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,150
parts come on there should be more

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:25,069
people in the audience this is

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,659
absolutely the most important book

00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:28,580
you'll ever read on Java scale of

00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:32,750
analysis which guy and I look this is

00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:35,000
like one book that I love but why did I

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,789
pick JavaScript like you know like I've

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,070
done C++ a ton C sharp I've done all the

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,560
stuff I could write a native app and I

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,089
and I thought about it and I was like

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,130
well I wanted to build this in a weekend

00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:48,040
I wanted to just do this without any

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,740
trouble and just

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,660
wanted to do it fast and I was like this

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,930
is really the reason I did in JavaScript

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,769
is because every time I make a change in

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:01,449
my code that the app just reloads itself

00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:03,670
it's like interactive programming it's

00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:05,889
kind of like what they've always talked

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,170
about and having a good IDE is like um

00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:10,089
as I'm changing the code I like I have a

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,910
bigger monitor at home so I literally

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,290
just keep the app on one side and I keep

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,690
the JavaScript on the other and every

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,540
time my editor saves I actually use this

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,730
thing called I use this thing called

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,769
browser sync I don't know is anybody

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,190
here use browser sync or something

00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:27,040
similar

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,420
that's okay so this table over here is

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,649
like they raise their hand for

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,180
everything so they're probably very

00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:36,759
advanced or they like raising their

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:37,779
hands yeah so browser sync in gulp you

00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,060
should really check it out because

00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:42,550
basically for like 10 lines of code you

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,529
can point it at your your asset folders

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,000
and I even do like asset compilation

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,490
even if you're doing CoffeeScript or

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,079
whatever it will automatically just

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,660
reload the browser and what's cool is

00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,540
that it actually inserts JavaScript into

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,940
your HTML page and that javascript has

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,170
like notifications so like if something

00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,180
changes on the file system it actually

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,519
pings the code in the browser and

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,740
reloads the browser so like if you're

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,630
building a game what I do is I just like

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,310
disable all the menus and all this stuff

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:13,180
and I always just have the game levels

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:16,240
pop up so like as you're coding you're

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,579
like oh no that the the character he's

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,560
like 10 pixels too high well let me

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,149
change the 10 pixels and literally like

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,190
in a second you'll see that the 10

00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,839
pixels come down you know it's not like

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,630
if you guys have built like a game in

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,660
like C++ you're like okay well now I'm

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:34,000
gonna like recompile the whole thing and

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,860
I'm gonna wait five minutes and oh no I

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
didn't get it it wasn't 10 pixels it was

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,680
actually 12 pixels off stuff like this

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,959
so I think that was one of the biggest

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,339
things that like JavaScript there's no

00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,959
way I could have built this game in like

00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:54,819
three days the first version was

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:56,410
literally three days like so so this has

00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:58,300
kind of always been my sticking point

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,069
about JavaScript I don't know does

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,340
anybody hear fine like JavaScript

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:03,350
projects get pretty messy

00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,330
if they get really large like it just

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,820
kind of comes like this big bald mod of

00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,170
chaos a lot of times and like all of a

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,790
sudden you're in like this class and

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,310
it's actually attaching something to the

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,560
window that's used in like six classes

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:18,110
away and nobody knows because it was

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,700
written five years ago and like and this

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,990
has always been like my pain whenever

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,320
I've come into a lot of JavaScript

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,570
projects and I'm sure a lot of people

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,110
here are using it but I use this tool

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:32,510
called requirejs and requirejs lets you

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,600
do is like you make sure that each class

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:37,370
is kind of very separate and you kind of

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,560
you can you can kind of separate your

00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,740
different parts of the code very cleanly

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,200
so for a game games come out pretty

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,930
cleanly so like you know the hero is a

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,210
distinct class you know each monster is

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,440
a distinct class you know each kind of

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:56,300
level is a class even things like the

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,190
kinds of labels that we have like we

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,160
have special like scoring labels and

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,390
stuff like this and it really kind of

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,200
gave you a really nice way of

00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:07,580
structuring the whole program so it felt

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,500
a little bit more like being a

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,710
structured language like C++ or I'd you

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:18,700
go and and but still got to a lot of the

00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:21,110
speed and development of JavaScript so I

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,510
don't know if anybody's here if you've

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,460
looked at JavaScript game development

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:29,420
libraries when it when it came into this

00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:31,670
project I was like all right there has

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,250
to be nice game development library in

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:39,110
JavaScript so of course I go on Google

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:42,230
and I look and there's only 300 so this

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,300
should be easy to pick from so I think I

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,040
got by by about the third one I was just

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,340
like all right I think it's just faster

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,680
just to pick it and start programming so

00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,330
I don't have like a huge extensive

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,820
knowledge of all of them I tried a

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,490
couple like impact GS but it ended up

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,320
with this one called create GS and

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,360
what's kind of cool is it's written by

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,050
some guys that used to do flash this guy

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,910
game G Skinner and since he was a flash

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,890
developer he kind of had all the ideas

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,170
about what are the core elements of like

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,330
building interactive applications you

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,120
know like you know like how do I make

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,370
things anime

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,310
how do I have like transitions how do I

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:23,220
have tweens and and just really just

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,779
very small core building blocks it

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,220
doesn't try to be like I don't know if

00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,839
you've seen other game libraries where

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,690
they're like you know you end up just

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,300
making JSON files to control levels or

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,400
if you use like unity maybe you like try

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,260
to like use some GUI app like it's it's

00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,400
just like the bear kind of fundamentals

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,990
that you would need and since not a lot

00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,750
of people have actually built games here

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:48,950
I'm gonna kind of talk about really the

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:52,320
small fundamentals of building a game

00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,960
just a 2-d game you know this is like

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,360
all Mario area stuff so like it's not

00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,260
advanced and it's really easy and it's

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,970
kind of fun so kind of the one of the

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,580
the main building blocks of a game is

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,320
you have that animations right so we

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,029
have you know we have monsters in the

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,920
game and we have the characters and

00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:12,240
basically what boils down is you have

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,390
these things and they're called sprite

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,610
sheets you know they can be cells or

00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:20,790
whatever but basically what happens is

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,070
you have like a giant horizontal image

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,400
so like each one of these five things

00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:28,650
here is one image and basically you

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,990
break down the frames of the image into

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,670
like separate blocks so if it's by 40 by

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,400
40 you're lining it up and you say like

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,950
40 and then at 80 pixels there's the

00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:43,320
second pixel picture and at 120 pixels

00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:45,600
there's a third picture right so as you

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,250
do these but what's also cool is you

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,870
might have multiple different animations

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,510
in one file so like if we look at the

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,730
monster there we have we have two we

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,070
have two animations we have one where

00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:00,630
he's like chomping and then we have one

00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:02,700
where he's dying and and we look at the

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,160
each of them we have like but sometimes

00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,110
we might so not whereas like on the

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,490
third one down we just have one long

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:14,029
really really long animation so we can

00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,560
kind of mix these up how we want and

00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:19,890
what's kind of cool is the code is

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,570
really easy for this so like we're

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:25,860
looking at the monster we're actually

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,329
looking at one of the monkeys and in the

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,680
framework all you're doing is you're

00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:33,750
defining which frames go

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:37,350
each animation so you say like frames 0

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,180
1 2 3 4 5 go to the run and you can even

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,279
reuse them so sometimes maybe the jump

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,380
share some of the run animations and

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:47,310
then you can just and you just set up

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:50,339
names and then we just create a hero

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,990
with the sprite sheet and you place them

00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,149
on the screen and that's as simple as

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,500
creating animations and when you want to

00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:57,779
play it so like let's say that we're

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,440
playing through the game and we kill the

00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:03,810
monster right to actually just kill the

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,630
monster to run the animation you run one

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,459
line of code and it's just it's called

00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,140
go to and stop so it runs the animation

00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:13,050
and us to the end of the animation and

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,480
it's that simple like it's 15 lines of

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,160
code to set up an animation and to place

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,080
it on the screen and then one line of

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,630
code every time you want to play it so

00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,940
it's it's about as simple as it can get

00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,430
and and that's kind of one of the things

00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,920
that I want to kind of convey through

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,140
this whole thing is basically it's

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,970
pretty easy like it seems daunting like

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,670
you see games and like you don't have to

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,770
make like 3d unreal game like there's a

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,300
lot of fun two teams it's like the cat

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,430
game we showed earlier it isn't it

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,570
there's no like advanced technology that

00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:47,459
could have been made on a Super Nintendo

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:50,910
you know so kind of the next building

00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,990
block that we have in kind of 2d and 2d

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,330
game programming it's called the

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,860
parallax scrolling and this is kind of

00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,900
like if you ever played Super Mario

00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,760
Brothers I don't know is how many people

00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,800
I don't know if that's too old in this

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,180
audience okay okay cool

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,179
actually half more than half the

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:09,959
audiences play this good so basically

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,579
the whole idea of Super Mario is Mario

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,740
doesn't really move that much it's

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,449
really the background of the screen that

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,760
moves so I just want to really quickly

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:20,459
show so like this is actually the game

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,470
right so like this is this is actually

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,929
all those elements put together inside

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,850
of one of the levels in the game but if

00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:28,740
we break it down into pieces it's really

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:31,860
four different graphics that are really

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,350
wide and kind of the idea with a

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,870
parallax is that you have different

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:39,900
parts of the screen and they move at

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:41,830
different speeds so the clouds might be

00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,540
moving really slow

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,460
the city scene might be moving very

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,080
quickly and then the middle city scene

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,660
might be moving just a little bit slower

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,720
and then the ground just barely moves

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,580
right and it creates this effect as

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,960
though you're walking through the screen

00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,460
but all you're doing is you're just kind

00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,590
of you're just shifting different

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,480
elements and what's kind of cool is that

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,030
it ends up being like a circle so like

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,550
the clouds we don't have infinite number

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:09,100
of clouds right we're just basically

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:11,020
circling around a circle so we like are

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,700
just showing a portion of the clouds at

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,340
any pour it's important the time so

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,660
maybe like on this screen here we might

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,150
be showing maybe a quarter of those

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,320
clouds especially on iOS where you're

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,210
not gonna you don't have that much

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,730
resolution so you as you can see we're

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,980
only seeing like a very very very small

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,260
fraction of each piece but it kind of

00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,120
moves around and it kind of gives the

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:36,130
impression is that that you're really

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:39,160
kind of moving through this city soon so

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:42,640
let's let's talk about the code and once

00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:46,360
again this is really easy so basically

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:49,000
for parallax you basically are just for

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,840
each one you give it a name you give it

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,120
the dimensions and you give it the speed

00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,470
the rate that it's going to be moving so

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,840
some are going to be moving at you know

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,370
point so many milliseconds and each one

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,400
will be moving at different milliseconds

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:08,410
and then the actual implementation of

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,290
parallax itself is only ten lines of

00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:14,860
code in JavaScript you're basically just

00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:17,320
taking the velocity and you're basically

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,050
just moving it around the x-axis at the

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,570
velocity that it needs to go so like and

00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:25,330
if it loops around we just start over

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:27,970
from the beginning so it's it's it's

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,800
really really easy it didn't even have a

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,210
parallax implementation I just got this

00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,700
off the internet I was like ten lines of

00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:37,420
code it was it it's it's really fun

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,460
though so now we have kind of the main

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,680
building blocks of like a 2d game like

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,140
we can we have the characters we can

00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,580
make big characters animate and move and

00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,860
we can move the background as though

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,750
we're walking through the screen now how

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,440
does the main game loop work in a game

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:55,460
so kind of games are kind of built

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,760
around state machines

00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,890
so basically what happens is every time

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,720
there's a clock tick so usually you'll

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,210
divide a game into like 60 frames a

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,070
second or 30 frames a second and you'll

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,530
have an event which is your clock tick

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:13,700
in create yes they called the update

00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:16,280
function and once every so like if we

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,950
have 60 frames a second so once a what

00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,040
once every one 60th of a second will get

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:24,470
an event and basically what we'll do is

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,450
we'll decide at that point in time if we

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,640
need to do an animation or maybe we need

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,050
to scroll the screen some and and

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,150
basically we're just doing it a

00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:36,710
fractions fractions in fractions of a

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:38,150
second and the main game loop as you can

00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:41,540
see here you can maybe I can't see the

00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,920
code gray but it's only maybe about 50

00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,300
lines of code and we'll just kind of

00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,760
talk through just kind of the main

00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:50,090
elements of how how a game loop actually

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,730
works so like as I said it's a state

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,650
machine so like for example if somebody

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,480
hit the pause button the function

00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:59,570
shouldn't do anything right so it starts

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,210
there and then if if we're in the middle

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,040
of a monster dying so like an event so

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,930
like a monster dies well that's not

00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,720
instantaneous right because it may take

00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:11,090
a second it may take a half a second for

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,860
the animation to play through so you

00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:15,950
have to keep you have to maintain these

00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:18,050
states and you have to see if we're if

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:22,520
we're done yet with each of these kinds

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:24,740
of states and then for each kind of

00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,750
thing on the screen now it's granted

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:30,230
like this is a pretty simple game so

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:32,300
like I explicitly mention each monster

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,680
and each hero like if you're building a

00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,830
bigger game you would have like a linked

00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,300
list or a map of like all of the all the

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,730
objects that you would have on the

00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,050
screen and you would iterate over them

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,540
but basically what you're gonna do is

00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,970
you talk to each object and you tell the

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,880
object to render itself and and

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:53,030
basically in in like the hero or in the

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,670
monster they know about time so the hero

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:58,330
he's running so like every so often

00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:01,520
he'll be changing frames of his run or

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,890
if it's the monster he'll have to be

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,010
checking to see if the hero intersects

00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,120
with with the box so like if the monster

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:11,240
and the hero touchy

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,250
the hero dies shame these kinds of

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,039
things so each of these classes is like

00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:18,529
responsible for its own for its own

00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:22,159
functionality and it kind of breaks in

00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:24,559
like that so then yeah so so and then

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,900
yes then there's the collided so we

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:30,679
might do things we play an audio we

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:33,409
might lower the health and for our game

00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,440
since we're building something that

00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:38,299
actually is tracking words per minute

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,580
we're gonna start calculating the words

00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:43,010
per minute and update any labels so like

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:46,130
we have labels on the screen if I come

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:48,169
back here we have that's yeah we have

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:51,080
labels on the screen like the time the

00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:52,730
words per minute how many points we have

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,380
and we have to kind of keep track of

00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,110
those and like every time we do an

00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,360
update and then the very last thing is

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:02,659
we iterate over all the parallax layers

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,279
that we talked about earlier and we we

00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:06,500
make sure that they get updated so like

00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:08,870
we just talked to the parallax which we

00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,149
talked about here and the parallax knows

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,919
how to render itself what's kind of cool

00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:15,289
is like the main game loop just kind of

00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:16,730
knows about objects and then each object

00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:18,380
is kind of responsible for its own

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,270
rendering it's kind of very similar to

00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,950
like when you guys do like angular or

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,500
any of these other component frameworks

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,720
but now we can do this with like games

00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,960
and it's it's pretty straightforward if

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,750
you've done any kind of other game

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,059
development so that's kind of the main

00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,130
glue that's that's basically all the

00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:39,320
main things you need to like break down

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,630
a game and we've talked about maybe 150

00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,940
lines of code for the core of a 2-d game

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,039
that's that's pretty reasonable for

00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,370
anybody starting out to just like flip

00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,720
through right so cool so I'm going to

00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,240
talk about some of the other cool fun

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,000
libraries that I found for doing game

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,549
development with with this there's

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,440
another library called creatine and once

00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:01,940
you start to get a more complex game

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,679
like so once I started to have multiple

00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,390
levels and stuff I wanted to be able to

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,330
like actually manage the levels in a

00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:10,360
sane way and this creatine framework

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:13,309
allows you to do like level management

00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,919
transitions between levels it can even

00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:18,049
do things like did anybody play like the

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,210
old Final Fantasies were like you have

00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:22,430
like this 2d yeah

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,680
plantain yeah I see a couple of people

00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,300
smiling so like the old Final Fantasy

00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,640
games were all they call it I so more

00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,310
Trek Norfolk where you're looking at a

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,230
you're looking at an overworld and you

00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,700
move through this overworld and it has

00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,900
kind of cool things for that so if you

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,540
guys are like if anybody's thinking

00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,510
about like building like a 3d like not

00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,880
3d but like a like an old-style RPG like

00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,530
there's classes where like you just spin

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,970
up and you just give it some graphics

00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:48,050
and all of a sudden you have like an

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:53,330
old-style

00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:55,940
RPG like right out of the box so I'll

00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,400
talk about kind of what I ended up using

00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,130
it for I ended up using it for managing

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,900
levels and what's really cool is like

00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,420
they have this thing called the level

00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,310
manager in the directory and you

00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,530
basically you set up all your types of

00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,930
levels and you can even make things like

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,240
the main the main entry screen to the

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,850
application and the settings screen are

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,400
kind of levels and you can shift between

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,900
them so like you can kind of make them

00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,790
you can almost think of it it's like if

00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,920
it was like divs of different pages and

00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:27,680
you're replacing them it just handles

00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,960
like transitioning like like say if we

00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,240
want to transition like ever every after

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,160
every level you want to have a level

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,570
complete right so you want to transition

00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,430
into a level complete and then

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,530
transition into the next type of level

00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,480
and is this kind of framework just kind

00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,400
of gives you a really easy way of

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,110
handling that and keeping that and a

00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,530
nice clean kind of more object-oriented

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:50,300
fashion so there was a whole talk on

00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,830
this which is great I hope everybody

00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,900
heard the talk this morning which was

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,780
really great how many people are

00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,060
actually using PhoneGap or cordova for

00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,400
production stuff that's cool there's

00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,600
actually quite a bit of people yeah it's

00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,790
really exciting like if you haven't

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,400
checked it out and you might be like

00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,480
well what why did you build an HTML game

00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,950
and then why do you need to produce

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,150
cordova why don't you just put it on the

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,250
web wouldn't that be awesome

00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,920
so I started off and I was like oh this

00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,360
is awesome I built it on OSX I built the

00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,580
whole app in a weekend I was like oh

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,250
this is really cool and I don't really

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,450
typed I on my OS X I always type on my

00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,820
phone because I'm always talking with my

00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,900
friends if I'm talking inside and I was

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,510
like ah cool I'm just gonna throw this

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,210
on iOS it's gonna be no problem like of

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,180
course I throw it on there in like 95

00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,040
percent of it work

00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,810
right and it's like this is always the

00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,490
one thing that always is annoying with

00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:41,910
JavaScript there's always like that last

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,470
couple percent so there was a couple

00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:45,870
issues that when I ran to and I

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:49,770
originally put it on iOS so things like

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:51,660
the native keyboard so one of the things

00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,890
is a lot of typing games if you look on

00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,570
the App Store I don't know if anybody's

00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,340
ever played they make their own fake

00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,310
keyboards which is really annoying

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,690
because I like the iOS keyboard and I

00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,010
really want to learn how to type on that

00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,930
I don't want to learn how to type on a

00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,810
fake keyboard so if you want to actually

00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:09,480
control the iOS keyboard for good reason

00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:12,780
Safari doesn't let you control how it

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,280
pops up and stuff like this so this is

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,010
one of the things that you actually have

00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,810
to go to native code for and and

00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:22,200
actually be able to handle the the

00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:24,060
popups the other thing was there were

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,140
certain times where the whole game would

00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:29,820
just pause on iOS in Safari like when

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,470
you are playing there's like sometimes

00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,030
when you're playing sounds or sometimes

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,410
when you're using the keyboard like the

00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,360
game would just like it would just pause

00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,760
and there was just like nothing you

00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,200
could do so these were the kinds of

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,590
things that like I ended up using

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,880
Cordova for and ended up being really

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,200
easy I thought it was gonna be hard

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,970
because they were like oh you can build

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,950
native code and I hadn't hadn't used it

00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,420
before and I was like I'll cool I've

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,830
done objective-c I'm gonna write all

00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,870
this objective-c and then I go on the

00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,670
internet and I find that everything that

00:27:54,870 --> 00:28:00,360
I ever wanted possibly was already

00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:01,680
written in Cordova plugins so so you

00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,510
don't have to worry about doing

00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,120
Objective C or Java if you're doing an

00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:09,030
Android app so for example I used two

00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,920
plugins from Cordova one in one of them

00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,540
is the keyboard plug-in which allows you

00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,460
to have like manual control of the

00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,700
keyboard so you can actually like force

00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,050
the keyboard to pop up and do things the

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,410
other really cool thing that they have

00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:24,030
in Cordova is background audio so like

00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,800
the audio actually plays on a background

00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,170
thread and it doesn't interrupt your

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,820
JavaScript so like there's times like

00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,280
when you're playing like like sound

00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,830
loops where like Safari was pausing I

00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,440
was having issues with this and like as

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:40,440
soon as I put it in Cordova and the

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,270
really other nice thing about it is it's

00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,550
runtime in a like you can just check it

00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,810
at runtime so like if I run this app on

00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,500
my on my laptop

00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,690
it doesn't use

00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,640
Cordova and it just checks and it just

00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,650
uses the native browser audio function

00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,360
so it's it's really easy to kind of

00:28:53,650 --> 00:29:00,250
integrate it into your apps like just

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:02,590
piecemeal this is fun I saw I just got

00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,030
this about a week ago I don't know has

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:08,410
anybody got in to play with electron yet

00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:10,990
it's quite new it's okay for people good

00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:13,630
awesome so electron is kind of like the

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,960
new hotness it's kind of like the next

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:19,120
PhoneGap it's by the github guys and

00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,030
basically it allows you to build native

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,400
applications in JavaScript both on OS X

00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:26,700
and Windows it's not more it's not for

00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,630
mobile as much it's more for desktops

00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,150
but what's kind of cool is that it

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:34,870
packages Chrome with your JavaScript

00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:36,430
application so like kind of annoying

00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:39,430
because like on iOS you always have to

00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:41,380
have Safari and I I personally like

00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,850
coding in Chrome better than Safari so

00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,650
like my app always just works better in

00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,630
chrome so this this is kind of cool and

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,190
the other nice thing is if you want to

00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,780
package it up for the Mac App Store or

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,360
the Windows app store you can actually

00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:55,240
create a binary to distribute with your

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,860
application and I thought oh man this is

00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,170
gonna be a pain in the neck this is

00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:02,770
gonna be like all this hard stuff to set

00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:05,800
it up and it I turned out like you write

00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,810
one javascript file and you write like

00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,720
40 lines of code in the JavaScript file

00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,950
and that's it and you're done and

00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,810
basically all the code is is you're just

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:16,570
defining how large you want the window

00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,460
to be and like defining if you want it

00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,040
to be fullscreen or not and it's just

00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,840
this really really simple stuff and and

00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,120
in like five minutes you guys can have

00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,890
like a native OSX app and it looks like

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,590
an app and what's cool is you can have

00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,360
like the nice icons and stuff like that

00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,180
so it looks like it's like the native

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,770
OSX apps in fact I spent more time just

00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,730
trying to get code signing to work on

00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,680
OSX which is a real pain like to do that

00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:46,570
to get in the Mac App Store like that

00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:48,580
was that was a bigger nightmare so I'm

00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:51,640
gonna give you a demo of this code but I

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:56,020
just wanted to wrap up and kind of bring

00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,610
back a couple points I'm I don't use

00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,500
JavaScript for my day-to-day work but

00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:01,120
making a game in JavaScript was really

00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:05,169
easy

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,059
I think you know I would avoid the

00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:09,370
cross-platform tools honestly unless you

00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:11,890
really have a need like I had a need to

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:14,740
use him I spent more time futzing with

00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:19,510
couldn't with PhoneGap then I would have

00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:21,370
liked and its really easy to get going

00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,470
in a game writing a game in JavaScript

00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:26,950
literally over a single weekend you can

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:29,860
put together a game no problem

00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:31,450
so I I really encourage it I would love

00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,000
to see some games for kids

00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:36,130
i I I want to make some games around

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,019
math like this is kind of what I want to

00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:43,889
do this is all open source it's on my

00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:46,750
github which I forgot to put a link to

00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:49,149
but if you if you hit me up afterwards

00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,279
also to you and if you want to pack it

00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:53,320
if you want to make a Chinese version or

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,389
a Korean version I kind of want to do a

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,090
Japanese one next because I'm learning

00:31:55,389 --> 00:32:02,559
Japanese but I would love to see some

00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:04,450
other people hack on it and I'm going to

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,250
do a little bit of demo because we have

00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,870
a few more minutes and then then I'll

00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:18,700
open up for questions in a few minutes

00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:19,870
so cool it's just nice so basically what

00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,299
I was talking about at the beginning of

00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:26,399
the presentation where I use gulp and

00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:29,380
Bowser jams so basically I just run gulp

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:36,659
and it sets up the entire environment

00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:38,889
and it runs the app here actually I

00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,510
don't have a Thai keyboard on this

00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:46,389
laptop so I'm gonna actually just change

00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:47,980
this to English for now I it's funny

00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:49,570
when I was developing the game I didn't

00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,220
I couldn't type Thai fast enough to

00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:55,120
actually develop the game so I had to

00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,710
put an English mode in cuz because

00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,000
otherwise I was like I could never get

00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:06,429
to the end of the level it was really

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:10,440
bad it's really funny yeah so so what's

00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:10,440
kind of cool is I want to just

00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,830
so what's cool is now since we're in

00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,570
JavaScript obviously we have our normal

00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,390
JavaScript console and everything like

00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:23,120
this now there are some things missing

00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,460
right cuz this is just a giant canvas so

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,530
we can't like do introspections so like

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,780
if we inspect the element really we just

00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,160
have a giant canvas right we're just cuz

00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,380
we're just doing 2d bleeding we're not

00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,750
actually using HTML elements at all of

00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,910
this I mean it's almost like making a

00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,130
game on a console and in that kind of

00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:42,049
sense but what's cool is like now that

00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,000
we're in JavaScript we can actually do

00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:45,799
things like we can look at we can

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,080
inspect elements on the stage and stuff

00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:54,890
like this let me go so like for example

00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,990
if we wanted to change the word in the

00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:58,040
middle of the the running we can do nice

00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:04,040
things like this so we can actually

00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:09,040
check it and and this is I love this

00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:09,040
workflow so let me get at it full screen

00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:16,589
so yeah so my development workflow is

00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,809
like this where and if you have two

00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:20,429
monitors obviously I found this so much

00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:22,739
better because I used to like to hack on

00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:25,200
games in C++ when I was much younger and

00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,940
this was always a nightmare cuz you

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,759
would like you would want to tweak

00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,589
things so like you don't have a GUI

00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:33,419
editor right so like if you wanted like

00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:36,269
if the monster is like offset by ten

00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:38,129
pixels you don't have any way of like

00:34:36,269 --> 00:34:39,629
easily doing that you have to change the

00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:43,109
code right it's like every time you

00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:47,279
wanted to change the code so you know if

00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:50,879
I wanted to make the monster like jump

00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:55,549
here and we that we could actually just

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,549
change it and see if that

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,970
it's not good yeah so it just makes it

00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:10,869
really easy so this is I really like

00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:13,250
this workflow and I'm going to show you

00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:16,160
there's only a couple thousand lines of

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:20,300
code in this whole project and it gets

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:23,000
broken out pretty easily so that's

00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:27,349
that's pretty much it I'm gonna open it

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,950
up for a few questions now yes thanks

00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:37,010
Matthew

00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:40,340
so any questions for Matthew so what the

00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:42,460
artwork for the game oh um I have a

00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:45,380
designer friend

00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:47,630
yeah that's oh but what's cool is

00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,359
there's actually a lot of open source

00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:53,240
game artwork especially if you're

00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:56,180
building 2d games I don't have the links

00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,230
handy but if you just google to the open

00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,820
source there's actually a huge

00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:02,599
communities because a lot of people like

00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:07,310
to remake the old RPGs like the Final

00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,839
Fantasy type games yeah okay yeah

00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,880
question is there like a framework

00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:13,130
that's react based for game because this

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,400
seems like a really good you know demo

00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:18,109
or the use case yeah I don't know of one

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,369
that react but see the thing is is that

00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,380
I don't know if you would need to

00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:24,140
because a lot of the stuff in like react

00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:26,599
or angular are built around HTML

00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,730
elements and this is like you're

00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:31,040
building a canvas like it's it's kind of

00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,290
like you're just doing 2d bleeding so

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,050
like I don't know if it would help you

00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:43,760
as much as you would think there's not a

00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:48,230
whole lot to it actually solution or you

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,609
just write a hole for the text one for

00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,130
though say that one more time no

00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:52,910
collision oh for the localization oh

00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,980
well

00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,500
localization happened to be easy because

00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,570
I live in Thailand so I have lots of

00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:04,940
people that speak Thai around me so I

00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:06,560
got it for free it was pretty oh if you

00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,810
want to you want to localize the game

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,790
yeah so the way the way you would just

00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,560
do the localization is pretty easy just

00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:14,210
like any other JavaScript app I would

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,460
probably just have a map

00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,020
of strings and the way I've always done

00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,290
it is just have a map of strings and I

00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:24,170
just swap out this strings

00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:27,430
nothing fancy or different in a game yes

00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:29,390
from the last road sorry the performance

00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,460
when it was released how was the

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:33,890
performance on the devices Oh

00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:37,820
so I mean performance wise like were you

00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:40,310
getting 60fps or was it yet so the when

00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,630
I first wrote it I didn't even try it on

00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,490
the device and when I first ran in on

00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,350
device it was 60 frames a second until

00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:48,620
it's popped until it was 0 frames a

00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:49,820
second but once what happened is I ended

00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,040
up figuring out there are certain

00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,710
trigger points in Safari like when you

00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,390
talk to the keyboard like it would just

00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,950
pause the whole thread and that was the

00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,960
main thing was just getting around these

00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:03,110
there's a couple bumps where it would

00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,060
but like on an iPhone either five or six

00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:07,870
is the main ones I've tested it's 60

00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:11,180
frames a second with almost no tuning so

00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:13,790
right so I guess what you men show

00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,950
before you can use the console like the

00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:19,940
JavaScript console or the chrome console

00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:22,940
to modify things so in a way it makes

00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:27,800
people possible to hack your games is

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:29,900
there a way to yeah okay so the question

00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,790
is is it's cuz it's a JavaScript can

00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,040
people hack the game yeah of course but

00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:36,650
that's kind of fun I kind of like that's

00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,080
why I liked how the script is cuz like

00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,280
if somebody wanted to tweak it like you

00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,590
know sometimes I was finding something

00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,120
annoying you could like skip a level in

00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,500
the game right it's kind of like when

00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,990
you're a kid and they had like the cheat

00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,190
codes for the game but in this the cheat

00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:52,760
codes are you actually learn something

00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:55,400
so I mean I think it would be very

00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,810
difficult to stop right the only thing

00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,340
you could really do is try to make it

00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,260
something on the server side if you had

00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:06,590
a server-side game but yeah I don't

00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:09,380
think you can stop it completely make

00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:11,480
sure that is fun while staying simple

00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,860
right oh that's that's a great question

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,140
how do you make sure that the game is

00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,130
fun well simple and that's why I think

00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,710
you got to throw away a lot of

00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:20,330
prototypes so when we originally made

00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,560
this I'd made that we were making this

00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,900
with a graphic designer friend of mine

00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,540
and what we did was we ended up taking

00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,010
like ten different

00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:30,680
versions actually I would like to show

00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:33,050
we had tender we had ten different like

00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,600
iterations we did in just like Photoshop

00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:37,520
and we just played around we were like

00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,980
okay would this work would this work and

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,090
we didn't even write any code and even

00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,010
if you don't do Photoshop I would just

00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:45,200
do it on paper and like just go through

00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:47,060
different concepts because like we came

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,470
through I mean this isn't even that

00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,570
complex of a game but we went through

00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:56,720
early ten different ones that just won't

00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:58,750
make any sense at all all right Thank

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,010
You Matthew
