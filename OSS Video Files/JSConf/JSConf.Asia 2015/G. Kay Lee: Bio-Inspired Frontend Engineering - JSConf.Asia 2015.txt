Title: G. Kay Lee: Bio-Inspired Frontend Engineering - JSConf.Asia 2015
Publication date: 2015-12-20
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2015
Description: 
	Life on Earth has existed for at least 3.5 billion years, and more than ⅔ of that time was spent on perfecting the cell into the fundamental universal component of life that subsequently empowered the explosive evolution of complex multicellular organisms.
This talk will draw ideas from one of the most miraculous structures of our Universe - one which has withstood eons of evolution - and show you the striking resemblance between a cell and an instance object. This newly gained insight will point us to a new approach to class composition other than traditional mixins or traits. We’ll then implement this mechanism using advanced language constructs in ES2015 and beyond, and see how it may help to catalyze the Cambrian explosion of next generation JavaScript apps.
After studying chemistry and molecular biology and working as a telescope operator on Mauna Loa trying to be astrophysical, the adventurous journey of G. Kay Lee is now on hiatus since he has found his inner tranquility in being a frontend artisan. He’s one of the coorganizers of AngularJS.tw, the author of ngStorage, a proponent of ES2015+, and a staff engineer at KKBOX.

Thanks ok hello everyone today we are

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:22,109
going to talk about bio inspired from

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:24,330
engineering so I'm Kylie I've been doing

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:28,439
from and engineering for more than help

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,040
a decade so this is my the link to my

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,059
github profile you can follow this link

00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,170
actually I've been trying to get into

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,879
the twitter thing but and you know I I

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,620
wasn't very too successful so if you are

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,180
interested to follow me on twitter you

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,340
can use the same hand though it's just

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,980
it's the same but i'm not going to

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,989
injury included here just in case you're

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:55,620
interested so i'm currently working as a

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:58,170
staff engineer a kkbox IQ in taiwan and

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,710
doing a sort of you know from n and

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,220
javascript stuff and now i'm not sure it

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,320
is also common place for everyone's home

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,900
country but here in taiwan a good

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,360
portion of them from engineers in the

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,150
industry aren't you know i'm coming from

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,200
a computer science background so

00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:21,990
including me so just being curious well

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,299
we are added so how many of you aren't

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,100
coming from a traditional computer

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,780
science background please raise your

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:36,000
hand please just in curious it's like um

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:39,630
a dozen or more people and okay so it's

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,020
not it's not a lot of people so maybe

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:48,119
I'm you know I'm not a common people and

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,430
I don't know so okay well just like like

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,649
I've said before I'm not coming from a

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,840
computer science background my academic

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,409
background is actually having nothing to

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,180
do with computer science at all so

00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:03,390
actually I used to be a telescope

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,000
operator um manalo are in the Big Island

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,250
of Hawaii so it's not a very big

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,610
telescope either is a radio telescope

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,470
and we're trying to you know observe

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,960
some cryptic

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,690
properties of the microwave background

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,150
radiation so it's not very interesting

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:24,240
but I have a long-standing passion for

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,630
astronomy since my youth actually I'm

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,840
and giving my school years Mike timid

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:34,590
years i'm starting chemistry and biology

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,650
molecular biology cellular biology and

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,870
so on so i would not say they are

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,320
interesting but they can be enchanting

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:48,870
at links so you may be wondering that

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:51,450
like astronomy chemistry biology these

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,640
things sounds totally different again

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,670
there are you may think they're

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,640
unrelated to each other but actually I'm

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,520
trying to let you know that all of them

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,150
are like becomes a beacon of light point

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,400
into some of the archaic making the most

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,290
ancient and most profound questions for

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,850
us human being since the dawn of

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,590
civilizations so you may not notice yet

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,800
but they also have some striking

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:23,400
resemblances in places that you may have

00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,440
yet to discover so maybe you would think

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,989
that this claim is very in like you

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:33,209
beers unbelievable but after all you

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,760
will see because while you may think

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,850
that the differences is astronomical

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,070
versus atomic home you know how can they

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:46,410
be you know how can I share any

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:49,200
resemblance is how could it be well it's

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,260
not only orders of magnitude apart we

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,940
are basically talking about two very

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,780
different ends on the scale of our

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,880
universe right so how could that be any

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:03,060
calculate here any kind of responses you

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,950
know so let's take a look at this

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:11,390
picture you know this background picture

00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,390
what is it what does it look like to you

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:19,500
does it look like a group of cultured

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:23,729
cells on the package or maybe it's like

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,259
a representation of our neural network

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,880
in a brain

00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:31,919
now that the answer is the real answer

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:35,590
is this is a computer simulation of the

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,710
Prairie based on real observational data

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:41,699
that's the very large structure of our

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,900
universe it's the largest known

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,759
structuring out your universe we are

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:51,030
calling it like a full amount of our

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:53,919
universe so as you can see our our

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,479
galaxy's you know that skitter doesn't

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,259
really scatter around the universe

00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:02,020
layout you know they sit down certain

00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:03,909
filaments along a straight a string a

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,310
straight line and there's nothing

00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:12,360
between it's just boy nothing else so

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:15,539
the simulated similarities in the

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,889
visuals not mere coincidence actually

00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:21,069
scientists are saying that there may be

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:24,400
some system dynamics that we haven't yet

00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:28,900
fully understand having been in play

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,180
here and you know this may be a more

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,930
in-depth research into this area may

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:39,099
show some you know unknown science so

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:43,630
let's take a look at another example so

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:46,900
here's something yeah it looks like an

00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:50,940
embryo you know in very early stage

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:53,699
embryo now we actually have a

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:57,460
specialized turn for the symbology

00:05:53,699 --> 00:06:01,240
ice-coated Maaloula so it's immortalized

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:05,020
a fertilized egg undergoing a few splits

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:09,669
like from a single cell with you like 16

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:12,789
or 20 or 30 two cells you know this is a

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:15,550
very early stage of a single life it's

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:17,259
only a few days after fertilization so

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,900
it looks like because it looks like the

00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:22,270
memories so it's called a morula okay

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,599
you say let let him freeze now

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,639
apparently this is not a fertilized egg

00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,159
this is not a very well so I'm not

00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,669
otherwise I won't be showing here so

00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:35,110
it's actually a planet planetary nebula

00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,540
code asked

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:41,860
nebula it's a few thousand light-years

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:44,530
away from the earth so ironically this

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,770
planetary nebula or should I say every

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:51,820
planetary nebula is formed at the end

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:55,600
stage of a time star so comfortably

00:06:51,820 --> 00:07:00,970
counter into two to the early stage in

00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:04,960
brio well so when a red giant reaches

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:08,560
the end of its life spin it will kind of

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,100
like just explode well actually it's not

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,290
explosion but the actual kinds of

00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,450
pushing the other show of it of itself

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,360
into the interest level there are steps

00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:22,870
space and these materials will get

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,570
ionized they will form the nebula you

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:29,350
see here and in a core will like

00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:31,240
condensed into a white dwarf and the

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,780
white dwarf will be left alone in a

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:39,790
space and undergoing a eternity of

00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:42,400
thermodynamic death so and this this

00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:45,940
chem is that this is the very real part

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,550
of the central star of this planetary

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,400
nebula and this will also be the fat of

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,820
our very own son so you know this is not

00:07:51,400 --> 00:08:00,070
fiction this is going to happen some in

00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:02,380
some distant future so maybe you think

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,990
this is a sad thing but I'm going to

00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:08,260
tell you that this is not necessary as a

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:11,280
bad thing because if not of these dying

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,840
stars you know we won't be here today

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,880
life on Earth will never happen at all

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,940
because the planet is the planetary

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,540
nebula and the explosion of stars is

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:30,160
very crucial to the generation of life

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:32,860
so Pete a tiny embryo or a diner a star

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,250
they both play in several inseparable

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:39,580
part in the burst of life so that's

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,620
because we're all star children so more

00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,130
than ninety percent of our bodies masks

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,390
were forged by some long gone star in

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,380
the distant past

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:55,450
some jacket jetstar that is so for

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:57,990
example if you are like 70 kilograms 63

00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:02,080
kilograms of your body mass is made from

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:07,240
alan's forge in some distant past inside

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,310
the core of a star a giant star so well

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,120
that's because you know in the beginning

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:17,040
the beginning is the big man that is

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:20,350
there's all the hydrogen and helium so

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:24,520
every heavier element like lithium or

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:27,010
carbon are formed in a later date during

00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,830
a process with code nucleosynthesis

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:33,550
which is basically in Creole fusions I

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:36,340
stars so elements that are substantial

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:39,940
to organic life-forms like carbon

00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,750
nitrogen oxygen there won't be here

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:48,190
today it is not because of this process

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:51,190
so now that you can see that well as

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:54,430
charming and chemistry and biology you

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:57,850
know they are not that different or

00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:01,780
should I say the both of them going to

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:05,590
some you know single greatest mystery of

00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:08,560
all time the origin of life so they will

00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:13,380
give answers to questions like how we

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:17,380
here and you know why we are here and

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:20,200
what a hack this is jae's calm damn it

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:23,880
this is not like philosophy Kong you

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:27,160
know so what are you talking about this

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,980
where's my refund damning I'm going out

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,100
I'm getting out no please please don't

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:36,850
do this okay or you know Thomas will be

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,130
mad at me yeah so what I would like to

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:42,250
really talk about is that why we are

00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:45,040
here today Theresa do is talk so I'm

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:48,690
hoping that we can agree these three

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,720
things which is convey ideas and

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:56,110
thinking process trying to you know

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,850
exchange ideas and see how ideas flow

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,190
and

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,509
to let you know that maybe we should

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:06,639
value cross disciplinary knowledge and

00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:11,440
how to draw inspirations from the nature

00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:14,079
the universe and we will use a classical

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:20,620
example which is a class composition as

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:23,199
an example for our general talk so first

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,259
just making sure that everyone is on the

00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:30,069
same page when we are using now we're

00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:35,649
talking about yes six classes very

00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:39,190
quickly so this is how yes this class

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:41,829
works I'm sure that most of you should

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,720
know this but just in case you haven't

00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:48,459
seen this before this is how it works

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:53,769
and it can be you know translated to es5

00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:56,860
in reality this road like this and as

00:11:53,769 --> 00:12:00,660
you can see this is a well-known pattern

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:04,060
or you know for classical JavaScript

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:07,480
development so it's not nothing special

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:11,040
here and there's also subclassing in

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,560
year six which is which goes like this

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:19,449
you can extend from a base class and you

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:23,560
can use super kohls so it can be

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:26,889
translated down to es5 like this it's a

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:31,839
little bit more complex but it's nothing

00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:34,480
really hot you know basically it's just

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,079
telling you that how actually you are

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,389
extending from the productive chain and

00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:45,519
how you are doing this super cold so

00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:48,730
that's a special here as well so maybe

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:52,649
more interesting is the another proposal

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:55,959
for es 7 which is a class property

00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:59,850
declarations I actually still in a very

00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:03,160
early stage I'd still in stage one but

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:08,050
you can use it today and it looks looks

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:10,290
like this previously you have to attach

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:14,579
some properties in the

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:16,769
but if you are using this news proposal

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:20,399
you can you know attach the property of

00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:23,190
class like this in Tucson I'm makes it

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:28,199
moral feels like a more integral part of

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:30,300
the class so and you can do you can do

00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:34,259
all this stuff if you are using better

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:36,839
already but just in case you don't know

00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:39,540
about this you can go to the Lebel

00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,420
website and you know grab grab the

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,870
excuse it's good to the ball and you

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:49,500
know try experimenting some of this new

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:55,319
syntax and there's also a ripple a trip

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:59,880
or you can get to play about so let's go

00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:03,269
through some quick back so first um yes

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,899
six classes are designed to be maximally

00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:09,269
mini mall so what it what does this mean

00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:14,519
maximal Ludmilla my so so strange you

00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:16,620
know well the actually it means that the

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:20,790
committee spend a lot of time trying to

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:23,069
make sure that they put the tiniest bit

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:27,319
of things into the new specification

00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:31,279
while enabling it to do a lot the

00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:35,459
maximum the possible things yeah so

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:38,750
that's why they only settle down some

00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:41,190
very basic features like extend and

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:47,160
super cold so there's nothing like

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:51,510
mixing centrist and so on so and just

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:54,680
make sure that you know this year six

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:58,920
classes is not actually a classical

00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:01,560
inheritance it still protocol and it's

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,589
just trying to formalize on a very

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,630
specific pattern of the protocol in

00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:09,060
Hilton's which is the constructor

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:13,519
pattern because everyone seems to be

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:16,290
using it so it's not actually trying to

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,010
actually trying to unburden the function

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:22,380
key word because before the es6 error

00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,699
function key words you know being used

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,639
in so married so

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:29,129
so many places like you know declaring a

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,160
method that construct turn a call back

00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:36,809
whatever and you are seeing this cure

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,819
everywhere so this is actually a good

00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:43,499
thing for static analysis and

00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:46,470
readability you know because it makes it

00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:49,109
more clear that what you are trying to

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:53,970
do with this block of code and conveys

00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:57,089
convey your intent more clearly so so in

00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,939
my humble opinion yes six classes appear

00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:04,589
at xle where the next level of language

00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:08,609
abstraction would appear and yeah it's

00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:12,299
just here for our usage but you know

00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:15,689
there are a lot of naysayers and during

00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:18,029
the formalization process and even now

00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:21,600
there are a lot of people who are

00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:24,929
opposed to this news feature but I'm my

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:28,169
take is this technology by itself has no

00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:33,480
good of evil and the same should apply

00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:36,629
to technique so what really matters is

00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,879
the intent the intent of doing same

00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:41,100
thing why are you doing this it's not

00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,369
actually the technology or the technique

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:48,319
itself so there are some you know some

00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:52,350
high-profile figures being very vocal a

00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:55,769
cup about you know the inclusion of

00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:58,679
classes in year six but i think the

00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:00,809
inclusion itself is neutral it's what

00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:07,500
you are trying to use it on that matters

00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:11,010
so one of the biggest reasons develop

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:14,039
housing you know classical inheritance

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:17,429
or inclusions itself is because of the

00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,139
fragile based class problem which means

00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:21,870
that you know something bad will happen

00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:25,350
if the injury emergence chain gets too

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:29,159
long like for example you can citizen in

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:32,820
a lot of places like for example in CSS

00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:34,890
basically CSS itself is a giant inherent

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,280
in style sheets

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:41,340
you know it's called cascading style

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:46,470
sheets after all so you know each style

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:49,950
applies to cascading down you know the

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:53,000
stout stellar chain and basically the

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:56,400
whole design of CSS was encouraged

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,920
encouraging the use of Global's so this

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,780
is a bad thing for developers and

00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,960
developers have been struggling with

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:08,670
this for so long and there's also the

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,400
extending sauce you know while extent is

00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:15,810
very powerful it can cause some troubles

00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:19,100
for if you are using in a round pattern

00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:21,480
or just using it in a round time yeah so

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,030
there are actually a lot of you know a

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,940
lot of online tutorials or tutorials

00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,520
trying to tell people when and when you

00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,140
should you and when shouldn't you use

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,450
extending sauce and you know this is

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,550
weird by itself because it's if

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,460
something is good and you shouldn't have

00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,940
to worry about this yeah you know you

00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,490
should be not very prone to error and

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:49,710
now the thing is the you know the scope

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:53,400
chain in angularjs I basically a very

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:57,960
long productive inheritance chain down

00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:00,630
each scope so I it's also been you know

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,720
very prone to error and a lot of people

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:06,810
have been complaining to this but i'm

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,390
not sure if there is any good solution

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:12,660
to this problem maybe he's a maybe

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,840
there's one it's you know i'm not sure

00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,480
this is in angularjs but overall you

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:23,070
should do conversation over in here jens

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,440
if if the situation allows cause long

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,890
and shaky convergence change is very bad

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,100
and it's very not very easy to handle

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:35,820
with so you know if you you pinned here

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,480
yesterday maybe you heard the one both

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:45,470
talked about CSS modules

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:46,850
so on the I CSS format yawn if you've

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,080
been here yesterday then you should know

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:54,770
about this new solution used state of

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:58,360
art in the front end development area I

00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:01,460
like you know we can use CSS modules to

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,640
marginalize the CSS we're using and

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,710
avoid the global scholarship problem and

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,610
maybe you should stop using cascading

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,860
after all at all don't use it and you

00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:15,410
know and it says modules also provides

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,290
some capabilities upper class

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:21,650
composition and itself can notify the

00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:24,799
problem of SAS extend and for angularjs

00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:29,179
maybe you should check out really rare

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:33,049
for you know for a healthy work maybe

00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:35,510
because react process is doing this in a

00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:39,320
very different fashion than the scope

00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:43,760
channel thing gorgeous so by design it

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:47,450
avoids the problem at all so just in

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,780
case you haven't check out react already

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,790
you can you know go figure it out on

00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:57,350
their website they have a very extensive

00:20:52,790 --> 00:21:00,980
documentation and here's a little bit

00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:04,520
about remixes and basically there was

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:10,940
there was a mixing implementation in

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:13,540
react prior to version 0.2 thing when

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:17,990
you're using the old react react class

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:21,410
method we can do that is but after a new

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,960
update several most before they you know

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:27,710
they strip is the way so if you are

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,840
trying to use es6 quiz riad there is

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,510
nothing you can do now you know to

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,990
include the mix-ins which is you know

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:38,990
it's kind of sad you know you know yeah

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,350
because pure in the mixing IP artisan

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:45,020
react you should know that this is very

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:47,750
essential part of react because it helps

00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,630
a lot to reduce the performance to

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,190
improve the

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:55,740
of the page so there was a debate over

00:21:53,190 --> 00:22:00,690
the internet about you know trying to

00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:03,990
bring mixings back to es6 react

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:06,570
components but my tech is that this is a

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:10,920
bad idea because mixing sentries have

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:14,280
their own problems now they're men their

00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:17,790
main problem is that there are two too

00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:20,970
weird or delhi uses because both mixing

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:24,630
centrate trying to address a problem

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:27,320
which is when the method overlaps they

00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:32,580
are trying to resolve the method either

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:35,850
either implicitly or explicitly like for

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:40,200
example mixings is doing this implicitly

00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:42,930
so for example like in ruby me by my

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,110
memory serves me correct in ruby it will

00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:50,670
try to resolve your mixing in a right

00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:54,180
first depth first order and in python

00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:58,110
there is a another very delicate

00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:00,090
operation code c 3 linearization that's

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:03,030
trying to you know do all this thing for

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,800
you but the problem is is to influence

00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:08,360
it and you don't know what happening the

00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,890
honest thing so there's another you know

00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,670
conversation method which is trades is

00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:18,600
trying to do this explicitly so you have

00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:20,820
to you know declare on each method what

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,000
you are trying to do with this method

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:26,760
when there is a you know conflict so

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,520
they are few a few options like you know

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:34,020
symmetric song which is addition and

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:36,540
removal or you know renaming but it is

00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:39,390
getting to you know excessive for your

00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,790
daily use if you're not going to want to

00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:44,460
do this for all your message if you are

00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:47,550
you know maintaining a large scale

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,770
project this is going to be a lot of

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:54,110
work and you know the chances you are

00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:56,230
using this is new nearly zero future so

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,720
maybe not

00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:01,540
using this approach so that's where I

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,350
start to explore some alternative

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:09,640
methods for composition which led me to

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:12,429
the following inspiration so I start

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,400
trying to look for you know some

00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:19,740
naturally occurring structures and it

00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:23,169
turns turns out that sells the vesicle

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:26,580
component for life is a very very good

00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:30,160
example for you know for this case and

00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:34,000
we're going to go through this very

00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,190
quickly I hope because this is not you

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,070
know maybe not very interesting to some

00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:42,390
of you but we have to learn some basics

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,340
about cells it is one of the most

00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:48,520
interesting and molecular structures of

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:54,580
our universe because you know there's

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:58,179
nothing like life and it has do with

00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:02,650
students of revolution to come to this

00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:05,290
current state and it's the so far the

00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:08,980
only known fundamental and universal

00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:13,990
building block of life so what's the

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:17,549
secret and maybe wishes from you should

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:22,200
do it from the very beginning of life

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:26,320
let's talk about how light begins so

00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:30,669
actually there is no definitive answers

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:34,890
here to this problem but the most common

00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:37,480
thing you know Syria right now is a

00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:40,990
biogenesis which means that you know

00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:44,669
life basically happens at a very deep

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:50,230
sea floor and there are a lot of like

00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:52,360
hydrodynamic bands you know screwing hot

00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:56,110
hot springs from the core of the earth

00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:59,740
and life forms there because it provides

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:01,250
heat and the necessary chemicals or you

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,610
know reaction is

00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:07,430
to begin kicking off some biochemistry

00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:10,990
process and he also provides some you

00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:15,950
know necessary environment to form the

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:18,470
the membrane of the cell so we have

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,390
mentioned that the formation of the

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,600
membrane of the cell is very important

00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:26,450
because without a compartment you can Co

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,500
it a cell so this is the first thing we

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:34,310
are going to look at I've been trying to

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:36,040
avoid this kind of diagrams but you know

00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:39,170
this is unfortunate we have to face it

00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,660
you know we have to face it some some of

00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,490
my children's talk I don't want this son

00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:48,140
like some some from the

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:51,800
textbook but yeah let's face it so this

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:56,330
is a protocell but actually it is not a

00:26:51,800 --> 00:27:02,150
sale it's just a ball being informed by

00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:04,720
a you know a nut so sick or later so all

00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:10,850
these all these small molecules here are

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:13,490
each are a 000 molecule and a very good

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:16,640
good way of thinking what it is is that

00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:19,160
you can think of it as a you know an

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,040
object and naturally occurring object

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,800
and is it an empty object is not

00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,500
something just an empty object so well

00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:32,060
some some people are not very acceptable

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:35,000
to the idea that life kind of cell

00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:37,960
originated but think about this it takes

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,900
the earth a billion years to build a

00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:45,920
empty object no did not that's not very

00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:48,380
small right so if you come to think

00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:52,760
about this it's not very you know very

00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:57,530
surprising so someone you know some more

00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:00,470
millions of years later and there are

00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:03,080
some more advanced not so advanced but

00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,630
more advanced than a protocell sales cup

00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,560
of code prokaryotic cell though which is

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:12,379
basically bacteria okay so as you can

00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:15,059
see in this diagram

00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:18,749
inside a prokaryotic cell there's

00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:20,249
basically no structure at all so a very

00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:23,849
good way of thinking about this is that

00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:25,769
you know think about pojo tango java

00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:28,229
squared an object we're playing with ja

00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:31,799
sweet ya just bring our JavaScript

00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:33,749
objects so how do we use a plain old

00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:36,259
java object you know there's basically

00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:38,909
no structure you just open a lot of

00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:40,979
properties and throw integers and

00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:43,529
screens and methods and bullying's and

00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:45,869
all kind of things inside and this is

00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:49,229
what you are seeing here you know there

00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:52,440
is no compartments you know DNA and RNA

00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:55,019
and all kind of stuff are you know

00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,769
mixing together inside the compartment

00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:01,529
so you know it's it's actually not a bad

00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:03,899
design I'm not sure I'm not here to

00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:07,919
judge but you know it gets things down

00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:11,879
so come to think about this a you know

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:16,399
the heaviest biomass on earth is formed

00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:22,079
by clock down which is pro Celtic and

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,940
productive life form but you know they

00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,039
can form something to advance because

00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:29,309
you know this kind of structures can

00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:31,889
only can only go so far but they are

00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:36,989
still nowadays very efficient you know

00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:42,349
they can get in town but yeah just go so

00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:45,299
far so after some more millions of years

00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:50,669
you know after some interesting process

00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:54,089
a more advanced more domest a variant of

00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:57,509
sales emerged which is called eukaryotic

00:29:54,089 --> 00:30:00,509
cell which is are what we are formed you

00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:03,419
know everyone here your body is won by a

00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:05,969
lot of product chaotic cells which is

00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:09,479
the you know so far the most advanced

00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:12,539
kind of self and the advanced cars they

00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:17,069
have a lot of you know components you

00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:20,479
know components encapsulation structure

00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:23,440
you know all these are good things so

00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:26,110
just look at it you know this is sang

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,590
good stuff you know it's like a real

00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:34,809
component instance with a lot of light

00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:37,330
metal hooks for your usage so another

00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:41,049
interesting thing to think about is that

00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:43,600
you know there's a not so small gap

00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:46,000
between a prokaryotic cell and the

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,029
eukaryotic cell you know there's so much

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,100
more structure so much more compartments

00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:55,389
actually they have a specific name code

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:58,120
a organelle okay now it's like literally

00:30:55,389 --> 00:31:01,450
a small organ so there are a lot of

00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,700
organelles here and how did how do they

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:06,309
come into its existence you know this is

00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:09,480
another unanswered questions in

00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:14,470
Canterbury contemporary science but

00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,929
there are some very convincing series

00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:19,779
right now that tries to address these

00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:24,159
problems want them one of which is

00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:28,139
called a sim biogenesis process which

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:31,419
basically means that you know our

00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:34,750
primitive cell ancestors try to it is

00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:37,539
eat some some other cells and they found

00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:41,110
out that you know instead of eating them

00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:44,649
fisting on them they can try to coexist

00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:48,549
with them so a whomped example is the

00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:52,210
psycho past which is what you will find

00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:56,980
in all the plant cells SATA place itself

00:31:52,210 --> 00:32:00,639
is believed you came from symbolic

00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:03,870
Genesis so their ancestor is very likely

00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:07,870
some you know some germ some

00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:12,100
cyanobacteria and you know in some

00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:16,269
ancient ancient has you know some cells

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:18,940
try to get this kind of small cells and

00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:22,509
after they eat them they found out that

00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:25,000
you know instead of shared them and you

00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:28,000
know feast on their substances it's much

00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,279
more better to your let them stay there

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,139
and you know that they do their stings

00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:33,020
because it's actually they are basically

00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:36,200
some

00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:39,230
you know sugar generating factory so you

00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:43,040
know free sugar why not so you know so

00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:45,770
they just stayed and co-evolved with you

00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,910
know some primitive cells and this also

00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:53,720
happens for another organelle another

00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:55,990
cell organ called mitochondria so you

00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,610
know the odor is actually first there's

00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:02,330
mitochondria cause coexisting with

00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:07,850
primitive cells then call a tow rope

00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:09,800
last so a lot of this process happened

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:13,640
in ancient times that we are not yet

00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:15,920
very sure that happened or not but we

00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,360
believe that is the one of the very

00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:24,710
possible hypothesis about the

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:27,230
origination of Advanced Cell so come now

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:29,720
that we have come to know about this how

00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:32,000
about that you know learn from the

00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,180
nature and try to implement this kind of

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:40,460
structuring our code so while inspired

00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:43,580
class composition so let's tweak our

00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:46,540
earlier implementation a little bit we

00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:50,450
are not going to declare a organized

00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:53,330
organism we are going to define a cell

00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:56,810
instead so here are a few you know

00:33:53,330 --> 00:34:00,590
properties for sale age the amount of

00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:02,870
glucose molecule and you know there are

00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,180
actually energy molecule but I'm not

00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,940
going to explain here they are just I'm

00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,490
going just to represent them in some

00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:14,630
drought in the integer and there is also

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:19,040
a very basic method code grow okay so

00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:22,070
very basic and you know grow basically

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,820
consumes energy and grow the cell and

00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:28,960
increases age and hear how we would like

00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:32,600
to define our mitochondria and

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,630
chloroplasts cause basically in essence

00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:39,860
they are still sells you know they still

00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:42,929
preserve a lot of trades trade about

00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:47,190
cells they hid their own DNA they have

00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:50,940
on our a synthetic process and you know

00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:54,559
a lot of similarities with a normal self

00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:57,869
so we're just you know extend them as a

00:34:54,559 --> 00:35:02,520
best class of using the cell as a best

00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:04,859
class and mitochondrial is actually like

00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,710
this you know power plant for ourselves

00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:10,410
so it creates energy you know it

00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:13,020
consumes glucose and turns them into

00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:16,109
some energy molecules know the ratio is

00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:19,220
not actually 12 wine but i'm not i'm

00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:22,170
trying to keep things simple here so

00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:25,740
there's also chloroplast chloroplast is

00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:29,760
not do those simple things that they use

00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:32,150
the energy from photon the light and you

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,770
know some or carbon dioxide and

00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:39,750
transform you know somehow generate

00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:42,990
glucose and oxygen now this can be a

00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:45,660
little bit daunting but you know just

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:48,390
I'm going I'm just going to let your

00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,400
skin test this really quickly but if you

00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:53,099
are interested we have a link to the

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,380
code later so basically I'm you know

00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:59,280
defying some more messes for a client

00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:02,099
cell you know it can basically the main

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,430
things that it can do something like you

00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:08,640
know divide an exiting micro country to

00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:11,510
make it into tube and there's also some

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,390
way to channel energy and glucose

00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:18,900
molecules we sing the cell and its

00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:23,760
Oconee organelle right between you know

00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:26,700
set up past and mitochondrial and this

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,609
is how we use it you know when you know

00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,730
just the same with new a plant cell then

00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:35,579
we can you know invoke the masses

00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:39,089
attached onto it and if you are

00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:42,990
interested here's the result and a link

00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:46,500
for you to play it links to a paper

00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:49,470
wrapper page which you can you know try

00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,690
to play around and see if you can find

00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:54,099
something more interesting now this is

00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,829
more like a proof of concept so

00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:59,200
you know if you are trying to do

00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:01,690
something you can add more abstractions

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,400
into it I'm not I didn't add too much

00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:05,999
abstractions because I'm just trying to

00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,579
get the point across but you know

00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:12,670
there's so much potential to this new

00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:15,160
way of class composition but actually

00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:17,349
I'm trying to tell this is I'm letting

00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,499
you know that I'm being honest here this

00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:22,809
is I seriously doubt that this is the

00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:26,890
first time someone using this technique

00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:30,309
because this is actually not a very hard

00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,569
technique right so for example if you

00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:33,759
are trying to explain this to a

00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:36,970
five-year-old you can just say something

00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:39,489
like oh I'm you know Instant agent in

00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:41,440
some you know some objects in the

00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:45,190
constructor method no that's basically

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,130
it but the point is what matters here is

00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:52,119
that why you are doing this the

00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,769
reasoning behind and you know the

00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,839
different thing in the different

00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:58,119
thinking process will use different

00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,539
results in your scepter way for example

00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:04,569
you know Flux Facebook flops you know

00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:08,079
every if you have check into the

00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:10,299
structure of flux structure in that you

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,599
will know that this is like basically a

00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:16,660
mediator pattern in disguise but there

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,390
are some subtle differences or you know

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:22,769
details in in the flux structure to make

00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:26,890
it shine through other similar

00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:29,489
implementations so what's more important

00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:32,759
is why you're doing this and the idea

00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:36,759
you're thinking process behind and

00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:39,969
perhaps now you you will come a little

00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:43,119
bit closer to my ideas that cross the

00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:46,150
circle mineralogy is somehow useful and

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,359
you can do not draw inspiration from the

00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:51,700
nature because you know it's like a

00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:53,769
giant simulation playground and the

00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:57,759
nature is doing older hard looking for

00:38:53,769 --> 00:39:00,270
you and coming out some of the best you

00:38:57,759 --> 00:39:05,550
know that's way of doing things

00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:08,730
so look around the nature and also it's

00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:11,340
not necessary not necessarily a bad

00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:13,920
thing to you know do the same thing that

00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:18,660
other people have done before because

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:22,740
for example the eye the eye the window

00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:26,850
of a soul has been you know evolved or

00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:29,430
like 50 to 100 times independently no

00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:31,950
it's not a single shot it's has do a lot

00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:35,100
of evolution and so long independently

00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:38,070
so you know there are actually a lot of

00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:40,800
kind of eyes existing on this earth

00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:43,770
there are some sea animals that can see

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:49,590
like you know a lot more colors than

00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:54,900
humans can can do so yeah it's not

00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:56,850
necessarily a bad thing so yeah so how

00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,250
about we you know pay some more

00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:01,260
attention to our environment and you

00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:04,620
know maybe there are some inspirations

00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:11,360
with him to be drawn okay now thanks for

00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:11,360
