	How I ended up automating my curtains and shouting at my laptop

We encounter automation every day and may not realise. It could be a set of traffic lights, a thermostat or automated tests for our code. It all works to make our lives easier and more efficient.

A couple of years ago I started working on a chat based automation system using JavaScript in my free time and in this talk I’ll share my progress, my reasons for doing it and what I’d like to do with it in the future. Hopefully I’ll inspire you to embrace automation in your daily life.
