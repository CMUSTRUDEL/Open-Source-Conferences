Title: Bodil Stokke: You Have Nothing To Lose But Your Chains | JSConf Budapest 2017
Publication date: 2017-12-01
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2017
Description: 
	This is a talk about the Open Source movement and the Free Software movement it grew out of, about its disregarded heroes and its flawed prophets, about what it’s doing for us and what it’s doing to us. I’d like to examine how it empowers us, and how it exploits us, and to show you why it’s really, really important that we figure out a way to make sure nobody can ever take it from us.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,359
yes so I'm actually not here to talk

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:10,500
about communism I just really like that

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:14,089
dog and what I'm actually here to talk

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,199
about oh we got a clicker

00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:18,199
you know keyboard cannot be identified

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:35,640
this is fine doesn't work why was I yes

00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:38,219
not communism actually um I'm here to

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,340
talk about something that has often been

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,920
compared to communism bye bye they so

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:48,110
don't like it

00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:50,700
which is in fact open source and just

00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:53,370
gonna dive right in I want to start off

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,600
by telling you a little story about this

00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:02,579
fellow called Richard Stallman in 1984

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:06,750
or there abouts Richard encountered the

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,390
printer so Richard was working at the

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,900
MIT artificial intelligence lab back in

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,430
the day and they'd just gotten a new

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,360
printer so this is something they used

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:24,060
to do the hardware manufacturers of the

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,890
time the mi ta AI lab among others had a

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,430
reputation for having enough some clever

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,950
people that so they would give them free

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,470
hardware and expect good feedback and

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,799
and software patches back and it was all

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:42,240
very nice so they just got a new printer

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,310
from from Xerox they they just made this

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,820
thing called a photocopier and they had

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,619
figured that in fact this photocopier

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,130
thing could be turned into a printer as

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:57,030
well instead of just receiving the image

00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:00,360
data from the that the photo part of the

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,700
photocopier they they could actually

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,149
just pipe data from a computer into the

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,860
printer part of the photocopier and this

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,039
was all very new and exciting back then

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,060
it was like even more exciting than

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,400
laser printers since I

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,870
fear the previous Britta they had was

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,569
the laser printer that had the

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,050
unfortunate habit of printing circles as

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:27,510
ovals and and diagonal lines a sort of

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:32,130
sine waves and that sort of thing but on

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:35,569
the other hand the Xerox engineers have

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,569
designed this thing to be basically

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,980
crude at all times there would always be

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,890
somebody at the photocopier making

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,530
photocopies so a design priority was not

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,590
to make sure that the thing doesn't Jam

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,950
it was more to make it easy for whoever

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,330
was at the machine to unjam it which is

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,920
great for a photocopier I'm not so great

00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:03,150
for a printer so the problem occurred

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,300
that they the printer would get jammed a

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:09,810
lot and somebody would have to go and

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:14,040
unjam it which happened to Richard one

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,569
day he had a very large print job he

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,329
went to the printer about an hour later

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:20,010
to check if it was done and he found

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,769
that not only was his print job not done

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,910
but the printer had jammed like 2/3

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,989
print jobs back so he was very upset

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,420
this is something he'd actually dealt

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,100
with previously as well how the old

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,110
printer tended to jam as well because

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,970
printers and what she done is so he was

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,859
not a technical engineer so he couldn't

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,230
make the printer Jam less but what it

00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:45,299
could do was patched the software so

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,700
that it would pull the printer see if it

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,590
was jammed and if it was it would email

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,079
everybody in the print queue saying the

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,380
printer is jammed you should go fix it

00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:57,150
on the theory that if you just email

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,769
though the person whose job has gotten

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,630
jammed they might not be responsible

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,060
enough to go fix it but it's more likely

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,940
if you email everybody that somebody's

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,829
gonna go sort it out for you so Richard

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,859
decided to implement this patch for the

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,620
new printer as well so he went to look

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:18,000
for the printer drivers of foix and he

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,370
couldn't find it he wasn't too worried

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,500
he knew that these things usually showed

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:27,510
up eventually didn't even really bother

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:30,390
pinging Xerox about it just just waited

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:34,950
patiently for the software to surface as

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:37,800
it usually did and months later he

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,110
decided even waited long enough it

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:46,770
didn't seem to be surfacing so he are

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:48,210
surrounded and discovered that the

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,840
fellow had actually written the printer

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:54,840
software had just left Xerox and taken

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,659
up a professorship at Carnegie Mellon to

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,590
which Richard frequently had occasion to

00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:03,300
to visit for work so he just waited

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,830
another month or so until he found

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,830
himself was coming to Carnegie Mellon

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:11,370
and went to see the fellow who wrote the

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,450
printer software and asked him basically

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,990
found him

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,640
Richard was was an engineering and nerd

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,370
so he was very terse it just went to the

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,140
fan a self ISM said hello I'm Richard

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,210
I'm from MIT

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,770
we got your printer and I had the

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,950
software because I'd like to patch it

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:32,070
and the fellow looks a bit uncomfortable

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,539
and said well I'd love to give you the

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:39,090
software but I've signed a nondisclosure

00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:40,979
agreement so I can't and Richard have no

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,330
idea how to even deal with this it was

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:47,240
an awkward social situation so being the

00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:51,690
person he was he just basically said

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,760
nothing got up and left and felt very

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:57,979
embarrassed and very furious about this

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,979
situation so

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,430
basically this is how the free-software

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,259
movement formed because Richards anger

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,440
at not getting that piece of printed

00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:19,490
driver sort of blossomed over the next

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,949
couple of years into the idea that he

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,830
needed to form a movement to make sure

00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:26,750
that software was always free and

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:32,120
available as it had been in in the

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:35,330
golden day some of I suppose US academic

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,610
hacker culture everybody shared software

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,010
freely among each other and and nobody

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:49,250
saw any reason to actually sort of horse

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:51,050
of barren and unguarded secrets so what

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,780
came out of that was the Free Software

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:57,590
Foundation and the GNU general public

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,599
license or the GPL for short which is a

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,620
free software license are basically

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:07,190
God's the principles that Richards

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:13,729
decided on to to safeguard the idea of

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:15,470
free software so basically the free

00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:19,039
software movement is about the idea that

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,210
software is the communal good and must

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,460
stay in the public domain where it can

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:27,010
be studied and modified freely that's

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,010
the heart of the free software idea

00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:34,909
right now we're in the late 80s and at

00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:36,409
this point not too many people have

00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:39,800
actually even heard of free software it

00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:44,030
wasn't the movement that was growing

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,039
very quickly then in the mid 90s that

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:49,550
are about this fellow called

00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:52,880
Eric Raymond published a treatise called

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,310
the cathedral and the bazaar which

00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,460
introduced arrival but very similar idea

00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:01,190
a compatible idea of sorts called open

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,949
source so this fellow Eric Raymond

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:11,180
published the text called the cathedral

00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:14,210
and the bazaar and the idea of this was

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:17,509
more pragmatic than the face of

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,819
commitment so

00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:21,889
the software still remains in the open

00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:25,249
under open source but the idea is not so

00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:30,460
much to preserve sort of the socialist

00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:33,649
idea of sharing in faith of flat but

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,260
it's more the practical notion that if

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:38,870
software is out there in the open then

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,909
other people can review code or the

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,699
people can contribute it to your code

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:47,240
and this is the way to make your code

00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:48,889
better quite simply it's a strictly

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,980
utilitarian philosophy

00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:55,070
unlike the frankly the socialism of free

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:58,940
software but still argue arguably has

00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,810
the greater good in mind so the

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,639
flagships

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:05,480
of the open source movement at the time

00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:09,529
were Linux the operating system or the

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:15,680
kernel which was using the GPL license

00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:17,540
but definitely sort of politically was

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:23,449
more aligned with open source and free

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:26,750
software and there was this thing called

00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:30,680
Netscape which started off from the

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:35,449
other direction as a piece of

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:39,560
proprietary software which the company

00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:42,040
Netscape decided to to put to make

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,199
available under an open-source license

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,970
and this turned into the Mozilla browser

00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:51,740
that we know today and the Mozilla

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:57,170
Foundation so the open source movement

00:09:51,740 --> 00:10:01,430
which which grew out of the 90s and the

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:03,860
the 2000 tended to not be too keen on

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:07,519
the GPL depending rather on what they

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:11,329
called permissive licenses like BSD and

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:16,850
and MIT these did not include the the

00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:18,829
GPS Sharon eye closes but was more about

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,959
pragmatically allowing software to you

00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:22,279
to corporate open source software

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,050
without needing to share back

00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:28,430
necessarily but preserving the the

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,529
rights you were granted under the

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:35,389
license for this the open source of with

00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:37,519
typically so this was more in tune with

00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:40,189
the idea with a pragmatic idea if it's

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,589
all stats everybody can use this

00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:44,689
software for whatever they like even to

00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:46,540
bid for pricier stuff laughs but the

00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:50,680
software itself has to stay available

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:53,990
and getting to this decade it sort of

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,430
changed a bit and so you have the

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,610
idealism of free software and you have

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,230
the pragmatism of open source and it's

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,629
sort of turning into something onto

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:06,470
getting you again it's something a bit

00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:08,509
like us maybe programming as self

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,220
expression where the artist isn't

00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:13,399
concerned with community improvement or

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,589
collective collective bug-fixing so much

00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:19,459
is putting their work out there to be

00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:22,550
appreciated for its own sake we're still

00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:24,740
I think myself as a community trying to

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,949
figure out the shape of this new

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,870
community but it's really exciting to me

00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:31,910
because in many ways this has been my

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:38,569
own motivation for writing software from

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:40,759
from the very start today but now I feel

00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:43,040
like like people are actually writing

00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,350
software just for the fun of it or for

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,980
the lyosha of it and I think that's

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:51,800
really wonderful but in summary whether

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,829
you see open-source as socialism or

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,529
pragmatism or or even art what it all

00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:59,600
points down to ultimately and this is

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,509
what makes it so extremely important as

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:09,110
an idea is that open-source gives us

00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:11,170
agency and what I mean by that is that

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,959
open-source actually grants us the power

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:18,110
first of all as Richard demanded to

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,600
create so we have the the source code

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,879
for the software we use available to us

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,769
so that we can easily customize it

00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:29,689
improve it and repair it as we see fit

00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:32,179
which empowers us as users as well as

00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:33,620
programmers and it enhances the larger

00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:37,249
community of the users and programmers

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,589
and this is perhaps the most important

00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:42,730
of all it also gives us the power to

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:45,610
learn how software is built

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:49,330
we have the vast bulk of open-source

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:52,030
software available to us and we have the

00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,970
ability to examine it to learn how it

00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:59,290
works and how to build similar systems

00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:01,660
of our own and and anyone can do this I

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,550
mean given the admittedly not

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,100
unrestricted resource of time at least

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,020
there are no gatekeepers to the

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,990
knowledge it's readily accessible to

00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,850
anybody without eating to pay anything

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,860
without needing to get accepted into a

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,530
university or anything like that

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:21,420
it's all right out there in the open and

00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:24,310
that is actually really powerful but

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:28,000
what's so crucially important about the

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:34,960
idea of open source so to clarify this

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,920
well we're missing a slide I know there

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,240
was an exercise right okay to clarify

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:45,400
let me tell you the story of the man who

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:51,880
wanted to go to Mars let's call him

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:54,580
Elon after the the fiction of Martian

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,490
leader from a science fiction story by

00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,400
some rocket scientist I forget

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:03,940
coincidentally of course

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:07,090
so his ambition is no less than to

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:11,560
actually send humans to Mars and put a

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:13,810
human colony on the planet Mars now

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,290
interestingly at least for the short

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:19,120
term his company SpaceX is actually

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:23,760
developing the technology they need to

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:27,460
facilitate going to Mars out in the open

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:31,570
citing the fact that their only real

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:34,990
competitors are Public Interest agencies

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:37,150
like NASA which actually don't don't

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,320
keep their work a secret at all so it's

00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,610
all happening in the open they're all

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,210
sharing then take the technological

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:45,449
advances openly including this this

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,129
commercial operations place

00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:51,310
my mic is falling off just a second

00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:52,839
there we go so in a very real sense you

00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,060
could say that space access is an open

00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,490
source company in a larger open source

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:01,029
community just that they're not actually

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:05,110
doing software so much as space as it

00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:09,040
were now imagine if this were not the

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,540
case imagine perhaps if someone with

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,279
different ideas about intellectual

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,769
property or in charge of the company

00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:18,579
this of course this this picture is

00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:21,100
randomly chosen imagine if the knowledge

00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:24,309
needed to send our species to another

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,550
planet was locked away inside some

00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:29,620
company some company's intellectual

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,819
property vaults as it were imagine if

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,709
some company was the gatekeeper to

00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:36,430
humanity's ability to actually go in and

00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:39,220
colonize the universe and putting back a

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,050
bit from the granulation of space travel

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,249
imagine if companies controlled the

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,680
knowledge of how to write different

00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:45,490
kinds of software inside their corporate

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,550
silos

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,980
imagine if the only way to learn how to

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:54,490
be a serious programmer was to sign up

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,629
with some giant corporation and you were

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,149
only allowed to use the knowledge you

00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:01,750
gained from it as as directed by the

00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:05,110
corporation or you will get shut down by

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:07,389
by patent lawsuits or similar this is

00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:11,430
sort of thing that keeps me up at night

00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:14,740
honestly so the point I'm trying to make

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:17,589
it's that it's not ultimately about the

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:20,290
software that we write it's about the

00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:23,199
knowledge we put out that of how to

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:26,980
build the software that we write the

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:30,160
programs we leave behind they're not

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,170
really our legacy as programmers what

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,329
we're really contributing is the

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,980
knowledge that we develop the knowledge

00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:39,550
that we discover and the knowledge that

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:42,100
we pass on so to me it's actually really

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:44,999
important that we think very seriously

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:49,569
about how we protect that knowledge

00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:51,100
which which belongs to all of us from

00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:54,519
being locked away behind walls of

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,490
intellectual property and whatnot so I'm

00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:59,199
sorry I'm going to get

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:04,809
I'm goes again into the legal details

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:10,689
now the GPL I mentioned what happens to

00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:14,319
be one mechanism for this and I've got

00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:17,679
actually a cheat sheet for you now if

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,319
you believe in this idea of preserving

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,459
the knowledge at all costs you want to

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,439
use the license that actually and source

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:30,160
that this happens

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:32,290
so the GPL says that not only must your

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,790
code remain freely available it also

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,760
cannot be linked with proprietary

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:40,150
software so the idea there is to

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,270
encourage everything to exist in a fully

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:46,330
open ecosystem now if you have the term

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,580
viral applied to the GPL that was sort

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,160
of Microsoft's way of referring to to

00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:55,600
this idea in this negative way as they

00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:58,270
could think of and the GPL is actually

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,549
really strict about this but in the

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:04,330
interest of sort of the socialist idea

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:06,190
of sharing knowledge this is a less

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,580
demanding version of the GPL called the

00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:14,110
the lesser GPL as GPR and there's also

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:16,090
the Mozilla Public License which kind of

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:18,760
makes us the same requirements as the GP

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,809
out but it's still it's constrained just

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,429
to your particular project or even

00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,080
particular files inside of that project

00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:27,460
so you think the GPR kind of goes a

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,290
little bit too far you might want to

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,080
have a look at the Mozilla license which

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:35,040
is also quite decent and finally if

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,870
you're not actually making software but

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,419
things like writing or visual arts or

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:43,600
music then you can consider the creative

00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:45,490
commons share-alike license share alike

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,169
is particularly close and the Creative

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,440
Commons license which tests SATs and

00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:53,830
you're free to copy and modify this as

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,710
you please but you have to if you do so

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:59,140
you have to publish your derivative work

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:03,669
under the same license making it too

00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,860
freely available now this is all from

00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:07,840
the perspective of somebody who really

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,100
want to make sure that that free stuff

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,340
what happens you might not be

00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:17,110
person I am but it's still a reasonable

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:19,250
phone and actually a lot more common for

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,720
people to just want to make sure that

00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,330
their work is free and available to

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,200
everybody and they that everybody can

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:30,860
use it as they like this is basically

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:34,190
open source and in this case I'd like to

00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,960
make a plea to you because I think the

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,419
most popular license for this by far is

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,320
the MIT license and BSD is also quite up

00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:44,000
there but can I ask you please if this

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,140
is how you feel about so if I consider

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,230
the apache license because MIT is is is

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,960
home quite fine as a license it's very

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,440
short which a lot of people like but a

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,850
lot of the protections that offers are

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,669
implied by the wording of the MIT

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,730
license being as short as the days like

00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:07,010
for instance patient protections the MIT

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,059
license says something like everybody's

00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,250
free to use the software without

00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:13,130
restriction which implies there has to

00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,200
be a patient grant if the author of the

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,500
software owns the patent for the

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,990
software as well now the apache license

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,150
actually has things like this the patent

00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:25,059
crowns in in plain text inside the

00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:28,190
license so it's an explicit grant

00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:30,140
whereas MIT tends to usually hold up in

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,610
court for this sort of thing it is

00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,929
actually a lot better to have this

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:37,250
language specifically in the license so

00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:40,220
if you're on the permissive side of

00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,840
open-source I would like to urge you to

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,320
please consider the apache license for

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,299
your next project rather than MIT or of

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,590
course the GPL or the mozilla license if

00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:55,400
you like so just at the end this is

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:57,830
where it gets social this is the awkward

00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,539
posthumous talk because it would be

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,789
almost dishonest of me not to address

00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:03,110
what might well be considered the

00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:06,409
elephant in the room at this point

00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:08,750
because you only that our community

00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:12,220
leaders sometimes turn out to be a bit

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:15,409
rubbish and Richard as it happens

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,860
Richard Stallman it's not necessary an

00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:21,169
exception to this I don't think he's

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,240
actually malicious in any real sense but

00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:26,230
the truth is is

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,350
it says some pretty awful things I don't

00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:32,110
think he means to hurt people but it's

00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:35,610
more a matter of not knowing quite how

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,610
to behave properly in civilized society

00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:44,050
and I mean I don't mean to excuse him

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:46,320
actually it is a bit problematic for the

00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:49,290
leader of the free software movement to

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:54,820
to behave in this way and maybe it's

00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:57,160
time for him to step down and when it

00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,990
comes to Eric Raymond I'm not even going

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,720
to go that he's literally the worst

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:04,660
person in existence I just feel it's

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,520
important to mention that and my purpose

00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,200
in going to this rather dark place at

00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,960
the end of the talk is to stress that

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,120
even though the idea of open-source been

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,420
always have sort of sprung from the most

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,990
saintly of people it's not about the

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,220
people in the and we shouldn't be

00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,380
treating these people as heroes which

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,890
not really treating anybody as heroes

00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:29,920
and what matters is the idea of open

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,480
source or whichever direction you

00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,920
approach it from whether it is from the

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,960
left or from the right or permissive

00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:42,250
restrictive care or don't care

00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:46,300
all of that it's not about the people

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:48,340
it's about the idea and the idea what it

00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,000
comes down to in the end is the

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,900
knowledge embedded in the community

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,910
that's what's so important to protect

00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,720
the knowledge of how to write software

00:22:54,910 --> 00:23:02,790
and more broadly the knowledge of how to

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:08,080
do anything we as humans are able to do

00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:11,500
even one day you and me we're going to

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,350
go to the stars and the knowledge to do

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,080
that we must preserve that at all costs

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:20,440
and that is what open source is really

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:24,390
all about thank you so much for enduring

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,450
this enjoy the book

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,450
