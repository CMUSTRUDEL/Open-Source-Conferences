Title: Don Burks: MVC - What a web app and a Mozart Violin Concerto have in common | JSConf Budapest 2017
Publication date: 2017-12-01
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2017
Description: 
	If I told you that a Mozart Violin Concerto and an MVC web app shared architectural similarities, you would probably scoff. You’d start laughing if I said that Mozart and the developer who built the web app had nearly identical approaches. However, in this talk which compares actual code and musical examples, you’ll see how music and coding share a number of characteristics beyond just obscure syntax and a learning curve. And hopefully, you’ll find some interesting reasons to change your approach to architecting web applications.

good morning J is calm food a past being

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,240
the first Speaker of the day I have to

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,550
you know be the one for today that

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,110
points out once again how lucky we are

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,599
to be standing in this you know sitting

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,850
in this venue getting to listen to the

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,590
brilliant minds of our day sharing

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,710
things and they will be coming up later

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,070
but until then I'm going to talk for a

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,050
few minutes the title of my talk as it

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,900
says is NBC Mozart Violin Concerto

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,489
versus model-view-controller and you may

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,700
be like okay old guy on stage

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,899
model-view-controller that makes sense

00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,480
the truth is I'm not going to mention

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,399
model-view-controller probably even once

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,120
it just makes a really good pun with

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,600
Mozart Violin Concerto this is me I'm

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,190
from Vancouver and in Canada though I

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,420
was originally born in the States please

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,840
don't hold that against me I've been in

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,399
Canada for 20 years my current role is

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,170
I'm head instructor of lighthouse labs

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,180
which is a software development bootcamp

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,300
that means my job is to teach people

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,309
everyday about coding I have been a web

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,070
developer for 19 years

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,830
I remember when we still had like the

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,330
macro media preload images rollover in

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,119
JavaScript like that was advanced

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:19,830
JavaScript for a web page I remember

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:22,350
those days but this is also me I started

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,970
off with a degree in music from Columbus

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,090
State University in Columbus Georgia

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,369
and my original goal in life was that I

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,470
was going to perform in opera orchestras

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,869
and ballet orchestras and musicals all

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,000
around the world and live that kind of

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:40,320
Jet Set tuxedo life and that was going

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,290
to be my world but interestingly in 1998

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,759
I got introduced to the world of web

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,159
development computers had always been a

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,060
hobby of mine I'd always loved using

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,610
computers and I found this this web

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,030
thing that people were talking about and

00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,060
using HTML and using what barely passed

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,770
for CSS at that point and I had a couple

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,020
really good mentors who introduced me to

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,090
what best practices were and how to get

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,030
involved and I found that the web was a

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,009
perfect canvas if I could imagine it it

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,020
could go on the screen and that

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:15,450
motivated me that move

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,910
and my hobby and my career swapped

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,520
places in the span of literally about

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,620
four days during which time I built

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,690
probably the worst webpage ever it was

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,240
purple it had fish at the top there was

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,000
a big forum where every input field was

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,340
about this wide on an 800 by 600 screen

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,860
of course but I'm still an active

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,450
musician I performed principal horn with

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,100
the Vancouver Pops Orchestra and a few

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,400
other organizations in Vancouver and

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,020
it's very much a part of my life and

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,740
with something being that much a part of

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,370
your life

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,160
you end up analyzing the ways in which

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,830
you can get better in all the parts of

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,610
your life and I started to notice as I

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,520
progressed some crossovers between music

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,470
and technology and they weren't just you

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,210
know the common ones like I listen to

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:08,520
music while I'm coding that that's an

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:10,320
obvious one as I this I realized that

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,030
what I was searching for more than

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,970
anything else is I was searching for a

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:19,020
way for my music to make my technology

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,600
better and the creative side of me the

00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,640
analytical side of me started having a

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,870
conversation and if you've ever had that

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,260
many voices in your head well you

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,150
probably need medication but I found

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,730
some some interesting parallels there

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,170
and so I figured this was something I

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,140
could get up onstage and I could talk

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:40,650
about because approach for us as

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,570
developers is everything but it is a

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,820
tech presentation so I have to have an

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,700
obligatory Jeff so I wanted to get that

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,010
one out of the way early and I want to

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:57,170
start off this morning with a little bit

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:57,170
of culture if the sound would play

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,480
that gives gives you a preview of what's

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,480
coming up

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,200
Noyce I promise this worked about half

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,200
an hour ago

00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,260
yeah

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:04,759
which is weird because it was virtual

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:04,759
for perfect

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:29,159
and now for some culture that was the

00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,919
entrance for the violin soloist to the

00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:33,479
Mozart Violin Concerto number one that's

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,569
15 seconds of your life that you won't

00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,750
get back but it's 15 seconds of your

00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,849
life that you listen to something that

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,409
you probably weren't paying attention to

00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:47,189
the fact that there was a tremendous

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:48,659
amount of structure and technique and

00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:50,039
things going on behind it you're just

00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:54,779
like oh hey Mozart first thing in the

00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:59,310
morning not bad but I want to take that

00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:00,509
that clip and I want you to now listen

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,590
to it again in your head I'm not gonna

00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,029
play it again but listen to it in your

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,699
head again and think about the fact that

00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:08,819
there is a very solid structure there

00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,400
there's a very definite set of technique

00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,110
that is being demonstrated there and the

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,110
reason I point these things out is

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,120
because when we go to use a web

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,620
application as consumers because we're

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,879
all consumers of the web as well as

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,550
builders of the web but when we go to

00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,400
use a web application we don't think

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,349
about the structure that's going on when

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,969
you sit down and you use Instagram or

00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,379
Facebook you're not thinking about the

00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:33,419
load balancers you're not thinking about

00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,009
the caching or the Reedus sessions or

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,500
whatever may happen to be going on

00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:42,089
behind the scenes you're just using an

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,680
app and that's fine and we we think we

00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:46,229
might peel the curtain back and think

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,889
about what's going on underneath but

00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:52,800
music has that same structure and so

00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:55,680
this usually brings up the question of

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,529
who cares great music has structure gone

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,069
we knew that but if I'm going to talk

00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:04,259
about these parallels then I actually

00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:07,319
have to start pointing out some very

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:10,020
specific areas where we should care we

00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,629
as developers should care and the reason

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,569
is we as musicians and developers get to

00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:17,370
think similarly quick show of hands how

00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:18,169
many of you have spent at least one year

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,090
of your life

00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:22,520
either taking using music lessons

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:25,900
playing in a musical group singing a

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:29,020
chorus something like that fair number

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:32,599
that's going to help me quite a bit

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,639
users care the reason users care is

00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:38,840
because software and music are both a

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:42,439
craft if you go to the symphony and you

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,779
are listening to lang lang or Yo Yo Ma

00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:48,469
or Itzhak Perlman or any of the the

00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:51,259
great great performers of our day you

00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:54,229
are seeing an absolute virtuoso a craft

00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:57,169
you know a crafts person at work very

00:07:54,229 --> 00:08:00,469
similarly you know when we go and we use

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:02,689
a lot of the you know powerful and

00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:05,599
well-built apps that we use every day we

00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:08,479
are seeing a craft at work when we see

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,610
someone up here live coding and we see

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,259
the the techniques that they are

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,159
demonstrating we're watching a

00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:16,580
craftsperson

00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:19,460
at work that's impressive and I would

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,159
much rather eat at a Michelin star

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,949
restaurant where the chef is a

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,520
consummate master of their craft than at

00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:28,490
Burger King

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,610
for example the craftsmanship of our

00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,979
work matters and I say that you should

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,250
care because I said earlier approaches

00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,990
everything if we can get better at

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,149
approaching our craft we will make

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,110
better products and I'm going to stand

00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:43,969
up here I'm going to say something

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,320
slightly controversial but I won't break

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:48,680
the code of conduct not that kind of

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,500
controversial and it's that for all the

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,990
work that we do we don't get hired to

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:57,949
code there's not a single person in this

00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,079
room that is employed to code we get

00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:04,370
hired to build products that's what we

00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:05,740
do we support the benefit that data is

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,140
going to give to a user

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:11,000
we provide features that give those

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,380
users benefit and ultimately our

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,819
products generate revenue for our

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,940
company's revenue turns into our

00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:18,889
paychecks and let's face it while we

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,260
care about our craft and we care about

00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:24,860
the creativity we also care about

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,750
getting paid so you should care approach

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,329
makes better preventer approach makes

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,980
better products and I should care

00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:33,589
because I decided to be brave and talk

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,910
about this so I have to care about

00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,380
let's talk a little bit about Mozart

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:40,640
this is your history lesson for the

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,920
morning Mozart was born in 715 1756

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,690
lived until 1791 for those of you that

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,020
are doing the math that means he died at

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:50,180
about 35 36 years of age so he had a

00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,860
very short life most of the things that

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,390
you've heard about him are true don't

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,980
pay attention in the movie Amadeus it's

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:59,630
completely farcical but he was

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,910
absolutely a virtuoso of his time he was

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,950
a child prodigy he was composing his

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,140
first opera at the age of five he was

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,660
performing in public at the age of four

00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,700
like huge salon performances where

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,850
hundreds of people would come to listen

00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:17,600
to him play he was absolutely the rock

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:21,560
star of his time and interestingly in

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,600
his very short life I he composed a

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,300
tremendous body of work by the time he

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,930
died he had over 600 completed works

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:32,750
that is prolific in a way that we can't

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,310
fathom really as developers if I was to

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,690
ask for a show of hands I doubt any of

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,750
you would be able to raise your hand and

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,700
say that you have 600 completed products

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:44,089
that you have built in your lifetime and

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,410
these are 600 products that are out in

00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:47,810
the marketplace that people are

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,839
consuming and using and other people are

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:54,190
are being inspired by and this is just a

00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,510
short list of what he was able to

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,329
contribute in his lifetime I mean 22

00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,740
operas those are huge and he wrote 22 of

00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:04,370
them and had two more that were

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,829
unfinished on top of that I'm 44 I got

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,140
pants on this morning like that's my

00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:14,140
accomplishment and trust me I'm happy

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,140
about that like thank you right

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,600
so what I wanted to find was taking the

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,730
example of someone like Mozart who's

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,190
famous for being very prolific and

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,709
having tons and tons of works that he

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:32,040
was able to complete I wanted to figure

00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:34,709
out how I could hack my productivity if

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,779
I could use someone like Mozart or Bach

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:39,510
or Beethoven or any of the great masters

00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:42,269
of music and look at how they built

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:45,480
their products look at how they

00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:47,100
approached their craft and see if there

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,260
was something that I could learn from it

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,870
in order to make me a better developer I

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,029
mean I you know I build JavaScript all

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,600
the time I know several languages I've

00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:59,370
been around the block not my first rodeo

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,260
but I wanted to get better I always want

00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,540
to get better and so I started to look

00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,089
at what approach they were using

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,949
specifically Mozart being so prolific

00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:11,070
what approach they were using that I

00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:13,550
could be inspired by and I had to ask

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:18,329
myself what does it have to do with code

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:20,850
and initially it wasn't there wasn't a

00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:22,860
lot that was forthcoming because while a

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,839
lot of has been written about Mozart's

00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,970
life nobody really sat down and

00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,560
interviewed him Barbara Walters style to

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,990
you know figure out what made him tick

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,779
back in you know 1780 or something like

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,940
that you know we didn't have TMZ you

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,260
know following around with pictures so

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,389
it was a little bit harder to figure out

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,550
so I had to do just a bit of analysis

00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:43,350
based on what I knew and what I could

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,110
find and there were a couple things that

00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,970
came out that allowed me to take lessons

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:52,579
of Mozart's life and apply them to code

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:54,720
and the first the biggest was structure

00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:56,490
one of the things that mozart is

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,220
absolutely famous for is the structure

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:02,010
of his music he pretty much defined the

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,959
Classical period of music much to the

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:08,310
chagrin of many other composers of that

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:11,220
age Mozart was seen as the paradigm very

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,880
much you know we might look at say Dan

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,160
Abramov's

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,449
egg head tutorials as the the paradigm

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,279
of how to learn Redux

00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:18,870
although I know all of you have that

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,459
perfect blog post that explains it way

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,370
better than he does it's not like you

00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:26,850
wrote it or anything but structure was

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:30,539
important to to Mozart

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,609
and our apps have structure you know I

00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:34,739
can put up this diagram and we can all

00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:36,539
trace through it and see you know

00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:38,249
there's a service okay we've got cloud

00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:41,579
storage we've got external thing for

00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:43,769
sessions we understand the workflow here

00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:46,889
but we're very careful about building

00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:48,959
structures like this whether it is just

00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:51,239
a simple web app you know even though

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:55,470
like a one-page or and express whether

00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:57,929
it is a complex bordering uncomplicated

00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,699
you know distributed micro service

00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:01,949
architecture and everything that would

00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:03,959
go into that our apps have a very

00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:06,449
definite structure in fact the

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:08,069
structures that we use we tend to call

00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:10,350
them design patterns and that can go

00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:11,459
from everything like the async if he's

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,609
that Jonathan was talking about

00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:18,359
yesterday turn Ares all the way up to

00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:21,359
entire app structure like this well

00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:23,369
musicians composers particularly have a

00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:25,350
structure to their music the one that

00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:26,729
Mozart was famous for perfecting was

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,339
what's called the Sonata Allegro form

00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:31,229
and I promise that you looking at this

00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:34,559
is the same effect that musicians have

00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:38,039
when they look at this but this is a

00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:40,379
very particular form that most of the

00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,959
music that Mozart wrote follows in fact

00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,639
the piece that we listened to earlier if

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,799
we were to listen to the whole thing and

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,809
this was a music theory class and I had

00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,970
four hours of your life that I could put

00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:54,089
into analyzing it we would be able to

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,850
break down very easily onto this diagram

00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:59,249
that piece of music once you've heard it

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,919
a couple times you almost can't unhear

00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:04,619
it the exposition the development the

00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:08,519
regular recapitulation they're very

00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:10,169
obvious as structure of the music we

00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,829
envision our applications as whole

00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:15,600
systems a lot of times we're responsible

00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,309
for one small piece of it a lot of times

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,539
we're responsible for architecting the

00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:24,179
entire broad hole but we see them as as

00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:27,839
whole systems but they have structures

00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:30,419
inside of them this is the structure of

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,189
a few I'm going to go back 75 years

00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:35,909
further in musical history to Johann

00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:37,169
Sebastian Bach 1685 to 1750 not that you

00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:40,130
care

00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:42,410
Bach was famous for the few

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,940
which is four completely independent

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,180
lines anywhere from two to five actually

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,190
but four completely independent lines of

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,829
music four different melodies being

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:55,190
played together at the same time to form

00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:58,069
a whole new piece of music sounds a lot

00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:00,290
like concurrency asynchronous operations

00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:02,480
parallel processing a lot of the things

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:06,470
that we would have in our applications

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,899
on a daily basis second big piece was

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,850
approach structure matters okay I know I

00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,980
need to focus on the structure but then

00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:16,130
I need to think about the approach how

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:19,370
am I going to think about my application

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:24,769
my product my composition before I write

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:27,410
it and I realized that I had to look at

00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,850
it the same way structurally that a

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,329
musician would look at a piece of music

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:34,399
and musicians especially since a lot of

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:35,750
you have experience we have two ways of

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,399
thinking we have the horizontal or

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,160
melody and we have the vertical which is

00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:43,399
our harmony so horizontally how can I

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,319
think about things and one of the the

00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:49,130
quotes that's great comes from Edward de

00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:50,029
Bono and 1967 so it's even older than I

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,160
am

00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:56,029
but he talks about how lateral thinking

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,760
is stepping to one side laterally and

00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:01,190
thinking about something in an

00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,110
unconventional way taking steps to solve

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,150
a problem that you may not have

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,010
otherwise thought were the

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,829
straightforward way to solve a problem

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,600
we've all had that moment typically we

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:13,579
call it you know being clever or mad

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,709
hacks or one of those terms that

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,929
justifies us doing something that might

00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:20,030
be a little bit unconventional Mozart

00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:23,000
did this all the time melodically in

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:25,280
Mozart's works he did things that were

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,370
considered unconventional for the time

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,950
but now are considered absolutely 100%

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:33,140
standard if he's when they first came

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,630
out you know when we first started

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,280
seeing this this pattern emerge it was

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,440
considered unconventional in a wild and

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,549
you know cowboy coding and yes I just

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,440
did finger guns but they were you know

00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:48,230
that was an example of lateral thinking

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,049
being applied to the craft of building a

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,820
piece of music this is actually the the

00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,810
written out music for what you just

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,130
listened to a few minutes

00:17:53,810 --> 00:18:00,440
ago and there is a very definite

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,680
horizontal flow the melody of a piece of

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:07,460
music is the horizontal flow of that

00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,680
music when we're thinking about that

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,630
progressing over time you know this

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,380
becomes a timeline as much as it does

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:18,290
just a direction that the music is going

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:21,590
this is music borrowed from the theme of

00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:24,020
a very popular TV show which involves

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,400
dragons and a lot of naked people whose

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,230
name I won't say for copyright reasons

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,400
but it rhymes with rain of Bones and

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,590
there's a couple things that are really

00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,640
interesting in this piece of music and

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,290
for those of you that can read music

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,620
notation you're probably humming it in

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:41,900
your head but I've taken the liberty of

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:45,020
applying a couple of carefully placed

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,660
green arrows to show that even the

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,880
structure of this music is designed to

00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,820
move it forward the melody is actually

00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,480
designed to have you feeling that

00:18:52,820 --> 00:19:00,020
anticipation it's almost like when we

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,760
build I don't know a tour on an app that

00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,950
we've just built and we're trying to

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,380
draw that user in or when we monetize a

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,550
landing page and have calls to action

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,730
that they're going to draw the user

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:13,250
forward there is a pattern here of

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,730
thinking horizontally through time and

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:19,520
what is going to move our listener to a

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,500
piece of music or our user in web

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,420
application what is going to move them

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:29,180
forward in time algorithms a very wise

00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,550
humble man who I I won't name though I

00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:35,630
will say that he is bald and charming

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:37,280
and incredibly handsome came up with

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,110
this quote in the middle of the night

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,110
one night but algorithms are the

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:45,920
melodies of an application and this was

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:49,490
my aha moment this was my aha moment

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,260
where I could say this is how this is

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,140
that crux where the parallels really

00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:57,140
start to click together these steps that

00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,780
we take to process the data that we are

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,760
giving our users access to those are the

00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,220
steps that move forward in time like the

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,020
individual notes that I would put into a

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,670
melody to have it move forward in time

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,970
our algorithms are the melodies of our

00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:14,580
app when we're thinking horizontally as

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,440
a developer you know we'll take Robin as

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,700
a user Robin's gonna click a link that's

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,180
going to send to get requests from the

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,460
client clients going to hit the server

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,620
servers going to make an API call maybe

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,320
to some popular service that serves up

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,600
JSON data very nicely that API is going

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,810
to return some data we might take that

00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,390
and send it into something like Watson

00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:38,220
in order to analyze it and the server is

00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,510
going to get data back from Watson build

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,990
a response and it's going to send it

00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:45,500
back to Robin this is a horizontal

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:49,200
progression of steps that we can follow

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:52,290
very similar to how we might follow the

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,450
melody of a piece of music fizzbuzz is

00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,760
another great example we all know how

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,200
fizzbuzz works and if you don't well

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,540
it's the worst Tech interview question

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,160
ever you just need to memorize ten ways

00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,420
to do it that are all in one line in

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,800
different languages and then just ready

00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,220
regurgitate it when you go for an

00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,920
interview but this is a perfect example

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,960
of how we have a very linear set of

00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,430
steps that we follow even though there's

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,020
some conditional branches in there but

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,270
there's a very linear progression over

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,780
time that leads us from one point to

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:23,550
another from problem to solution so as

00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,010
our code moves from one step to another

00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,650
the thinking that fuels our solutions is

00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:30,690
linear it is horizontal and a lot of

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,400
times in the best cases when we are

00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,620
doing something unconventional that

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,650
maybe hasn't been done before its

00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:42,200
lateral let's talk about the vertical

00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:46,170
now that other axis we call it a stack

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,570
we vertically arrange the components of

00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:51,210
our applications and we call it a stack

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:53,430
when we have words like that you know

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:56,280
Hugh stack tree these are words that we

00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,660
might use every day and they have

00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,210
multiple meanings depending on whether

00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm pointing at you know a maple tree in

00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,200
Vancouver Canada or whether I am you

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,570
know pointing at a directory structure

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,730
for example but we call it a stack

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:12,390
because there is a vertical relationship

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:14,070
in this case ember or react or view or

00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:16,080
whatever your drug of choice is for

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,940
building your front-end is going to talk

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,520
to node nodes going to talk to Postgres

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,810
that's all sitting inside of a doctor

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,820
container running on a Linux server

00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,620
somewhere you know and I'm not even

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,110
counting in the network layer here for

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,390
how we're how we're connecting to that

00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:32,210
but it's a stack and it's very vertical

00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:34,700
we code vertically as well as

00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:37,040
horizontally all of these different

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:41,690
techniques here that we might use have

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:44,570
to do at any moment in time there's an

00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:47,210
entire relationship of our application

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:51,470
in our data at that moment in time if

00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:53,600
any click at any debug step if we were

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,430
putting breakpoints on every single line

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,420
of our code there's a vertical

00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:00,980
relationship that we have there with the

00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,820
different technologies that we brought

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:10,670
in and the interesting part about that

00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:12,170
is that becomes one of the ways that we

00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,600
have a challenge as developers our

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,520
challenge is to have our work be ignored

00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,950
when I talked about sitting down and

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,580
using an application that had a great

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,580
amount of craft to it ideally the user

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,230
should forget that someone sat down and

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,660
typed that all out the user should

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:32,120
forget that someone had to debug and

00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,310
ended up screaming at their computer the

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,600
user should forget you know whether we

00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,520
were rubber ducking to solve that

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,920
problem or whether it took a stand-up

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,080
scrum of 10 minutes like the user

00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,150
doesn't care ideally the user should

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,370
never have to think about the work that

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,990
we put into our application we're

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,750
building experiences for them we're

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,850
building products for them our problem

00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:56,060
solving in our vertical architecture

00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:58,070
should be transparent you know when we

00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,500
have DNS problems or CloudFlare goes

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,880
down or you know github is down for

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,820
whatever reason there are a lot of

00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,560
things that happen the DNS outage that

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,540
happened in eastern North America a

00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,180
couple months ago when things like that

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,710
happen it affects our users but our

00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,800
ultimate goal is that they should never

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:22,520
ever notice musicians have it just as

00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:23,840
hard unfortunately this is a bit of

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,240
music from the Mozart Violin Concerto

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,180
I've taken the liberty of applying some

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,049
green lines to where the beats of the

00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:35,989
music are as a musician especially if

00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:39,200
you are a soloist you have to make sure

00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:41,239
that as you are playing the meter of

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,340
your music the meter of the melody that

00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:45,590
you're playing lines up with your

00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,360
accompaniment you know just to go off on

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,519
your merry way and you know hope that

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,369
they catch up the same way that we

00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,049
wouldn't want our react apt to just go

00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:55,549
off and start processing things and

00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:58,039
making assumptions about data without

00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:59,860
ever actually querying the server for it

00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,659
that would be bad

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:05,389
similarly when we're thinking vertically

00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:08,749
as a musician we have the concept of

00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:11,869
harmony basically are we in tune so I've

00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:13,249
circled an E flat major chord here if

00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:16,879
you don't know what that is smile and

00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:19,999
nod but the soloist on the top line

00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:22,279
there has to make sure that that b-flat

00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:23,799
that they are playing is going to be in

00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,419
tune with the rest of the ensemble

00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:28,249
you've probably all at one point or

00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:29,330
another had to go to your nieces or

00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:31,249
nephews

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,739
you know grade six band concert or

00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:35,809
something like that and you know you had

00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:37,609
that that moment of just cringing

00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:39,080
because of the way it sounded

00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:40,399
even though you were proud of them for

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,389
what they were able to accomplish of

00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:47,899
course but tuning and being in harmony

00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:51,409
matters and so this was where my second

00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:54,830
AHA happened in thinking about this and

00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:57,799
it came comes from this quote in tune on

00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:00,649
time this quote comes from a gentleman

00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:02,179
named dr. Frederic Finnell who was a

00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:04,549
very famous conductor in the United

00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:07,639
States he was the master of bands and

00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:09,590
orchestras at Indiana University he was

00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:11,389
about this tall he was a vicious little

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,720
beast of a man but he was a brilliant

00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:17,929
musician and I had the privilege of

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,639
performing under his baton once and we

00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:22,190
were having a particularly hard day in

00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:24,440
rehearsal and he put down his baton and

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,710
he said ok I just want you to understand

00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,859
one thing the process of making music is

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:33,549
very simple and he said let me let me

00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:35,929
draw an analogy for baseball and

00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:38,450
baseball being the quote sport of

00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:40,070
America and all of that terrible way to

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,139
spend an afternoon but good beer and bad

00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,789
hotdogs

00:26:41,139 --> 00:26:46,220
he made analogy to baseball players and

00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:48,950
he said baseball players are paid

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,980
millions of dollars a year to hit

00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:54,559
one-third of the pitches that are thrown

00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:58,789
to them if they are exceptional they're

00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:02,330
hitting 333 and he said musicians on the

00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:06,020
average are barely paid minimum wage to

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:10,760
play 100% of the notes that are put in

00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:12,650
front of them this this was the the aha

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,950
moment as I remembered this quote any so

00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:18,140
what he said was musicians all we have

00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:22,159
to do to be successful is we have to

00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:24,650
play in tune on time if we can do that

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,350
the music will be beautiful everything

00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:30,020
after that is just making music this is

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,400
all the technique you ever need and so I

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,610
got to thinking about that and I got

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:39,230
thinking about this in tune on time idea

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:42,650
when it comes to my applications and so

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:46,700
I asked myself can we apply that

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:50,960
mentality to development can we strip

00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:53,450
away a lot of the the complexity that we

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,130
tend to add to the process and the

00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,860
approach of building an application and

00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:59,419
can we apply this mentality and of

00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:03,350
course another famous quote came to mind

00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:05,840
so I had to use that one and yes we can

00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:10,610
Obama got elected on these three words

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:13,039
that in Twitter but if I'm looking at

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:15,610
musicians verse developers and how how

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,250
this in tune on time idea applies

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:21,049
musicians tell a story art is how we

00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:24,230
decorate space music is how we decorate

00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:25,730
time and a performer is stringing

00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,289
together notes and melodies stacked on

00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:29,510
top of harmonies but a developer

00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:31,490
developers are offering solutions we are

00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:34,659
building products we're giving access to

00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:37,190
data the benefits users through our

00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:39,530
implementation so an algorithm

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:43,940
implemented into an architecture creates

00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:46,159
a product and so now a good user

00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,679
experience I can define this by drawing

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,990
these parallels and saying a good a user

00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:56,149
experience is one where the app runs in

00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:59,630
tune on time when it just works for the

00:28:56,149 --> 00:29:01,670
user when our approach has been to you

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:04,460
the lateral thinking to be aware of the

00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:07,190
structure the underlying architecture of

00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,990
our application to be very aware of that

00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:12,140
algorithm that's progressing from start

00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:14,630
to finish and if we can get our apps to

00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:19,070
run in tune on time then we're gonna

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:20,750
have fantastic products I do have a

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,730
shameless plug please feel free to buy

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,260
my book I just published a book about

00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:28,340
project planning putting a lot of these

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:31,160
ideas into place I'm very opinionated no

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,890
surprise I'm a developer and I'd love to

00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,870
see these ideas getting shared because I

00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,910
think they make a huge difference in the

00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:39,860
way I approach applications now and

00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,790
that's all I have to talk about to you

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,790
