Description: 
	“Move Fast & Break Things”, “Get Shit Done”, “Disrupt”.

These are mantras of the tech and design industry. They praise speed and hard work but overlook a core element: people. Let’s talk about how we can proactively care for our teammates with the same passion we use when caring for our code.

thank you I'm super excited to be here

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:17,460
today I want to start by telling you a

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:20,039
story in this story is Jake Jake's the

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,510
software engineer and he's currently

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,070
working on an ambitious new web

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,460
application and he and his team are

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,740
super excited about the project however

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,480
as often happens it's a few weeks behind

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,809
schedule and they just had to spend a

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,899
long week wrapping up the key feature

00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:38,489
now it's a Monday and Jake is feeling

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,600
extra worn out because he had to deal

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,090
with some family problems over the

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,070
weekend he would really like a day off

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,450
but he doesn't have any PTO when he

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,579
knows that the rest of his team is hard

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,550
at work so he decides to tough it out

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,020
and head into the office the first thing

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,309
he does when he gets there is check on

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,340
that poll work less you up and on Friday

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,590
he sees he got a review and wants to

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,000
check the comments on it but it turns

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,320
out there was only one comment and it

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,769
was left by a senior engineer on his

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,820
team and it says this won't work that's

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,990
it nothing else so then since he started

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,460
out pretty tired Jake's already

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,890
beginning to feel some frustration he's

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,080
thinking to himself well why won't this

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,280
work it is what was asked in I worked

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,110
hard on it but he moves on he has a

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,400
meeting coming up it's his first meeting

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,830
of the day and it's a one-on-one with

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,299
his manager he gets to the meeting a bit

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,310
early hoping that he'd be able to have

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,570
some time to talk about his frustrations

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,060
and some problems going on with the

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,790
project but as soon as his manager gets

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,070
to the door he asks Sam have you

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,270
finished feature X this feature was

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,729
supposed to be delivered last week but

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,130
due to issues with other teams he was

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,270
then able to finish it on time and so

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,950
they spend their whole time discussing

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,060
that

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,430
so when Jake leaves this meeting he's

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,110
thinking to himself no it's not finished

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,979
but that's not what I wanted to talk

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:59,340
about so it's about lunchtime now and he

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,630
heads to lunch with his teammates since

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,520
his meeting ran a bit long though by the

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,740
time he gets to the lunch table they're

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,790
already in conversation Jake's hoping

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,439
that they could talk about something

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,970
other than tech for a little bit and

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
seeing as it is on Monday he's hoping

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,400
that maybe they have some weekend

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,420
stories that they could share

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,620
however they're already in conversation

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,510
and they're talking about the latest

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,810
JavaScript framework did you hear about

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,860
new thing Jas Jade hasn't heard of this

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,970
because he was dealing with family

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,920
issues over the weekend and so he's

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,800
thinking to himself great yet another

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,970
thing that I need to go learn this feeds

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,410
into is already negative emotions about

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,550
the day there's so much going on for him

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,680
there's too much going on so it's after

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,540
lunch now and Jake really just wants to

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,730
go home so he soaks back to his death

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,370
desking kind of just fires up his text

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,590
editor he can't quite get into flow with

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,650
his work and so he checks his emails and

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,420
checks Twitter a bunch and kind of just

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,300
sits there quietly until the clock

00:02:50,420 --> 00:03:00,020
finally hits 5:00 and he feels okay I've

00:02:53,300 --> 00:03:01,520
put in a full day I can go home so how

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,800
many of you have ever had a day of like

00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,500
Jake chips did a day where you feel

00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,030
tired and worn out and like no one's

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,670
really supporting you and the

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:14,570
frustrations are having that work I know

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,490
I have Jake's story here is similar to

00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,900
parts of my own story and I imagine

00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:21,380
they're similar to many stories that

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,030
could be shared in this audience my name

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,370
is Trent Willis and I'm a senior UI

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,130
engineer at Netflix apparently and today

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,660
I want to talk about a skill that I

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,510
believe is really really important for

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,990
our industry but often crew crucially

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:38,450
undervalued that is the ability to care

00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,640
for your fellow developers you see the

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,530
tragic thing about the story with Jake

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,880
is that this one disappointing and

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,850
discouraging day can easily turn into

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,090
weeks or months of feeling worn out at

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:52,160
work this means lost productivity lower

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,780
team morale and potentially if things

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,959
are bad enough the loss of a talented

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,820
employee so how can things have gone

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,200
differently how could the interactions

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,150
that have occurred between Jake and his

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,410
co-workers have been made better without

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,060
them knowing what was going through

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,760
Jake's mine aren't necessarily going on

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,170
in Jake's personal life that's what

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,040
we're gonna explore for the remainder of

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:16,100
this talk so to start I want us to focus

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,350
on this first word caring in context

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,560
it's an action it's not a state of being

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,960
but something which you perform

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,970
in speaking with other developers and

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,280
managers I've often found that we talk

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,730
about caring or empathy and high-level

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,290
or abstract terms we don't really speak

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,720
frequently about the actions which we

00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,100
think represent someone caring and even

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,360
less do we talk about how there's

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,660
applied to people that aren't in

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,550
leadership positions the good news here

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,720
though is that since caring is an action

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,970
it means that there are some specific

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,060
acts and thought processes we can employ

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,500
to be more caring and since there are

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,180
actions that means we can practice them

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,100
and if we can practice them that means

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,930
we can get better at them and it also

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,800
means that we can work at them together

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,880
and work with each other to improve so

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,910
now's a good time for me to mention that

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,160
I'm not a caring person by nature I am

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,110
an introvert in that I get drained from

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,490
interacting with other people so being

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,490
supportive especially in emotionally

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,150
hard times is really difficult

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,820
additionally I can have a hard time

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,310
relating to others at points and often

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,490
like to keep to myself I'm sure at least

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,350
some of you know what this is like

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,270
however I've been tremendously lucky to

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,250
have wonderful people in my life

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,600
especially in the workplace that have

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,450
called me out on how I interact with

00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,180
co-workers and encourage me to be better

00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,169
at it to strive to be better so now I

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:43,330
look at it this way

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:45,700
I respect my limitations but I don't use

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,530
them as an excuse and what I mean by

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,450
this is I know that I'm gonna have to

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,250
put in a little extra bit of effort in

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,660
order to be more caring and supportive

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,419
of my teammates but that's no reason for

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,640
me not to do it we're all humans first

00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:59,770
in developers second and I definitely

00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,900
put in lots of effort and energy towards

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,039
being a better developer so it's only

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,210
reasonable that I can put in at least

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,840
some effort towards being a better

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,460
person and a more caring teammate so

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,620
with that in mind let's look at some

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,500
practical ways that we can get better at

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:18,240
caring together

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:21,280
so first up code reviews whether it's

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,729
product reviews code reviews or design

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,710
reviews the process of soliciting

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,820
feedback about decisions and then

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,560
incorporating that feedback is a

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:33,159
relatively regular part of most

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,990
developers work now there's a lot that

00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:39,090
we can say

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:40,830
about how to make code reviews more more

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,190
caring how we can be more caring in

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,110
those actions invited he covered a lot

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,360
of that in our talk earlier but I really

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,360
just want to focus on one area that is

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,750
the emotional and interpersonal aspects

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,430
of these review processes in a written

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,830
version of her talk she groups these

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,560
under a header called the harder things

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,520
but the most important which leaves us

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,960
with the question why are these the

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,360
harder things and why are they the most

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,910
important things it's because they're

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,200
almost entirely of all about people or

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,220
more specifically they're about people

00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,590
and communication and so whether it's

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,720
communication in the form of feedback or

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,540
critiques or even just a discussion

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,710
about the way something was done

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,150
communication between a reviewer and

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,030
overview II is really the Avenue by

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,100
which these reviews derive their value

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,750
if I leave a comment that's just LG TM

00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,520
looks good to me that doesn't really

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,200
tell you a whole lot right like what's

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,610
good about it or did you even really

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,100
look at it like if you don't have

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:43,250
anything specific to say how do I know

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:46,350
that you actually looked at it and so

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:49,610
with this in mind how can we incorporate

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,630
more care into our communication process

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,220
well there's a lot of things we can do

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,110
and I don't plan to try to solve the

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,150
entire gamut of interpersonal

00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,360
communication problems in a 20 minute

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:04,710
talk but I want to focus on one specific

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,720
area and that is your tone so whether

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,280
it's a review or an email or any form of

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,370
written communication we really need to

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,750
make sure that we're not being tone deaf

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,520
what I mean by this is be cognizant of

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,850
the tone that you're using when you're

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,990
communicating we've all or most of us

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,090
have likely at one point or another

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,820
interacted with someone that is it a

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,230
condescending detached or just negative

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,450
in the way that they communicate and

00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:30,960
just as those tones can be really

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,160
draining and reviews in written

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,280
communication they're also draining a

00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,990
normal conversation so we need to be

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,980
conscious that we're not letting the

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,440
fact that we're sitting behind a

00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,000
computer translate into the way that

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,220
we're communicating to our co-workers

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,800
through that computer which can often

00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:50,380
happen but to illustrate why I

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,860
tone is such an important part of our

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,600
jobs I want to share a brief story so a

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,339
little while ago I was working on a

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,470
project and it was supported by a really

00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:01,120
skilled infrastructure team the

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,860
developers on the main project would

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,839
defer to this infrastructure or support

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,800
team frequently because they had a lot

00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:10,570
of experience and expertise however some

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,130
members of this m4 team could come

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,399
across as a bit condescending or aloof

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:18,250
especially when reviewing the code of

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,019
developers that Warnock's experienced so

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,519
what resulted is that the developers

00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,709
working on this project began to avoid

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,420
the zimpher team and this led to

00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:27,220
problems in the project problems that

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,170
probably could have been avoided had

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,800
they had the insight of these more

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,350
experienced developers and so the

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,420
outcome here was that the project was

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,970
negatively and directly impacted by the

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,440
communication style of just a couple

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,899
members of this team it wasn't even the

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,579
whole team just some of them and this

00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:47,860
impacted not only the project but also

00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:50,980
relationships and the team's morale in

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,649
the long run so what can you do to make

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,850
sure that things like this don't happen

00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:56,920
well to start if you've never really put

00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,750
thought into how you communicate in the

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,720
tone that you're conveying ask your

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,149
co-workers it can either be about review

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,860
specifically or more generally about how

00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:07,600
you communicate I can almost guarantee

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:12,730
you that they would have something to

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:16,500
say to you beyond that ask them what

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,700
they think that you can do to improve in

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,579
doing this you're opening up a dialogue

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:24,670
for you guys to figure out how to work

00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:26,230
better and more effectively together but

00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,640
it's also important to realize that this

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,880
isn't going to be something that you do

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,620
once and you're done with it different

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,820
teams and different individuals within a

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,740
team are all going to have different

00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,720
communication styles and you need to

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,390
work together to find ways to improve

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,520
that communication this will let you

00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,540
collaborate more effectively grow closer

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:49,420
as a team and avoid frustration and

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,709
misunderstanding so beyond soliciting

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,540
this feedback though I also have a set

00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:54,010
of guidelines that I keep to help me

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,490
keep my tone in check while I'm

00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:00,399
communicating those are ask questions

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,330
often explain frequently and never

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,640
decree

00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,899
so by asking questions we're

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,880
acknowledging the rationality and

00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:10,720
intelligence of the other person at the

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,790
end of the review by explaining we share

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,019
context and provide opportunities for

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:18,459
others joining the conversation to learn

00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,110
and then might not de cream we avoid

00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:21,670
coming across as condescending and out

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,829
of touch with the experiences of other

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:27,010
developers which is often what it feels

00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:29,050
like so if we apply these guidelines how

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:32,320
might the review comment from the

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:34,240
beginning of Jake's day have looked well

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,800
instead of saying this won't work and

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,660
leaving it at that its coworker may have

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,610
instead chosen to say why did you

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,620
approach it this way I'm not sure this

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,440
will work because and then engine insert

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,390
is rationale so this approach to several

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,880
things first it acknowledges that Jake's

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,399
a rational and logical and intelligent

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,779
person he likely had reasons for why he

00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:56,170
chose to approach the problem the way

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:57,820
that he did second it gives an

00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,920
opportunity for the reviewer to share

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,740
context that Jake might be missing as to

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,690
why this won't work or on the other hand

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,339
it will allow Jake to see where the

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,270
reviewer is missing context that Jake

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:13,360
had while implementing the future and

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,730
then finally it shows that there was

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,790
time and care put into reviewing Jake's

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:22,870
hard work and not just being a drive by

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:24,550
where he left a flippant comment and so

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,660
the only real drawback here is that I

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,760
will have taken the review or slightly

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,529
more time to construct his review

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,959
comment but really putting in that a

00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:33,160
little bit of time is the bare necessity

00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,050
that we should be asking of someone

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,490
reviewing code that is going to be going

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:41,550
to production now there's a whole lot

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,829
more I could say about communication and

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:47,170
code reviews or reviews in general but

00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:50,410
I'll end this section with one more tip

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:53,020
about improving their tone and that is

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,540
make opportunities for praise what I

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,790
mean by this is there are chances for

00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,350
you to encourage and support and be

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,029
positive even when you have to provide

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,240
fatigues or potentially disagree with

00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:06,399
someone if nothing else simply drop in a

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,529
comment like great job or thanks for all

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,440
the hard work on this just do that from

00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:13,209
time to time a little bit of positivity

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,370
can go a long way

00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,950
constant barrage

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,870
of technical comments in critiques and

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,000
feedback can be really draining to

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,430
everyone involved but sending some

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,990
positivity can really help restore that

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,930
energy for someone that's having to be

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:30,029
reviewed this goes doubly so if you're a

00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,470
senior or a lead engineer because that

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:34,320
means there is probably someone looking

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,089
up to you and as such you should be

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,270
setting an example for how to be

00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:41,640
supportive of your teammates

00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:43,560
so moving on Jake had a slightly less

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,960
than stellar encounter in a one-on-one

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,400
meeting with his manager now this

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,200
meeting didn't necessarily need to be

00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,620
with his manager could have been with a

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,150
co-worker up here a mentor or anyone

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,740
really but the fact that it was his

00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,130
manager carried extra weight for Jake

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,810
but we also have to remember that Jake's

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,620
manager probably wasn't trying to be

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,290
malicious here

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,670
he just wanted a status update and given

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,820
the circumstances he was likely under a

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:10,860
lot of pressure to deliver as well so if

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,200
we step into the shoes of Jake's manager

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,120
here how can we make sure that we're

00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,589
being supportive while meeting with

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:22,170
someone else well the first thing that

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:24,720
we should do is try to be flexible with

00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,760
our time in one-on-one meetings that

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,380
means that this is someone that you meet

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,080
with relatively regularly or are going

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,070
to be meeting regularly it's important

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,839
to acknowledge that you're meeting with

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,140
someone else and so while you may be

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,490
coming to this meeting with a bunch of

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,440
objectives and ideas about what you want

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,550
to get out of it the person you're

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,110
meeting with is also coming with

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:49,230
expectations about what they want to get

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:51,270
out of it and so as a leader or as

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,560
someone that's leading a one-on-one then

00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,600
you should practice being flexible with

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,490
your time if they have something

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,150
important that they want to discuss make

00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,500
sure that you make some room for it if

00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,910
you have something absolutely critical

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,440
that needs to be discussed with them

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,120
though perhaps that should be another

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,290
meeting a different meeting from your

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,240
one-on-one this idea of being flexible

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,810
with your time ties into a concept of

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,630
psychological safety so back in 2012

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,910
Google did a study called Project

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,170
Aristotle that was aimed at discovering

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,750
what made certain teams more effective

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,329
than others they researched over a

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,489
hundred teams in over several years and

00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:33,660
that psychological safety was a key

00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:34,379
indicator of effective teams but what

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,499
does that mean

00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:40,230
what is psychological safety well in the

00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:42,119
field of psychology it's a group trait

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,679
that's marked by behaviors such as

00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:47,429
conversational turn-taking

00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,929
and high average social sensitivity now

00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:50,670
if you're like me and not a psychologist

00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:53,339
you might be thinking okay that doesn't

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,249
make anything any more clear so put more

00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:59,220
plainly it's a sense that your group or

00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:02,970
your team will not embarrass reject or

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:08,699
punish you for speaking up so how does

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:10,049
this tie into one-on-ones well as a as

00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,069
someone that's hosting on one-on-one it

00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:13,470
means that you have some level of

00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:15,749
influence and as someone with influence

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,269
it's your responsibility to help create

00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:21,420
a psychologically safe workplace for

00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:23,910
your co-workers and so if you are

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,470
allowing them to be able to come to you

00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,259
and feel confident that you will listen

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,720
in your one-on-one meetings by being

00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,459
flexible with your time then it will go

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,959
a long way toward setting an example for

00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:36,299
them to feel comfortable speaking up in

00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,879
all circumstances because they know that

00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:42,899
they value your voice and that they

00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:46,709
value your ability to have opinions and

00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,939
thoughts so beyond ensuring that your

00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:50,489
team feels comfortable speaking up

00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:51,509
though you also need to make sure that

00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:54,449
you're hearing what they aren't

00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:55,939
explicitly telling you so there's a

00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:57,989
quote by management guru Peter F Drucker

00:16:55,939 --> 00:17:00,110
that says the most important thing in

00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:02,610
communication is hearing what isn't said

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,679
now this quote is often used to talk

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,149
about nonverbal communication but I

00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,839
believe that it's also applicable to

00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:11,220
verbal communication you see if

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,240
someone's if you hear a bunch of

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,339
developers complaining about a problem

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,260
but they're not explicitly asking for it

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,189
to be resolved you can still guess that

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,199
there's something that needs to be done

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:21,179
there or maybe it's not that obvious

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,039
maybe you see a co-worker who's every

00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:25,079
time you talk to him is sounds really

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,220
frustrated but you don't know why but

00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,090
you do know that he's been staying late

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:33,149
at work a lot recently in both of these

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,940
cases you can identify ways to help or

00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:37,590
to care for your teammates and the first

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,960
scenario where you're hearing developers

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,970
complain escalate the problem

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,169
someone that can go fix it for them or

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,179
if you're not sure how big of an issue

00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:47,950
it is go talk to the developers and be

00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:51,279
pointed about figuring out if this is a

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:53,200
true problem for them and the latter

00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,860
scenario where your co-workers being

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,929
frustrated go talk to him see if you can

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,370
take on some of the work or if you don't

00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:02,289
have the bandwidth to do that go find

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,789
his manager and ask him hey can we get

00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,279
more developers to help this guy out so

00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:08,830
he doesn't have to stay late or hey can

00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,299
we get more or we can we change the

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,679
expectations on when these things need

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:14,529
to be delivered so that way he doesn't

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,380
feel all this pressure the point is is

00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:19,179
that if you stop and look there are

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,700
likely things going on in your team that

00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:27,370
could be made better if someone took the

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:30,100
time to notice them so let's consider

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:32,289
Jake's earlier meeting instead of asking

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,700
about feature acts right away what if

00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:36,220
his manager had started their meeting by

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,500
asking by saying I have something I'd

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,730
like to talk about but first is there

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,330
anything that you would like to talk

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,919
about this way Jake knows that there's

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,779
an opportunity there for him to talk

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,770
about his frustrations especially if

00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:50,590
there's something that's really weighing

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,970
on him it's important that his manager

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,500
doesn't say something like I have

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,299
something very important that I want to

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,970
talk about because if he does that then

00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:59,620
Jake may be like well am i my problems

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,500
really that important maybe they can

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,240
wait on the flip side of this coin

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,590
though Jake needs to recognize that

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,679
there is something his manager wants to

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,120
talk about and so if they use up all

00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:11,770
their time in the meeting talking about

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,149
Jake's frustrations then they should

00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,850
schedule another meeting

00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:17,799
Jake should offer this carrying goes

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:21,789
both ways and it's up to both parties to

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,919
recognize this now he might question at

00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:25,720
this point if this always makes sense

00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,429
right what if the manager has a really

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,010
critical business topic that's blocking

00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:32,799
another team or what if Jake's

00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:34,659
frustrations can't be resolved well

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,890
you'll need to use your best judgment I

00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:37,720
mean as with most things in software

00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:41,590
engineering there's no one solution to

00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,480
everything but be careful because small

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,100
problems and small frustrations have a

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,049
habit of snowballing and turning into

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:51,970
much larger issues now there's plenty

00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:53,139
more that I could talk about in terms of

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,400
meetings in building effective

00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:55,960
one-on-one meetings

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,410
but I want to end this section with one

00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,910
more tip let us go for a walk if you've

00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,090
never done it before try taking a walk

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,170
during our one-on-ones anecdotally

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,360
speaking they can feel a lot more

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,180
relaxed and laid-back than sitting in a

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,020
cold conference room across from someone

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,820
and especially if you have something

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,380
difficult to discuss it can be a lot

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,570
easier to do that while you're looking

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,330
at your feet or looking at the beautiful

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,590
scenery around you instead of sitting in

00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:25,930
a cold conference room staring into

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:27,040
someone's eyes that said make sure that

00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,180
you take into account the person you're

00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,250
meeting with this won't work for

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,930
everyone and so you should communicate

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:36,450
with each other to find a structure that

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:38,940
is effective and useful for both of you

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:43,990
so we've now talked about two specific

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:45,460
work-related tasks that come up but what

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,660
about other day-to-day activities if

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,280
you're a developer chances are you don't

00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,500
spend your whole day in meetings or

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,810
doing code reviews well at least I

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,220
should hope not so how do you care for

00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,010
your teammates if you're just getting

00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,610
lunch or chatting about tech or simply

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,080
doing a lull in the day at your desks

00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:05,710
well my first tip here is to close the

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,330
shop as high-performing and really

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,010
motivated individuals it can be really

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:13,030
easy for us to want to talk about work

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:14,590
or talk shop all the time and especially

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,240
in the tech industry I've met tons of

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,130
people especially at conferences like

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,230
this that love what they do and love

00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:23,320
their jobs and that is fantastic I'm

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:25,960
super happy about that but if that's all

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,610
that I ever know about people then I'm

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,680
missing out on critical opportunities to

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,200
build memories and stronger bonds and

00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,370
connections with my teammates

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,350
that means we're missing out on chances

00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,060
to build more collaborative teams that

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,070
can work more effectively together and

00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,040
therefore deliver better products in the

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,470
end so we should inquire about family

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,970
and friends ask about their hobbies talk

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,250
about local events or maybe even ask

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,690
them about their favorite Netflix series

00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:55,300
the possibilities really are almost

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:58,240
endless so if we think about Jake's

00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,710
earlier lunch conversation what if

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,750
instead of say talking about new thing

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,160
JSL lunches co-workers opened up by

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,950
talking about know what everyone had

00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,300
done over the weekend maybe jake would

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,380
have a chance to open up about how he's

00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,360
feeling with the project

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,450
if his co-workers are feeling the same

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,950
way they can commiserate about it or if

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,660
he feels that's too personal he can

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,309
always sit back and hear about what's

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,410
going on in the lives of his co-workers

00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:23,830
and find a way to connect with him that

00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:26,320
way now this isn't to say that you

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:30,630
should never talk about work especially

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,880
if you enjoy work outside of the office

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,169
but it is to say that try to put naam

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,870
work things at the forefront every now

00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:39,280
and then so I guess more accurately

00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,470
instead of closing the shop close the

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,500
shop occasionally don't shut it down

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,480
permanently and I think you'll be

00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,860
surprised by how easy it is to find

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,059
other things to talk about once you

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,240
begin to understand your co-workers

00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:54,190
apart from their role at the office and

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,900
those close this goes a long way towards

00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,490
helping build a psychologically safe

00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,679
workplace because it's letting your

00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,150
co-workers know that hey you have value

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,559
to me outside of the function that

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:08,140
you're fulfilling it while you're in the

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:10,059
office so at this point it could feel

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,890
like I'm prescribing a bunch of steps or

00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:13,750
a bunch of things that you have to do

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,490
checkboxes to check in order to build a

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,890
caring and effective team but that's not

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,710
really the goal my goal in this talk is

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:23,049
to provide examples examples of how we

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:26,049
translate this amorphous concept of

00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:27,490
caring or being empathetic and turn them

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:29,110
into concrete actions that we can think

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:33,669
about in practice or start incorporating

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:36,220
into the work life so I think author Bob

00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:38,020
goft expressed the idea that for me lies

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,530
behind all of this really succinctly in

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:43,600
a book that he has called love does and

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,780
he says you don't need a plan you just

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,600
need to be present what does it mean to

00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:51,159
be present in this context though well

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,230
it's not really so much about a specific

00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:58,059
moment or a location in time it's about

00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:59,650
the environment in the workplace setting

00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:03,070
that you find yourself in your teammates

00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:05,020
in there's this intersection of yourself

00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,409
and the unique personalities of your

00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,700
teammates and your work circumstances

00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:12,429
that is really the present moment for

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,020
you so being present allows you to see

00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:15,520
how the review comment you're about to

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,360
leave might be interpreted negatively by

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,500
your teammate or it will allow you to

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,820
see that the person you're meeting with

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:27,159
is looking worn out and

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:28,419
needs a break and it also lets you

00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,899
recognize when your team is ready to

00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:33,429
celebrate a victory and this that last

00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:34,600
item is really important because it

00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,580
would be really easy to get the idea

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,710
from this talk that caring only matters

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:42,279
when bad stuff is happening analysis but

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,950
that's not true accomplishments

00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:47,590
victories celebrations they all need to

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,970
be shared because otherwise if you're

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,350
only around when bad stuff is happening

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,759
to your coworkers are there looking

00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,259
stressed out and you're basically just a

00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:57,489
bad omen and that's not a good team pain

00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:01,210
so remember how Jake just kind of soaked

00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:02,769
back to his desk after lunch we've all

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,679
likely seen co-workers in the similar

00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:07,779
situation whether it's increased sighing

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,809
or longer stares off into space or maybe

00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:12,669
more cursing or abnormal quietness

00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:14,349
they're usually signs when people are

00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:18,129
feeling off or feeling down about what's

00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:19,989
going on in their job being present and

00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:21,729
actively giving them some attention from

00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:25,200
time to time allows us to recognize when

00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:27,369
people look off that's really important

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,899
now when we recognize people look off

00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:31,090
though it's really easy for us to think

00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:33,399
oh I'm just gonna pretend that doesn't

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,169
exist and ignore it because it's

00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:38,289
comfortable like we don't want to get

00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:40,659
involved in other people's mess however

00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:43,509
I would encourage you to take a deep

00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:46,029
breath and then lean in and simply ask

00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:48,429
him hey are you doing okay is there

00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:50,289
anything you want to talk about or maybe

00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:51,820
make it a bit more personal I don't know

00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:56,349
hey you've been a bit more quiet than

00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,489
usual hey is everything okay sometimes

00:25:56,349 --> 00:26:00,429
that's all it takes to turn someone's

00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:02,590
day or entire we compound just knowing

00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:04,470
that someone wants to listen they may

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:07,840
not necessarily open up so don't push it

00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:09,129
they don't have to tell you anything but

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,789
let them know that you're there and that

00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:14,979
you care and you're available so as a

00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:17,470
brief example of this one of the closest

00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:20,649
co-workers I ever had loved Martinelli's

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:23,470
apple juice as do I but they didn't

00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:25,330
stock it in the building that we worked

00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:28,359
in I know this is a Silicon Valley

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:31,029
problem but they stopped it in a

00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,529
building across our campus and so we

00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:35,440
would often go for some walks to get

00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:37,090
some apple juice on this walk which only

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,980
a couple of minutes was a chance for us

00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:40,299
to talk openly about whatever we wanted

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,629
without fear of other people being

00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:46,059
around we could vent if we were really

00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:48,899
frustrated about something or we could

00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:51,279
talk enthusiastically about something

00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:55,899
the point is that there was always an

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,759
open invitation there to talk but there

00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:59,769
was never an expectation and that

00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,289
difference between expectation and

00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:03,940
invitation is really important because

00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:06,429
there is a sense that hey I have someone

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,740
I can go to if I need but I can also

00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:09,730
keep to myself if I want it has an

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:14,980
introvert that's really important

00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:16,710
because I think my privacy so all of

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:20,049
this leads me to my final word of advice

00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:22,450
that is be available and be open when I

00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:24,279
asked a group of managers and developers

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,629
what they thought a developer should do

00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,639
to be a more caring and more empathetic

00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:28,960
teammate almost half of them said

00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:30,940
something along the lines of be

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,580
available for your teammates and be open

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,350
when you respond to them the reasoning

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,970
here is that being available makes you

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,409
really approachable and can help you

00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,169
build relationships with your teammates

00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:42,759
if you're never around or never at your

00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:44,350
desk and people don't know how to get

00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,539
ahold of you then it may come across as

00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:48,519
if you're too busy you're too important

00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,899
for your teammates that you don't really

00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:54,220
care about them their needs aren't as

00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:56,830
important to you so make some time try

00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,629
to be around and try to be available but

00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,429
if you have to be at a lot of meetings

00:27:58,629 --> 00:28:02,350
as I know some managers and lead EV do

00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,759
then just let them know that you would

00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:06,190
prioritize requests from them to mean

00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,019
let them know that your priority even if

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,860
you can't physically be near them

00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:13,240
frequently and then when you do respond

00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,590
in these circumstances it's really

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,379
important that you're open with the

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:20,320
information you're giving most

00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:22,149
developers are astute people and they

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,789
can tell if someone is holding back

00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:26,289
information or just giving them just

00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:29,159
enough so that way you leave them alone

00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:31,330
and that breeds a lot of distrust right

00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,799
because it's telling them hey I don't

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,750
have confidence in you to give you the

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,480
whole story or I don't have time to be

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:39,610
bothered giving you the whole story

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,679
so be open try to give until they seem

00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:43,419
satisfied with your response and not

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,149
necessarily when you think that they

00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:47,110
should be satisfied with your response I

00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:49,270
know for myself this can be really

00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,800
difficult if I have a big project

00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,240
I need to finish or have a lot of

00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,710
meetings for whatever reason it could be

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,830
really easy for me to just want to brush

00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,170
people off but I found that taking a

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,280
little bit of extra time to like

00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:02,050
actually communicate effectively with

00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,570
them goes a long way towards building

00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:06,760
better relationships and building them

00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,500
into better developers because it

00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,060
transfers knowledge to them and lets

00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:14,680
them know that hey I have confidence in

00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:16,120
you I trust you to do your job well to

00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,170
this advice though of being available

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,350
and being open I would also not be

00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,730
encouraging as with praise in the review

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:24,400
process a little bit of encouragement

00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,050
can go a long way if a junior dev is

00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,890
coming to you asking questions about how

00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,630
to implement feature

00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,040
inter conversation by letting them know

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,350
that you're excited to see how it turns

00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,870
out or if you have to work on a hard

00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,370
problem with a peer let them know that

00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:39,250
you're thankful that they're working on

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,510
it with you and investing the time or

00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,890
maybe you find yourself asking a lot of

00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,230
questions from a lead developer or

00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,880
senior engineer and let them know hey

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:49,240
thank you for taking the time to help me

00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:52,000
and it's really benefiting me many of us

00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,160
are expected to do good work and that's

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,450
why we have jobs but just because we're

00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,860
expected to do it doesn't mean it

00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,040
shouldn't be recognized and encouraged

00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,990
whenever we see it it really takes a

00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,580
very small amount of energy to say some

00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,170
positive words to someone but the amount

00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,720
of energy that that imparts to the other

00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,740
person can be really tremendous and

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,010
could help them be so much more

00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,660
productive so to wrap up I want to

00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:17,020
mention a quote by the paragon of

00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,970
Silicon Valley Steve Jobs he says he

00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,680
once said great things in business are

00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,140
never done by one person they're done by

00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,330
a team of people and that last word to

00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:29,490
me is super critical to the sentiment

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:33,940
expressed here we're not UI engineers or

00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:36,040
senior developers or even employees but

00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,300
we are human those titles might be part

00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,500
of how we think about ourselves but

00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,490
they're not really part of our being

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,990
it's just something that we happen to do

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,490
so I urge you all to put forth a little

00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,380
bit of extra effort every day to care

00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,750
more for your fellow developers your

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,970
fellow people and I think you'll be

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,800
surprised by how much more effective

00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:59,230
your team will become and how much

00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:01,540
better people will grow so maybe instead

00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,400
of focusing on getting done as we

00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:06,210
are off to say and

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,490
industry we focus on growing people my

00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,230
hope is that this talk has shown that

00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,730
being more caring or more empathetic

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,400
doesn't require you to completely change

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:17,250
your personality also doesn't require a

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,440
lot of fancy process but it does require

00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,450
you to put yourself in the shoes of your

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,720
co-workers and understand what makes

00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,720
them unique

00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,050
my hope is that this little bit of extra

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,940
effort that we put in will help you

00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,320
experience a team that grows so much

00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,770
more than you ever have before

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,600
and from that labor from that growing of

00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:39,210
other people we can begin to go farther

00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:42,030
than we ever have before in both in the

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:43,380
workplace and beyond because there is

00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:46,070
really so much more to this life than

00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:50,230
just work thank you

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,230
