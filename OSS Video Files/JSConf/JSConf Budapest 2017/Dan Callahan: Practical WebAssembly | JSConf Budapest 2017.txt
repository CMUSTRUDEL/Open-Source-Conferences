Title: Dan Callahan: Practical WebAssembly | JSConf Budapest 2017
Publication date: 2017-12-01
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2017
Description: 
	WebAssembly is a new low-level, high-performance complement to JavaScript on the Web. As an open standard developed by Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, WebAssembly runs everywhere that JavaScript does: in every major Web browser, and in runtimes like Node.js and Electron. This talk examines WebAssembly from a practical standpoint, answering why it was created, what itâ€™s good for, how it works, and how you can use it today.
