days and you can also DM e on Twitter I

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,119
would like to tell you the story of my

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,430
life as short as possible my school was

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,860
pretty clear that I'm different to other

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,259
kids I read books in the breaks

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,189
I had a gossip wearing only black

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:23,400
clothes reading mangas and skateboarding

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,900
and so on and I was bullied for who I am

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,390
and what I am and I started to

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:33,479
questioning myself what is wrong with me

00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,280
what did I wrong and I came to the

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,729
conclusion my behavior must be wrong

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,320
this is why no one likes me and I should

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,180
stop being the creep sitting in the

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,579
breaks on a bench while reading Harry

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,119
Potter I should stop skating and I

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,009
should stop being myself I tried to fit

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,649
in the role of the teenage girl but it

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:56,820
doesn't work out and I felt like a fraud

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,649
and faking my way through it and my time

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,560
at school was close to horrible and I

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,360
was happy when I lived at school but

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,250
when I started working it doesn't make a

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,270
huge difference for me I wasn't bullied

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,430
anymore which was kind of good I think

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,819
but I still was not a real part of the

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,019
group and why my colleagues went out for

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,849
after work party I was heading back home

00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:21,469
we have some nice chats at the coffee

00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,959
machine at work but I figured out that

00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:27,560
we do not share any interests and again

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:30,769
I try to fill in and try to talk about

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,079
TV series where I only read the last

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:35,540
news about it so that I can talk about

00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:40,010
it but it felt so wrong again and I

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,510
asked myself what's wrong with me after

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,959
a long journey and different jobs I

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,900
quitted

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,730
I started studying and within my time at

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,250
university I found the Open Text school

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,180
and joined the programming workshops the

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,340
open takes care is a nonprofit

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,489
organization who teaches people how to

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,060
code and in my case it was HTML CSS and

00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:00,829
also JavaScript for beginners it was the

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,049
first time in my life that I belonged to

00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:05,150
a group of people and they accepted me

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,790
for who I am and gave me a good feeling

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,819
about switching my careers and become a

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:14,359
front-end developer they told everyone

00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:16,909
there you belong here and Here I am at

00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:18,650
EJ's computer patch as a Defra and also

00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:20,150
a front-end they'll work I'm very happy

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,540
that a lot of people from the open tech

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,159
school are still in my life since I'm a

00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,260
front-end developer I get in touch with

00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:29,090
awesome talented people and I was

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,629
thrilled about how fast you can learn

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,310
how to build a website with HTML and CSS

00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:38,329
my love incur a learning curve was like

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,579
this you see the period of time and the

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,459
things I've learned and it was an

00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:47,629
amazing feeling to learn so much in this

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:51,139
short period of time but after couple of

00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:53,510
month it was like this the feeling

00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,639
stepping on the same spot was horrible I

00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,430
compared myself to the people I've met

00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:01,280
and it feels like I'm absolutely stupid

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,620
it was hard to leave the comfort zone

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,530
and tasked with new program and stuff

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,840
overwhelmed me very fast and at least I

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,349
try to get tasks who were very easy for

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,930
me and I would things I have no idea of

00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,909
gives me the feeling I have no idea what

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,090
I'm doing here and I do not belong here

00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:22,940
I started to work harder on my own

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:25,219
skills when I came back from home I sat

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,360
down at my desk and try to solve the

00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:31,650
programming problems I had during the

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:35,310
and my day was like eight hours of work

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:39,479
at work for up to six hours at work at

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,000
home and nightmares about work at night

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,560
and it doesn't work out and I just

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,830
talked about it with a friend of mine

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,330
and he was like what's wrong everything

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,310
is awesome you're doing a great job

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,819
you've achieved so much in this short

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,469
period of time and it feels like this

00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:58,770
everyone is better than me I'm never

00:04:55,469 --> 00:05:00,840
good enough and I'm overwhelmed I told

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,849
him but he still was like it's only in

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,509
your head stop worrying you're doing

00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:06,270
great

00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:09,419
I started researching where my doubts

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,310
are coming from and I just stumbled over

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,590
a book blog post about the impostor

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,090
syndrome and I was only scratching on

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,900
the surface what the impostor syndrome

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,729
is about and read a lot about it while

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,650
doing my research I found a lot of

00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,419
multiple-choice tests and the most asked

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,050
questions were maybe you can ask

00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:30,750
yourself right now if you would like to

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:34,409
that's everyone overestimates you hell

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,870
yes I get paid for a job and I think I

00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:39,300
do not know enough about it to get paid

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:43,979
for it so yes everyone is overestimating

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:46,710
me so yes do you tend to discuss

00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:50,250
yourself I was thinking about that and

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,080
every time I'm doing something new I'm

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,050
questioning is this the right thing

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,139
you're doing right now this the correct

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:03,060
path you go you're going right now it

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:04,979
was like yes of course the next thing is

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,479
you compare your ability to those around

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,240
you and think they are more intelligent

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,759
than you are as I mentioned I met a lot

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,069
of amazing talented and intelligent

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,219
people and I compare myself every time

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:19,229
to those and when it comes at work to

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:21,150
some coding discussions and I'm sitting

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:25,050
there like this oh my god what they are

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,089
right now I have no idea so yes I think

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,629
everyone else is more intelligent than

00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:32,279
me that's the fear of failure freaks you

00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:35,069
out hell yes

00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:38,430
last week I organized the conference and

00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:41,129
on Friday I heated by Coleman I was

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,229
terrified of fear well

00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:45,419
this conference work out do I have

00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:47,129
everything there what my speakers need

00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:49,259
the attendants need and I was freaking

00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:50,959
out so yes the fear of failure freaks me

00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:55,649
the hell out of me

00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:57,869
do you decline your own success yes one

00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,939
more time my conference what

00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:02,249
Sunday in the evening I was thinking

00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,319
there have a have a cup of coffee and

00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:06,059
everyone was like oh my god it was so

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,719
cool it was nice to meet you it was a

00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:12,419
cool conference I was like I see what

00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:15,059
went wrong so it was not that good as

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:17,990
you see as you say to me so yes I

00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:20,669
declare my own use my own success

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,619
the next thing sometimes you afraid

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,229
others will discover how much knowledge

00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:27,409
you really lack it's the same thing I

00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:30,479
told you before when it come up to

00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:32,399
calling discussions at work I should

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,069
shut my mouth because I'm afraid that

00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,659
someone will tell me oh no no no you're

00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:41,219
not right and that's lack of knowledge

00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:43,619
so next point yes you are only

00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:46,079
successful because you were on the right

00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:49,019
time at the right place are you only

00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,869
knew the right people yes of course I'm

00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:54,240
only I could only stand here because I

00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:58,439
met the people of the RTS of the open

00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,419
tech school so absolutely you can't

00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,329
understand the compliments you receive

00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,309
hell yes that's the most annoying thing

00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:06,899
I have got in my life I can't understand

00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:09,269
some compliments I received I'm

00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:14,269
discussing them the whole time and I

00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:17,129
make me myself as tiny as I can so yes

00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:19,919
you feel bad when you're not the best or

00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:23,610
at least very special I have to think

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:27,149
about that again but it's not that worse

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,279
for me but at least I try to be the best

00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:32,399
and I can get very angry of myself when

00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:35,370
I'm not very special sometimes or I'm

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,300
not the best so yeah it works out for me

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,069
as well you avoid evaluations if

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,120
possible and have a dread of others

00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:47,189
evaluations evaluating you evaluations

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,490
can be horrible especially when it came

00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:53,220
to the point where I have to elevate if

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,190
evaluate other people and my opinion I'm

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,810
not skilled enough to

00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,860
how people how good about that job was

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:04,030
so yes do you focus more on what you

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:07,030
haven't done I think yeah I'm

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:09,160
questioning myself again and again did I

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,380
organized everything as everything there

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,330
for my speakers this my talk right now

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:17,440
am I prepared for my talk right now so

00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:19,450
I'm focusing I didn't do a dry run today

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,600
in the morning so why didn't I do that

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:25,560
and this is why what I was focusing on

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,770
and in the in the speaker room so yes

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,260
whoo 10 points to Gryffindor but well

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,540
now now I know that I'm suffering from

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,640
something I have no real idea about and

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,930
this was the time where I started to

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,150
take a deep dive and through the

00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,890
imposter thing and I figured out why

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:45,940
reading all the blog posts and papers

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:50,170
what I'm doing to myself I sabotage

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:52,480
myself let that sink in I have immense

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:55,210
fear of failure but at the same time I'm

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,700
terrified of success and I want to prove

00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:02,260
my worth but I worry I don't deserve the

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:05,980
success of compliments I receive and not

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,900
likely to ask for a race since I don't

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:12,730
see myself as competent I don't think

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:15,100
I'm worth more money so and people like

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,350
me to turn tend to work really hard as

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,240
mentioned before I said high standards

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,610
for myself and try my best to reach them

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,760
but no matter how much validation I

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,830
receive I've never felt competent too

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,090
long didn't listen it's the thinking

00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,840
that makes me believe I'm actually

00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:33,220
incompetent and intelligent and lazy I'm

00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,110
convinced that I'm convinced that I'm

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,839
faking my way through my accomplishments

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:40,900
and it's the fear I will be exposed at

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,640
the fraud I believe I am when I figured

00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,140
out all the things I started thinking

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,080
about how to stop it in my head

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:50,140
some people think I'm worth my money and

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,170
some people think that I belong here so

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,690
I could not be that bad I think so I

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:58,870
started researching again researching

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,270
assisting for me so while doing research

00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,730
Alliance some techniques which helps me

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,940
to escape the bed zone and accept the

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:08,030
fact that it's not at worse as it seems

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,100
you will never be able

00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:13,220
to get rid of it completely but it you

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,660
can make it feel less bad and before I

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,360
will talk about the techniques I

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,490
discovered over the time I would like to

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,620
show you a saying which describes why I

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:26,750
struggled so much in my life the reasons

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,970
we struggle with insecurity is because

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:32,480
we compare our behind the scenes with

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,940
everyone else's highlight reel this one

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,400
was right in the fields I was comparing

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,960
myself the whole time with other people

00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,260
and when I read that quote I realized

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,090
that I was barking up the wrong tree

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,520
Facebook is the best example to see the

00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:50,240
highlights real of everyone holiday

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,160
photos some nice dish then photos with

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,170
the significant other where everyone is

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,390
laughing and only have a great time and

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:59,810
you're sitting then ask yourself why do

00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:02,000
they have such a awesome life and you're

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:05,420
sitting here on your desk and sobbing in

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,840
worries all the time now I've got the

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,980
quote in my in my phone in my notes and

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,170
when I'm thinking about that everyone

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,070
else is living a better life than me I

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:18,940
only read that it makes me feel better

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:23,060
and maybe it helps you too

00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:25,190
so stop comparing yourself to others you

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,790
an individual and you're worth every

00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,850
penny

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,400
or compliment you receive having idols

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,620
is a good thing but they are not you

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,510
they are not walking in your shoes and

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,810
they've made different experiences as

00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:41,030
you and maybe they think that they are

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,370
frauds - you don't know you only see the

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:46,820
good Facebook post on social media and

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:49,990
you aren't born to live a life of

00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,430
another person you as perfect as you are

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,220
next thing is everything is only in your

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:57,380
hat people who are working with you will

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,060
acknowledge your work they appreciate

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,510
you as the person who you are and they

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,710
will tell you when something went wrong

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,870
except the compliments you receive

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:10,610
because people are criticized faster

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:12,920
instead of praising you and imposes try

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:16,550
to be perfect when something is not

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,880
perfect it's not properly done right so

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,820
learn to be a healthy perfectionist most

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,800
things are done the product better than

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,860
effect and stop worrying excessively

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,980
about mistakes or setbacks sometimes you

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:33,190
have to ask yourself what would I do if

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,470
I was not afraid I asked myself in the

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,950
last few weeks would I ask my boss for a

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,520
raise

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:41,890
ask the cute person in front of me out

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,200
start a new project and there are a lot

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,360
of questions you can ask yourself like

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,600
in the same way when the fear kicks in

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,700
and if this doesn't work out for you ask

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,600
the right people to help you out with

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,100
your problem learn to ask for advice it

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
can be really hard in the beginning but

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,140
a lot of people are really happy to help

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,660
you out you don't have to prove that you

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:08,500
can solve every problem on your own

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:11,650
I started mentoring people in August and

00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,840
September and at least I was a mentor at

00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,970
two events right now and guess what

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,060
people will ask questions you cannot

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,800
answer and you cannot answer them but

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,200
that's good you don't know you don't

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,390
have to know everything Stack Overflow

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,810
or documentation can be your best

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:32,500
friends and it's a good thing to know

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:35,500
what you don't know is that's still not

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,840
enough to overcome the bad feelings talk

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,670
about it if you want to I'm helping

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,840
myself right now when I'm talking about

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:46,600
it maybe you're not into speaking to a

00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,520
huge crowd like me right now but it

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,030
helps you to keep you aware that he was

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,760
suffering from something and especially

00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,500
your friends can be really supportive

00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,710
and help you out with your problem you

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,770
only have one thing to do bribe your

00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:04,690
friends every time one of your friends

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:07,360
point out that you're under estimating

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,450
yourself spend them a cup of coffee or

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,370
maybe a beer but one thing I can tell

00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,620
you it can be very expensive in the

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:18,790
beginning and maybe you should switch to

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:20,170
water and and some tea because your

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,300
friends will suffer from too much

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,040
caffeine or beer and with tea and water

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:29,410
they only have to pee a lot so that's

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:32,380
fine being wrong or not perfect doesn't

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:35,400
make you a fraud just keep in mind the

00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,080
best circuit teams lose but

00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,990
they are not frauds they know how to

00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,240
kick the ball right oh there are many

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,660
million dollar companies that sometimes

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,760
fail as well evaluate the impact or what

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,920
could go wrong by asking yourself what's

00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,800
the worst thing that can happen to me

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,840
right now this will help to elevate the

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,330
fear and the most things we're doing

00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,920
happen I have not a huge impact

00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,810
especially in tech we create software

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,820
for customers and maybe they are not

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,580
amused about a missed deadline but hey

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,900
we're humans not machines

00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,870
we should start focusing on providing

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,810
value and write down your achievements

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:15,420
of the day this one is out of my

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:18,030
sketchbook at home and it's a smallest

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,130
for me from the last week I helped out

00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,960
an elderly person to enter the tray to

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,030
enter the train I organized the

00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,490
conference on my own I teach my

00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,810
colleagues something I know I cooked a

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,850
really delicious meal for me and my

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,910
friends I denote a really good part of

00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:35,160
code and this can be written down in a

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,990
diary only at a Google Doc it's up to

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,560
you where you write it down especially

00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:43,800
the small things matter - like those

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,650
ones keep a file of nice things someone

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,870
was saying about you can you remember

00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:51,240
the last time when you received a

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,840
compliment and know exactly the wording

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,090
no me neither

00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,590
we forgotten too often the good parts in

00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,630
life and this is why you should take

00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,570
maybe screenshots and save them when

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,950
someone writes something good about you

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,050
make notes in your phone when someone

00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,490
gives you an awesome compliment take a

00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:12,120
look at it when you're feeling like a

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:15,330
fraud and what helps me the most stop

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,130
commenting compliments really just stop

00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,560
it never do this again

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,450
just stop it I was a person who was

00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,610
discussing my saw my other compliments

00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,010
every time and it helped me a lot to

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:28,140
appreciate myself and the work I was

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,600
doing when I stopped commenting on

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,840
compliments if the sender a friendly

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,850
smile and say thank you for that and

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,990
before your thoughts start spinning take

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,600
a look at what you've done for the

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,010
person which gives you the compliment

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,810
ask yourself what the person give me a

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:47,160
compliment if my work was as bad as I

00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:49,190
think yes answer is no in 99% and the

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,940
other 1% of people we would not like to

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:55,880
about the last thing is take time for

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,820
yourself if everything feels horrible

00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,670
and me and you are freaking out on the

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,920
inside do what you enjoy the most for me

00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,290
it's like taking a hot bath or grab a

00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:10,280
good book have some quality time for

00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:12,200
myself come down from the day and forget

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,590
for a short period of time the cold

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,450
feeling if you're freaking out in your

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,780
office maybe get a cup of tea take a

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:23,570
break do sit-ups tap the office dock

00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:26,900
maybe whatever works out for you to calm

00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:30,320
down let's start over with the good

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:34,520
parts of being an impostor and you think

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:37,100
maybe now wait what she was telling us

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,800
the whole time that she suffers from it

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,390
and now there are good parts of it

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,270
sometimes it's not that bad to suffer

00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:47,300
from the imposter syndrome to be an

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,040
overachiever is not that bad at least we

00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:52,400
try to be as perfect as possible and

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,740
everything we do so from time to time we

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,410
have to take a step back calm down and

00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,930
live with the result which is maybe not

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:01,880
the perfect solution but if we can

00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,770
accept it that we don't have to be

00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:08,090
perfect that's not that bad to be an

00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:09,590
overachiever do you know people who

00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,230
think they are the best and everything

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,680
they doing and after a few sentences you

00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:18,470
you talk to them you think they're not

00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,120
the brightest candle on the cake those

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,160
people are in my opinion very annoying

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,260
and this is why I think when you

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,820
underestimate yourself from time to time

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,340
and promote it to the people it's not

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,350
that bad it's better to surprise the

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,180
people with what you've done and

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,220
achieved instead of disappointing them

00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,630
with what they've expected from you

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:40,850
because you're overestimated yourself

00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:43,880
maybe you're not suffering from the

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,430
imposter syndrome but after hearing the

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,050
symptoms you're asking yourself I think

00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,890
a friend of mine is suffering from the

00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,760
impostor syndrome what can I do

00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,130
maybe someone tells you that they

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,110
feeling like a fraud faking everything

00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,810
are they not good enough for the money

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:02,220
they get and you should not say hey I

00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,049
was last week at the jeaious computer

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,970
just listen to a talk about the imposter

00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:09,870
syndrome you ain't imposed to deal with

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:12,240
it don't do that to anyone they will

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,770
start researching like me and spend a

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,590
lot of time with it because the first

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:21,030
blog post I read had the title you the

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:22,740
imposter and I was like oh wow and the

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:26,309
worrying journey kicks in really badly

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,659
don't do that to anyone instead of

00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:31,289
telling them that they are suffering

00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:32,640
give them reasonable feedback maybe a

00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:34,530
colleague of you is questioning

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,460
themselves the whole time and ask is

00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:40,110
this okay what I'm doing or maybe can

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,210
you take a look at my code again please

00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:45,780
and this more frequently than other

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,010
colleagues do take your time and explain

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,419
them that the work is good and

00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:54,030
especially explain them the why maybe

00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:55,919
the work is not perfect but you Kevin it

00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:59,039
can tell them too that they can improve

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,250
here and there something but also with

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,860
the Y complimenting people only because

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:08,039
of the fears is not really helpful don't

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,230
compliment them only make only to make

00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:12,450
them feel better explain them the why

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:15,000
you think like this and the why is the

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,490
most important thing but you can also

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,220
help them with if you talk about your

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,110
own fears if you feel uncomfortable with

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,330
it show the people that they are not

00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:27,750
along with their problems maybe you're

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:30,210
working at a project and you've got a

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,100
deadline and every one of you knows

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,960
customers right they can get really

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,520
angry when you have to say oh my god no

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,039
in the end of the week it will not work

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,120
out we need one another week so and

00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:43,679
there nope we pay for you so at least

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,470
deal with it in the end of the week of

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,809
the project have to be finished maybe

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,760
you can tell your colleague who may be

00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,679
suffering from the impostor syndrome oh

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,360
my god deadline in the end of the week

00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,179
of course I'm afraid something went

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,669
wrong when we deploy it to production

00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:03,690
are you using a new framework maybe

00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:05,940
react angular 1 Z J's whatever you can

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,039
say oh I've never done this before and

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,240
I'm also afraid of wool what will not

00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,370
work out in the end

00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,309
shall the people they do not have to

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,840
fight the battles alone to come to an

00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:16,110
end with this talk I would like to show

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,020
you

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:22,350
beautiful phrase I heard while watching

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:25,200
Kung Fu Panda this phrase describes so

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:29,280
much how you escape the zone and what

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,890
you should focus on Okwe the turtle said

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,500
to the Panda you're too concerned with

00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:37,200
what was and what will be there's the

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,320
saying yes there is yesterday's history

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,610
tomorrow's a mystery but today is a gift

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,890
that's why it's called the present if we

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,860
read over and over that saying thinks

00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,750
getting less bad we are thinking the

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,850
whole time what we've done wrong and

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,840
maybe we can see the opportunities we

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:59,880
missed every day because of worrying

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,820
last but not least when we start over a

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,610
new job maybe ask ourselves was this the

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,620
right decision job offers do not cover

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:10,020
everything we are able to do contain

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,030
things we've never done but we are

00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,059
applying for this job because every job

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:17,100
offers nearly the same right but there's

00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:19,830
never be a perfect fit for everyone and

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,559
this is why I would like to say to you

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:25,020
to be an imposter is not the exception

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,500
it's a rule and everyone suffers from it

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:30,180
from time to time thank you

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,509
[Applause]

00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,509
