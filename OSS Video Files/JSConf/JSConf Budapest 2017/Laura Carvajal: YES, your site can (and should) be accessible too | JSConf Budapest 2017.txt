Title: Laura Carvajal: YES, your site can (and should) be accessible too | JSConf Budapest 2017
Publication date: 2017-12-01
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2017
Description: 
	In 2016, we at The Financial Times launched a new version of our website to great success. It broke ground on key areas in which we’d set out to excel and measured very closely, like performance, resilience and usability. But one day, and rather serendipitously, we realized we had largely forgotten to measure one thing: accessibility. And you can’t improve what you don’t measure.

In this talk I will go over how we went from being generally oblivious about accessibility to making it a core part of our process across multiple divisions. I will share the roadblocks we found and the lessons we learned, along with tangible solutions you can integrate them into your own project today, regardless of available time, budget or support.

00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:11,010
hello everyone looking at you all here

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,570
today I'm reminded of how I felt

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,370
when I sat at the audience of an

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,000
accessibility talk myself a few years

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,770
back I remember feeling like this

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,320
accessibility thing that I didn't really

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,150
know too much about was probably this

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,740
really cool thing but I didn't really

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,939
know how it applied to me or to the

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,760
project that I was building at the time

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,289
I was building a mobile site and I kept

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,420
hearing about keyboard accessibility

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,430
it's like how does this apply to the

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,700
thing that I'm building so I felt there

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,190
was this huge gap between my product and

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,170
accessibility and looking back now that

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,390
I kind of work on this I'm kind of

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,190
embarrassed about having been there but

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,260
it's at the same time I like to fully

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,449
own having felt that way because it's

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,340
it's helped me appreciate just how easy

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,160
it is to feel that way there's no shame

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,719
in it and and yeah just the fact that

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,180
accessibility seems to be very far away

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,699
but it's not it's not really that far so

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,189
fast forward a few years I'm working at

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,020
the Financial Times we since last year

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,220
we were building the fastest greatest

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,720
new site in the industry we released it

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,590
about a year ago I was great

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,720
successfully braced replace an old

00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,610
monolithic web site and we started

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,799
winning all these words and excelling in

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,930
performance and security basically every

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,630
metric that we had set our sights on we

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,100
were sending on so one day we decided to

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,229
look at accessibility maybe we were

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,810
excelling at this to kind of like by

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,310
magic but unlike performance and

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,590
security we'd never really put a

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,689
collective effort into accessibility so

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,150
to no surprise we weren't very good and

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,950
that since this talk is going to be all

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,189
about the lessons that we learned that

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,659
was really the first the very first one

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,909
feasibility doesn't just happen you have

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,860
to make it happen

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,049
my name is Laura Carvajal I'm Smith

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,399
developer at the Financial Times this is

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,680
an actual picture of our office in

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,340
London we are a magical place and we own

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,640
a rainbow you can see that for the for

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,619
the better part of 2017 I was the lead

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,869
of the accessibility team and today I

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,760
want to tell you about so the lessons

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,500
that we learned in the ft.com team once

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,269
realize we had built this beautiful

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,849
performance thing that really couldn't

00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:20,200
be enjoyed by everyone so if today

00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:21,640
you're in that place where you're

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,159
wondering if this whole thing applies to

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,569
your project hopefully today you'll walk

00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,319
away convinced that it does and that

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:31,239
it's that it's very easy to do so what

00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,060
is accessibility there are many

00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,680
definitions out there you'll find but I

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,140
like this one very much because it

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,909
really strips it down to to its core

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,620
I'm gonna read out to you web

00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,920
accessibility means that people with

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,540
disabilities can use the web that's it

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,510
it boils it down to making sure that

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,639
we're not denying access to anyone to

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,230
the thing that we're building but I want

00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,290
to go a little bit deeper if you allow

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,849
me I want to tell you a quick story I

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,120
was in a shopping mall in London while

00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:02,680
back and we were I was with my daughter

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,319
we were going up those escalators and

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,329
and she asked me how does someone in a

00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,889
wheelchair do what we're doing and she's

00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,930
she's only ten but she's very aware of

00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:13,930
accessibility mostly because I practiced

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,129
my accessibility talks on her and she's

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,930
asked me this and I'm all proud and I

00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:18,790
say oh there's a lift and as we were

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,290
going up there we she says well where is

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,629
it we really couldn't see it from there

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,400
once we got to the top with we saw that

00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:26,949
at the very at the other end of this

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,139
very long hallway you could see you

00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:31,150
could tell there was lift and she told

00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,739
me so in a wheelchair we have to go all

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,510
the way there and up and then all the

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:37,389
way back to do what we just did in a few

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,400
seconds that's not fair and children

00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:41,230
have a way of seeing things for what

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,810
they are and even though this building

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,760
obviously it's very modern and comply

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,609
with all the standards it was it was

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,810
still a fact that it was not fair so I

00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:52,180
like to expand on the previous

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,609
definition by saying that beyond no

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,919
denying access we need to make sure that

00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,750
access that we are providing is fair to

00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:02,199
all of our users and I'm giving full

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,510
credit to my daughter for that quote so

00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,310
we've covered what accessibility is but

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,530
we mentioned the word disability so

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,900
let's look at that a little bit more we

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,419
are a disability can be split roughly

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:17,620
into these four categories physical

00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:19,989
visual hearing and cognitive and while

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,900
we may be more familiar with permanent

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,419
disabilities we also have temporary and

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,300
situational

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:30,090
so those close captions that benefit a

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,910
deaf person can also benefit anyone of

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,280
us on that spectrum and I like to say us

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,919
because each and every one of us spend

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,900
some time in our daily lives on that

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,150
spectrum so you may have other reasons

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,240
for wanting to to watch that breaking

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,400
news video without audio and so it's not

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,000
an us versus them thing and we all

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,430
benefit from accessibility but going

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,870
back to permanent disability there's

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,520
about 1 billion people in the world the

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,090
disabilities it's about 15% of the

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,550
population but once you factor in where

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,650
in the world your user base is and what

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,770
their demographics are you'll get you'll

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,990
get a clearer picture a closer number to

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:14,160
what to what that percentage is for your

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,800
user base after we did those numbers it

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,789
worked out to be 26% around 26%

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,550
potentially of our of our user base and

00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:25,889
at Ft and you know many other places we

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,410
go to great lengths to support all

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:31,289
segments of our audience so if we have

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,030
5% of people using IE 8 we kind of try

00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,919
to make sure that they have some kind of

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,950
experience so in this case we had

00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,000
potentially 26% of people who weren't

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,979
getting an experience at all so that

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,950
kind of just seeing things in numbers

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,690
tends to to motivate people to to get

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,849
started with things so let's say I've

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,200
convinced you now and you're determined

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,789
to do this are you gonna fix

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,830
accessibility on your style it's gonna

00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,470
check you know what it's like and you're

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,360
gonna be their very best at it but it

00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,010
scary and overwhelming and there's a lot

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,330
of information out there and it's kind

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,440
of hard to know where to start

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:08,250
our suggestion is just start small for

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,150
us starting small meant doing this we

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,490
installed poly

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:17,220
that's pa-11 why a 11y for accessibility

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:20,039
and tight palace and open source tool

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,990
that can check your HTML and

00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,970
automatically detect some accessibility

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,289
errors and report them back to you it

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,430
doesn't detect everything but it's a

00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:29,250
really good place to start if you have

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,320
nothing so the way it works is it goes

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,599
through your your markup and it change

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,120
it checks it against the web contact

00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:37,150
content accessibility guidelines just or

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,400
wack

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,830
it's a list of criteria that accessible

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,660
websites should meet so it checks your

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,760
markup against that and it gives you a

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,479
report that looks something like that

00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,570
that's when we ran pally manually

00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,729
against the telecom it shows two errors

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,540
so although the first time we did it had

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,740
probably 100 errors and we once we did

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,410
this for the first time we could have

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,030
gone about manually fixing all of the

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,330
error site it found and then running it

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,910
again and so on but on such a large code

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,669
base like the one we have this wasn't

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:15,160
really efficient so we went for poly CI

00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:16,690
which is basically a wrapper around poly

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,449
that you can integrate into your

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,010
continuous integration process so it

00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,900
will run automatically every time I'll

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,660
show you in a little bit how that

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,870
happens there are other tools besides

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,910
poly that do this kind of thing but we

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,340
found poly just very easy to use very

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,510
easy to integrate and they are supported

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,580
by a fabulous team of hard-working

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,370
individuals that are just always there

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,900
with any you know any questions you may

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,300
have they're just very supportive and

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,370
just continuously working to improve the

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,220
tool so our so yeah we went with that

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,440
and it's been great so I want to show

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,280
you what that looks like in our project

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,770
this is a an overlay simplified view of

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,260
our of our stack we have several node

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,450
apps that make up ft.com so you'll see

00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,169
the front page have article app signup

00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:07,960
page my 50 page those whole node apps

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:10,150
they live in and github deploy them too

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,060
we will use circle CI for containers

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,650
integration and once we push that gets

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,900
triggered and if it's the master branch

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,340
it goes live to Heroku

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,900
again overly simplified but at least for

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,349
them for what we need it

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,139
it's enough of a view pally kicks in

00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:28,599
thus the continuous integration step so

00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:31,479
for every branch that we push this check

00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:34,630
happens on the code for that branch and

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:37,750
then you get a report back to integrate

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,789
this with our with our existing build

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,690
process we only had to add one line and

00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:47,709
all that line did was called policy I in

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,020
our case since we have we generator and

00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:50,980
on the fly app for every branch we have

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,390
we just run poly

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:57,040
on that you know also generated up and

00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:59,250
and yes so we ran it for every for every

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,420
branch we ran it on that on that app and

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,580
the interesting bit here is the

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,670
threshold argument that you see here so

00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,910
that will allow pally to run and allow

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:12,520
to find up to 100 errors without

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,780
breaking your build which is ideally you

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,530
want the build to break if they're silly

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,150
even one error but since we had we

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,590
couldn't really hold production and say

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,650
I'm gonna break all the bills for all

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:25,240
the apps and ft.com can't be updated

00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,130
until we fix all these because it was a

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,680
couple hundred errors so that wasn't

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,930
viable that we no one would have let us

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,570
do that so we did was have the threshold

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,070
argument and all of our bills were still

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,020
green so all of our branches were still

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,610
passing people were still walking

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,010
working this the same way they used to

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,570
work but we were getting reports now

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,630
like the ones you see here

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:50,020
of what was broken in that branch so we

00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:52,690
spent a few weeks we'll put this inside

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,940
of all of our all of our apps and maybe

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,650
a day because that's it's literally one

00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,420
night I need to add and then we spent

00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,940
the next few weeks going through all of

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,700
the apps fixing the accessibility issues

00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:06,430
that that were found and then for every

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,580
app where we reach zero errors we remove

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:13,000
the threshold and now for any new branch

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,740
that was created off of that codebase if

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,270
it had accessibility errors then it

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,580
would break bill so once you remove the

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,460
threshold there's no errors allowed so

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:24,700
that once we did this for all of our

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:27,430
apps we got to a place where we were

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,470
confident that we were stopping any new

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,390
accessibility errors from making it into

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,860
production and I was a big deal for us

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,350
we felt like you know with which we

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,060
reached a really good place so no more

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,560
errors no more new accessibility errors

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,890
would make it into into the labs live

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,930
site but we realized that even though

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,050
people were all for ballet they were all

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,610
supportive of accessibility they knew

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,470
what it was and everyone was really

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,020
excited even about having their builds

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,100
broken people were looking forward to

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,800
their bill being broken so that they

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,780
could see what the issue was we didn't

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,970
really do a great job of explaining how

00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,220
those bills would break and more

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,990
importantly why you had to do once I

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,689
your build was broken so that was lesson

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:11,529
number two that we learned before you

00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:15,069
set the build on fire trained people so

00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:17,350
how do you go about that so we you could

00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:19,180
go about it two ways you can show them

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,649
what what they can expect

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,230
pollito fine and then what to do about

00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,970
it and then you can of course do some

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,600
training courses we'll talk about both

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:31,060
in a little bit so in terms of what Poli

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,379
can find in your project I'm gonna skip

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,089
through these fairly quickly because we

00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:36,160
don't have too much time but I'm happy

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:41,920
to chat about any of these in the break

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,649
or at any other time so one of the most

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,540
common issues that Holly found was color

00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,829
contrast issues when the text doesn't

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,620
have enough contrast with the background

00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:54,519
that's a big deal we had it everywhere

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:59,889
and another thing was alt text missing

00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:01,600
in images alt text is what the like the

00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:03,670
name says the alternative if a user

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,920
can't see the image of blind users using

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,870
a screen reader the old text is the only

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,970
thing that will tell them what the image

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,709
is and it was missing from from a lot of

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:17,170
our images that was a that was very

00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:19,920
common labels and input fields sometimes

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:23,319
they weren't related we would forget to

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,240
relate him by the ID and your UI will

00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:27,579
look the same but it will break things

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,040
completely for some assistive tech so

00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:32,170
that was very common as well required

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,149
fields that we would mark with an

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,250
asterisk and then check with JavaScript

00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:38,949
but we never heard had the word required

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,019
in some of the in some of the markup and

00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:43,110
that's a big deal too so if you feel

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:47,649
required make sure your labor required

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:49,480
ads were also a big problem I can go on

00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,740
for for a while about this but I won't

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,149
in this talk but if you have any

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,300
questions if you have ads on your site

00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,829
and you're worried about what they do to

00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,800
accessibility we can we can have a chat

00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:02,529
after but in short they're they're a big

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,959
mess also do having duplicate content on

00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,389
the site can be an issue and there ways

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,550
to mitigate that and one of the ways is

00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:11,410
adding some invisible content when you

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,029
actually have to have duplicate content

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,470
like those are too mighty buttons that

00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:17,110
just have to be there

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,420
if you add some context that's invisible

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,490
that will help people using assistive

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,310
tech anyway I'm happy to chat about any

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,590
any of these afterwards another thing

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,080
that you can do in terms of training

00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,940
your teams it's doing some accessibility

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,010
courses there's a lot of them out there

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,020
for free this is a very good one that we

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,930
did it's where we got our start it's a

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,580
free Udacity course by Alice Boxhall and

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,200
Rob Dodson from Google from the

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,790
accessibility team I'll share the slides

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,540
later so you can grab the URL but it's

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,000
really really good

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,160
you can do it at your own pace and it

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,410
will give you a good introduction and

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,700
like solid understanding of the basics

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:57,520
of accessibility so I really recommend

00:13:51,700 --> 00:14:01,290
it so we've set the tools tools like

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,970
Pali can cover about 20 to 30 percent of

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,980
accessibility errors on your site so

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,590
this is sort of the first stage of your

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,420
journey so you're kind of there and it's

00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,070
a big deal you've covered a lot and your

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,260
site is very likely a lot more

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,510
accessible than it was before but

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,790
there's a bit more to go before you get

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,290
to the summit and which means you need

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,750
to make your site fully accessible and

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,610
to do that there's some manual

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,730
intervention that that needs to happen

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:31,360
so I'm gonna go over that now so this

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,430
the the manual side of things can be in

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,800
the form of an external audit you can

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,210
have a third party check your site like

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,850
accessibility experts checking you or

00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,710
your side and your markup you can do

00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,140
some customer research ideally putting

00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,340
your site in front of users with

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,440
disabilities that can give you feedback

00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,210
and then you can learn to use this

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,100
assistive technology yourself so you can

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,420
sort of getting the shoes of some of

00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,400
these users these are not mutually

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:58,990
exclusive ideally should be doing them

00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:01,150
all so in our case the external audit

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,770
was performed by the digital

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,450
accessibility Center I'm going to show

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:12,640
you a quick video of the work that they

00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:15,490
did it's see if we have audio my name is

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,580
Rebecca Morgan I have cyber policy I

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:26,960
test with all situation and cabrona

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:29,060
method choose three click button

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,970
the controls with the videos are not

00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,500
even that big jargon

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,180
my name is James okay and I'm the color

00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,890
contrast and readability analyst at the

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,230
digital accessibility Center and today

00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:42,440
on the homepage I encountered some text

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,060
displayed on top of images text

00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,279
displayed on top of images can be quite

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,870
difficult to read because of the varying

00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,700
color contrast of the image behind the

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,620
text and we see add I'm a website

00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,230
analyst at the DAC

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,990
I test using zoomtext with audible

00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,520
feedback as the assistive technology i'm

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:10,070
gonna scroll on down hello

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:12,680
and just demonstrate so there's an empty

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:18,440
space here which would be an ideal place

00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:21,290
ft to put the subheading name is

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,209
jonathan brew I'm a cognitive analyst at

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,940
the digital accessibility Center there

00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:29,120
is a moving image that distracts me from

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,850
all the content another issue I've found

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,400
on the homepage is the carousel when

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:38,380
navigating through it I couldn't find

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:41,690
the arrow to to navigate to each page

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:46,029
and once I found that eventually finding

00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,029
the other previous button was difficult

00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,310
hello there my name is Mike Jones I'm

00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,960
completely blind and I'm a screen reader

00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:01,480
analyst for the digital accessibility

00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:04,360
Center on one of the articles I tested

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,500
there are several headings that

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:11,540
announces read more and these also

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,870
interrupt the articling it's not clear

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,579
what the user will be reading more about

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,290
verb etre this these headings actually

00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,449
interrupt the main article that the user

00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:23,720
is reading so it would have been helpful

00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:25,820
to me to ensure that the article read

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:31,190
smoothly and continuously without

00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:33,890
interruptions so this is only a two

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,120
minute video but we we actually were

00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:38,480
lucky enough to be able to spend the day

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,430
a full day with a with the analysts and

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,870
it was I highly recommend it if you have

00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,300
the chance because it will really change

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:48,500
your perspective forever of how people

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:51,890
use the product that you're building so

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:54,260
that audit that was performed on our

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:57,080
site produced a 200 page report with all

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,430
the errors that they found and we

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,200
wouldn't spend maybe a couple months

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,890
fixing those it was a lot of errors and

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,230
in the end we got an official

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,630
accreditation that said st tacoma is

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,130
accessible to such-and-such level and we

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,280
were very very glad to get it obviously

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,930
i was months of hard work but it's it's

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,780
a title we don't really want to hold

00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,400
alone so if there anyone is anyone here

00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,740
from you know other news publications or

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,030
really anyone this is really one metric

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,430
we should all be trying to outdo each

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,140
other on kind the same way we tried to

00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,700
outdo each other on performance we want

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,840
to be faster than the competition but we

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,190
want to be more accessible than the

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,790
competition we should be we should be

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:38,150
and compete on this we all win if we're

00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:41,690
all more accessible so the second thing

00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:44,090
is to do customer research get your

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,500
product in front of actual users because

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,570
you may have all the theory right you

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,700
may have your accreditation in place but

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,340
you want your new features to be to be

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,750
tested by actual users or you might end

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,180
up building something that looks good on

00:18:53,750 --> 00:19:00,080
paper but still get it very very wrong

00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:02,720
and lastly you can learn to use assist

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,700
assistive tech yourself this this you

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,260
can do for free

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,510
and I highly encourage it because it's

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,630
also a lot of fun these are some of the

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,700
tools that we use on our setup we use

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:18,130
Mac's at the FT so we use voiceover

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:19,600
voiceover keyboard only and we zoom if

00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:23,110
you're on a Mac you can get these for

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,600
free one thing that really helped was

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,070
going keyboard only so initially what we

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,840
did was when we were about to test the

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,639
side we would just not use the trackpad

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,649
and not use the mouse and test it with a

00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:37,809
keyboard but it really helps to find the

00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:40,960
more nuanced issues if you go keyboard

00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:43,000
only all the time so we did that just to

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,309
experiment but then we can stay doing

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,299
that you know those who have volunteered

00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,570
to do this

00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:51,850
this was my set up back in November last

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:55,539
year when I started doing this so it I

00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,980
do recommend printing out the shortcuts

00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,559
for the apps that you most used before

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,120
you kind of unplug your mouse and and

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:03,250
turn off your trackpad can be really

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,700
helpful so this was mean I said it back

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,200
then but as you use this you memorize

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,570
the shortcuts even if you don't want to

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,639
so I think I'm about almost of that

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,529
papers gone I think about how about 10

00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:16,559
left that I haven't managed to learn

00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:18,760
because I don't use them very often but

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,070
but yeah it's really really helpful to

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,950
just really really not use the mouse and

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,779
the trackpad I just did that by having

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,360
an external keyboard with like a numeric

00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:29,590
keypad but one if I'm stalking my laptop

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,440
and I don't have the external keyboard

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,059
and my track that's gonna be active I

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,070
try to make it as uncomfortable as

00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:38,769
possible to use so I remove all the

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:42,250
goodies that that app will give us make

00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:43,690
it very slow so that if I you know start

00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,669
going back to using the trackpad a lot

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,519
I'll notice it's uncomfortable and

00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:50,260
remember to go back to the keyboard so

00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,179
if I if you have the chance to do it I

00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,610
highly recommend it I'd also make you

00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:56,529
faster you become this power user and

00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:59,200
you learn to you learn very quickly

00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:59,980
which sites are accessible and which

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,809
signs aren't

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,760
you'll find in github you can navigate

00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:06,039
around without a mouse very quickly I

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,809
feed on already and you'll find you can

00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,470
do this in other sites that maybe you

00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,659
didn't do before

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,799
so that's lesson number three that we

00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:13,799
learn throw away your mouse

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,879
okay so going back to this list of

00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:22,460
things that you still have to fix it's

00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:24,440
it's you've learned to use all the tools

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,029
your setup with your keyboard it's very

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,820
tempting to just roll up your sleeves

00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:30,759
and try to fix everything yourself but

00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,769
if we can give you one piece of advice

00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:34,909
don't don't do this one thing that I

00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:37,009
learned I want to say I learned pretty

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:39,320
quickly but it took me a while to learn

00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:41,029
it was that trying to fix all these

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,710
things especially on a large site like a

00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:45,139
cheetah come it's not really the right

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:49,039
answer you will most definitely burn out

00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:50,299
very quickly it's inefficient bugs

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,919
New York's ability bugs will happen

00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:53,779
faster then you can clean them up and

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,059
you really are doing a disservice to

00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,320
your team by becoming the bottleneck the

00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:00,619
person that fixes everything

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,720
so most people really want to help and

00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:05,869
want to you know get this right if they

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,029
just know how to do that so spend some

00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:10,389
of your effort not just in fixing the

00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:12,950
bugs but in in raising awareness

00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:16,460
awareness and training your people on

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,049
accessibility yeah instead of just

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,960
trying to fix everything yourself and

00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:23,389
also if you have a say in your

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,940
recruitment process make it a part of it

00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:28,220
so this is this was our old requirements

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:31,419
based job description last year but we

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,499
added it in there and now it's sort of

00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:35,720
you can add it in there at the bottom

00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:39,350
just sneak it into the desired skills

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,850
and it can work its way up and also if

00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,649
you have an online test or some kind of

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,119
coding test at some point make sure you

00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:46,490
include an accessibility question in

00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:47,690
there and I apologize for redacting some

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,279
of these because we're actively hiring

00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,019
and I don't want to give too much away

00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:54,049
but the idea is that you know you have a

00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:55,100
some markup and you asked how would you

00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,980
make this more accessible so you can

00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,749
engage you know if people have had

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,029
exposure to accessibility or at least if

00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:04,009
there's interest because if you spend

00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,240
time training your team ideally you want

00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:07,850
to if you want to bring more people in

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,110
into your team ideally they will have

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,389
some knowledge of accessibility or if

00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,519
not at least think that it's something

00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:15,590
that's important to to build into a

00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,289
project anyway so if you have a saying

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:21,230
in your in your hiring process just

00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:22,940
sneak it in there so yeah lesson number

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,759
four that we learned kind of the hard

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,930
way don't take this all on yourself the

00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,000
bulk of the work really

00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,700
taken care of if everyone's a part of it

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,220
so and even beyond developers designers

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,020
developers QA product we all have a role

00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:40,190
to play in making our product accessible

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,660
another good way to spread the word is

00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,610
making an event out of it if you have a

00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,160
chance

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:48,650
back in November last year we put

00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,240
together a roadshow in like an open

00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:53,750
space that we have at the office we

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,000
invited everyone to fill out a look at

00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,440
perform using a screen reader it's kind

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,580
of the software that if you're blind

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,800
you're likely to use to navigate

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,890
websites it will read out the screen to

00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,750
you and we offered a free 20 pound

00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,580
Amazon gift card and turns out people

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,580
like free stuff so they showed up so we

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,650
had a big crowd and this is the form

00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,560
that they had to complete and as you can

00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:18,140
see or cannot see you can't see very

00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,970
much you were forced to rely on the

00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,700
screen reader to tell you what's on the

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,710
screen so and a lot of people who

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,850
stopped by had never used a screen

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,920
reader before didn't know what it was

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,530
and some of them didn't even know about

00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,720
the concept of accessibility so this was

00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:36,610
a good way to getting a lot of people

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,260
exposed to to all this this is a forum

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,940
it's a very simple form that was built

00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,360
to be accessible so you could fill it

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,910
out using a screen reader and it was we

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:50,210
did this for a couple hours in this open

00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,950
area and the big takeaway from this this

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,260
experiment it's one of the highlights of

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,720
my career in the 15 years so that I've

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,390
been doing software engineering it's

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,650
moments like this one that's if you know

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,840
him that's Patrick Hammond he's a

00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:05,240
seasoned developer who's really you know

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,630
surprised by by web stuff but this was

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,850
his reaction to using a screen reader to

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:15,500
use the thing that he built for a living

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:18,020
so and we got that kind of reaction from

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,840
a lot of people so it's we managed to

00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,280
create this space of collective empathy

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,620
where we had a couple dozen people's

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,330
sort of step into someone else's shoes

00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,960
for a little bit and they were all

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:31,700
walked away with the knowledge that

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,110
they're the product that they build it's

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,730
not only used in the way that they use

00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,920
it a lot of people use it in many

00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,400
different ways so it's it was very

00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,330
powerful in sending message

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,040
and very effective and raising awareness

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,150
so I was lesson number five talked about

00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,820
it a lot

00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,770
spread the word make it your thing you

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,420
never know who's listening and you're

00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:53,220
probably reaching more people than you

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:56,990
think by just talking about it in the

00:25:53,220 --> 00:26:00,270
office or at meetups or events like this

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,340
so we've said that you know these are

00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:05,010
some ways to help make your site more

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,960
accessible but obviously these two at

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,430
the top cost money so it doesn't mean

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,110
that you can't make your product

00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:13,440
accessible if you don't have the budget

00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:15,420
for it but if you can it's it helps you

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,670
reach that that some it helps you reach

00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,920
higher so there may be times when you

00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,929
need to raise cash internally or

00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,790
externally to fund your accessibility

00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:24,960
efforts if you need to dedicate one or

00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,640
two people or some of your time to

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,429
accessibility you may need to raise some

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,160
money and we needed to do this at the FT

00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:34,470
to fund to fund our team and me being

00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,030
new to this and kind of naive say okay

00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,520
well accessibility is can it's the right

00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,760
thing to do it's you know give me give

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,290
me some cash and we learned this one we

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,640
learned very quickly it's the right

00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,980
thing to do doesn't really get you a

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,670
budget so you need to kind of make a

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,710
case for it and Alex Bartlett who works

00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,780
with us at the origami team put this

00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,940
together a while ago she's done a lot of

00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,350
research on sort of the business case

00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,710
for accessibility how do you sell it to

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:04,440
the business and she found that avoiding

00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,300
litigation avoiding being sued is one of

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,429
the most evidence business cases for

00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,040
accessibility so if you're a big enough

00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:13,290
company you risk getting sued and the

00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,320
cost when getting sued if your site is

00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:18,300
not accessible and the cost of that

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,510
lawsuit and the sort of the the brand

00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,640
damage is a lot higher than what you

00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:26,400
could invest in a small team to you know

00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,110
fix stuff and get things up to speed so

00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,309
there's a link to I'll share these

00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,770
slides later so you can grab that link

00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:33,480
it's a very good presentation and yeah

00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:35,790
you have a lot of information if you

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,960
need to make this case yourself in your

00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:41,790
company so before we finish I want to

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,780
take you back to how this all started

00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:47,700
for us at the FT I was in bug Duty one

00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,160
day and I saw this card in JIRA that

00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,930
said integrate poly I didn't know what

00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,360
poly was had no idea it was my

00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,950
turn about dude I just grabbed it and I

00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,530
got a little bit curious and I looked

00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,910
through the history of the cart and I

00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:03,320
saw that he had been bouncing around our

00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:07,020
board for months and it was only until

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,520
my colleague Ben Fletcher who was a

00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,040
senior developer at the time and who

00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,780
happens to be deaf blind he prioritized

00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,130
it and he just made us all whether this

00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,280
is something that maybe we should be

00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:19,770
working on and this is the last lesson

00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,570
that I want to leave you with diversity

00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,750
will improve your product will improve

00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,090
your team and will improve your life

00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:29,700
this Ben's small action on that JIRA

00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:32,550
boards snowballed into us building a

00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,980
better product the team learning about

00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,980
accessibility and that to me standing in

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,680
front of you're here today

00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:42,480
so to recap and to give you things that

00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,180
you could do tonight in under half an

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,980
hour accessibility doesn't just happen

00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,990
you have to do something about it one

00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,580
good way to start is integrate piling

00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,830
into your process give it a high

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,900
threshold just let it run and start

00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:58,080
getting reports of what's broken with

00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,730
what you're building if anything train

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,830
your people so you can something you can

00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,420
do very quickly share that link to that

00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,100
Udacity course and may people do it on

00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,900
their own time so there's some awareness

00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,570
of what accessibility is and why it

00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,340
matters throw away your mouse you can do

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,280
that very quickly but ideally print out

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,060
shortcuts beforehand don't take it all

00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,130
on yourself

00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,410
share share the load the more people

00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,640
around you who know about it the easier

00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,770
it will be and the more efficient you'll

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,730
be talk about it

00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:30,000
Twitter put up together Roadshow if you

00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:32,850
can in terms of budget if you have to

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,130
raise one I remember the the biggest

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,180
motivator is avoiding getting sued and

00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,340
getting sued is expensive and

00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,570
embarrassing and we don't want that it's

00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,360
probably cheaper to just invest in

00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,490
accessibility and diversity matters and

00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,170
I wish I had something I could give you

00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,120
that you could do in a couple minutes

00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:51,990
tonight but for this one I don't but if

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,450
you have a say in hiring or in any of

00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:57,810
these areas and where you work try and

00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:59,190
prioritize in the the most more diverse

00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:00,570
that you have in your team the better

00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:04,770
the thing that you build on the burial

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:05,530
life will be lastly a while back having

00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,680
this PD

00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:09,760
only entrance to a public building

00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,060
wasn't a norm there was nothing wrong

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,620
with it

00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,360
but now would be unthinkable right to

00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,880
have you know only stairs be the only

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,860
way you can get into a public building

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,600
so we're a little bit behind on software

00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:23,170
so don't wait until it becomes

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,510
unthinkable for to build inaccessible

00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,190
websites the the time to make to start

00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:31,260
making your website accessible is really

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:36,099
now so just do it thank you very much

00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:36,099
