Title: Patricia Realini - Is A Hot Dog A Sandwich And Other Analogies Not To Trifle With
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: JSConf Australia 2018
Description: 
	Metaphors are an essential means of communication and method of teaching for developers. Without them and Lin Clark, it would be much more difficult for teams to adopt Redux. But learning by association has its limits. When we only discuss the things we can relate to we reinforce existing stereotypes that box us in. Instead of thinking outside the box, we will discuss how thinking about the box itself is the key to breaking down our unconscious bias. Together we will learn how to dismantle the concepts that divide us, techniques for better engaging with people of all backgrounds, and how to empower the systems we work in to be even more performant than our code.

I kind of want everybody to like loosen

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,150
up so if everybody wants to get up we're

00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:20,990
gonna do a little dance

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:24,520
come on you go like starving it's gonna

00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,520
be you let's celebrate

00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,700
I kinda want to just give a big round of

00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:36,760
applause to the organizers for doing an

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,470
incredible job where you to like lift me

00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,050
or something can we give a big round of

00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:46,070
applause to the organizers

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,070
[Applause]

00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:59,360
oh my god good turn oh okay thank you so

00:00:51,260 --> 00:01:02,090
much for dancing I'm so honored to get

00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,030
to close out those last year's coughing

00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,560
it's so bittersweet that this is the

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,880
last time that this is all going to be

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,420
put together but I'm sure that we'll all

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,940
get together again soon my name is

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,070
Patricia and I've had many many past

00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:21,200
lives but for now I'm a front-end

00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:23,600
developer and when I began teaching

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,240
myself JavaScript and when I got

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,760
involved in the JavaScript community I

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,350
finally joined our beloved trash fire

00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:35,180
that is Twitter and the thing that I

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,100
noticed that was the most peculiar to me

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,830
was that there was this perennial debate

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:44,300
that kept happening about whether or not

00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:47,960
a hot dog was a sandwich and at first I

00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:50,090
was like is this just like in my

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,860
microcosm of friends is this just

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,060
something that I happen to be seeing

00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:58,310
because of like confirmation bias or is

00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,200
like and I was like no no because

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,360
Silicon Valley just recently did a joke

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,210
about it on their show they made an app

00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,159
called not hot dog where you could take

00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,050
a picture of something and it would tell

00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,140
you if it was a hot dog or if it was not

00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,700
a hot dog and so in the show they take a

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,470
bunch of pictures of sandwiches and

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,580
they're like oh not a hot dog but then

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,090
they take a picture of up talking

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,760
they're like yep that's a hot dog so I

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:25,459
started asking my friends what was going

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,880
on why was this debate happening why was

00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:30,769
this such a hot topic and that they told

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,250
me that the reason why it was because of

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:36,049
ontology and I was like like metaphysics

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,049
like is this some kind of matrix meme

00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:41,690
that I'm not in on like what I don't for

00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:45,410
me ontology is like the study of the

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,790
nature of being and reality so I was

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,209
very confused they were like no no no no

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:52,820
no this is ontology which is in

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,170
information science which is the formal

00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,120
naming and definition of types

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,670
properties and interrelationships of

00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,700
entities in a domain of discourse so

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,940
basically it's just

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:07,920
fancy way of saying categorizing

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:09,959
and so we use ontology and computer

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,750
science to limit complexity and organize

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,959
information but for me it was so forced

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,590
for me I saw hot dog and like I was it

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,360
made my blood boil to hear this argument

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,590
over and over and over again because I

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,230
felt like they were trying to stick a

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,239
round peg through a square hole and I

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,970
was like you guys they're not or

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,379
everybody they're not hot dogs like hot

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:36,180
dogs are not sandwiches hot dogs are

00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:37,470
most like tacos like why can't you stop

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,860
talk like why are you still talking

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,989
about sandwiches because it really

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,269
bothered me because what it demonstrated

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,920
to me was the way that all of our

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:51,810
unconscious bias is used and manipulates

00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,230
even our own minds when we don't realize

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:58,230
it to reinforce existing stereotypes and

00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,870
reinforce existing unconscious bias and

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,610
existing systems of oppression like the

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,739
sandwich was invented by Earl of

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:10,950
Sandwich in the 1750s he put a PC asses

00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:12,630
his servant hate sees like those anyways

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,239
he asked his servant to give him his

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,549
meals between two pieces of bread and

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,829
what happened was he would order that

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,389
from the gambling table and his friends

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,700
were like I'll have what sandwiches

00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,260
having like I just read that in

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,880
quotations and I would really like to

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,789
know if that was what actually happened

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,260
or not but because then the When Harry

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:39,660
Met Sally scene has a whole different

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:41,639
meaning but so basically like I with the

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:46,020
help of my friend Justin we like made

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:48,570
this meme to stop this debate because we

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,539
were just so tired of hearing it

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,160
and Justin filled me in on this really

00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:54,660
great book which is called surface in

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,970
essence by Douglas Hofstadter and

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,800
Emmanuel Sanders and it's all about how

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,539
analogies are the fuel and fire of

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,880
thinking and category they say

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:04,710
categorization is the pulsing pulsating

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,139
heartbeat of thought allowing us to

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,509
exploit the rich storehouse of wisdom

00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,699
in our past and categorization gives us

00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:14,129
the feeling of understanding a situation

00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,120
you're in by providing a clear

00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:17,159
perspective on it

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,860
allowing hidden items and qualities to

00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:21,840
be detected future events to be

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,580
anticipated and the consequences of

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,349
actions to be foreseen so by considering

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,319
how we think we can get to the root of

00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:33,080
unconscious bias which is stereotypes we

00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,669
have to look at these broad

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,779
generalizations that we use and are

00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:42,090
reinforcing unconscious bias and systems

00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:45,599
of oppression through analogies and

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,550
metaphors that we use every day to be

00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,430
more inclusive we have to consider how

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,529
these analogies are manipulating us and

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,300
these are the three most common ways

00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:58,259
that analogies can be used to manipulate

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,919
first they can be invisible so anything

00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:04,319
like like just seeing the word like any

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,469
language that you use has an invisible

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,199
analogies in it a dictionary is nothing

00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:13,020
but invisible analogies like how can you

00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,569
define a word without other words you

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,819
need analogies to do that also the

00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:19,050
second most common ways that analogies

00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,020
manipulate us is that they are

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,000
inaccurate or that they lack nuance and

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,860
the last way is propaganda and the

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,259
reason why I divided it into these three

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,620
groups is because the first one involves

00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,330
no intent there is no intent on the side

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,689
of the person who is using the analogy

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:39,899
or the metaphor to manipulate the intent

00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:42,539
is not there and therefore it should it

00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:45,810
would be invisible because it can't be

00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:48,089
detected the second example inaccurate

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,699
or lacking nuance is an example of when

00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:53,219
an analogy or metaphor is manipulating

00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,020
us because of a negligence so like with

00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:56,580
the hot dog and sandwich debate there is

00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,770
a negligence on the part of the people

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,800
who were arguing that hot dogs were like

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:04,830
sandwiches to really consider whether or

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,529
not those categories were being fed to

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,270
them by all of their past knowledge or

00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:11,099
whether they were actually going out of

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,099
their way to figure out what was the

00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:16,259
best way to categorize a hot dog and the

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:18,860
last way is obviously propaganda

00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,289
obviously has it intent its

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,930
these analogies are meant to manipulate

00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:26,289
us and execute the agenda of the author

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,759
so we're mostly going to be focusing on

00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:33,800
inaccuracy lack of nuance and

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:35,419
invisibility and because metaphors are

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,310
dangerous metaphors are not to be

00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:39,259
trifled with a single metaphor can give

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,270
birth to love this is one of my favorite

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:44,750
quotations from The Unbearable Lightness

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,610
of being by Milan Kundera we need two

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,650
metaphors are the stuff of life and we

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,750
need to be careful and question then in

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,370
order to bridge the gap between us and

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,259
the others the others that we don't

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:58,099
understand that we don't know how to

00:07:54,259 --> 00:08:00,710
connect with Claude Steele is the author

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,810
of a book called whistling Vivaldi he's

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,759
a social psychologist and researcher at

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,379
Columbia University and he wrote this

00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,590
book whistling Vivaldi about his

00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:12,229
research into stereotypes and how they

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,150
manipulate us and how we can break them

00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:16,789
down and whether or not they actually

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,789
have an effect on us and after many many

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:22,340
experiments that were redone by many

00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:26,690
many other social psychologists behind

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:28,969
him he used a kind of language that I

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,099
really appreciated because I felt like

00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:32,899
it got to the crux of the issue and the

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:35,269
reason why we have so much difficulty

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:38,240
bridging this gap and tearing down our

00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:40,459
unconscious bias and that's that he

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,229
inverted the conversation for me so

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:44,000
instead of talking about privilege and

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,600
instead of talking about all of the ways

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,730
that we benefit which like privilege is

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,829
not bad privilege is not inherently bad

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,110
when we talk about privilege we're

00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,880
talking about the things that you that

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,949
you get that make your life easier we're

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,140
not talking about how you're costing

00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:03,199
someone else something it however that

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,910
does enter into the equation and that is

00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:06,829
why I think that there's so much

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,720
difficulty understanding these concepts

00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:10,339
and so I'd like you to take a moment and

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,899
invert these concepts in your thought

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,449
and instead of thinking about privilege

00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:16,579
when you think about the inequalities in

00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:18,110
the world think about stereotype threat

00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:20,329
which is what underrepresented

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,880
minorities experience it's a combination

00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:24,980
of stigma pressure and identity

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,910
contingencies identity contingencies

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,459
exist for everyone when a white sis mail

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,660
signs up for a class on african-american

00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:35,000
history

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,949
he has an identity contingency that is

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,440
going to create stigma pressure and

00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:43,240
therefore will have a stereotype threat

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,790
in that class so by inverting this I

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:50,660
sorry excuse me I lost my voice on the

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:54,139
plane so by inverting this and

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:56,269
considering stereotype threat we can see

00:09:54,139 --> 00:10:10,180
the conversation from the other point of

00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:12,439
view so instead of subjugating us to

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,730
instead of talking about the things that

00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:15,290
you have to deal with when you're in a

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,779
situation because you have a given

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,110
social identity we should consider the

00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:22,970
circumstances you have to deal with

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,370
because as it underrepresented minority

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,819
I'm always aware of what other people

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:35,149
could think I'm always living in two

00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:41,540
different worlds and we should put the

00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:43,370
dancing in here at this time it's really

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,930
hard to talk for 35 minutes straight

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:51,829
when you're losing your voice take a

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:55,339
loss in real quick steel talks about in

00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:58,689
whistling Vivaldi oh my god am I ever

00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:58,689
gonna be able to finish this sentence

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,860
um the work of Edward Jones and Richard

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:07,360
Nesbitt and how they exploit explain how

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,540
these different things manifest in the

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,060
world and they explained it by talking

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:17,320
about observers perspective and actors

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:19,000
perspective which is that so they talk

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,699
about observers perspective and actors

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,120
perspective and how observers emphasize

00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:27,430
what they can see and they D emphasize

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,690
things that they can't see they D

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:35,860
emphasise how the systems of oppression

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:38,800
that are not obvious to them and as an

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,199
underrepresented minority and the actors

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,149
perspective these are things that were

00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:45,070
hyper aware of these are things that

00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:47,649
influence every single decision that we

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,139
make for example people talk a lot about

00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:52,389
male chivalry but there's also female

00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:54,880
chivalry which is this concept of like

00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:57,760
women being performative doing our hair

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,320
being subversive you know putting on

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,870
nice outfits like that is female

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,480
chivalry that is the actors perspective

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:09,040
side of the equation that people don't

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,899
see and when we can't see inequalities

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,209
they manifest more quickly and they

00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:15,670
manifest the social socio-economic

00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:17,949
disadvantage segregated social practices

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:24,100
and research of cultural orientations

00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:26,860
the other side of actors perspective is

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,930
very perfectly described here by W EB

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,360
Dubois in the soul of black folk which

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,010
was published in 1903 and I highly

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,389
recommend that everyone take a minute to

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,769
read it but basically WB Dubois created

00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,630
this concept of double consciousness

00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:44,949
which is that as an underrepresented

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:47,139
minority you're always aware of the

00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:48,639
multiple worlds that you exist in you

00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:51,010
exist in your own world of your own

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,350
identities and that can be multifaceted

00:12:51,010 --> 00:13:01,620
depending on your sexual orientation

00:12:53,350 --> 00:13:04,180
your gender if you are ill or not and

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,769
this causes cognitive dissonance it

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:11,079
makes it more difficult to operate in

00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:11,680
the world so and this leads me to like

00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:12,880
something else

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,440
that is really important to me this is

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,360
something that happens on teams very

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,880
often which is Ringelmann effect which

00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,180
is where as the group grows individual

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,540
productivity drops and the reason why

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:28,270
this this affects URM is the most is

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:32,140
because privilege works as social

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,490
capital and it allows people to do what

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,980
is called social loafing

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,440
so you see here TJ Miller is just

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,270
enjoying a head off of a bong while

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,190
everybody else is working around him

00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,140
right that's social loafing and what

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,500
happens is underrepresented minorities

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,060
pick up the slack so to reduce this from

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,830
happening to keep this from happening

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,690
you have to limit your scope of your

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,160
projects you have to keep your groups

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,589
small you have to divvy up

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,870
responsibilities equitably and you have

00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:02,279
to reward coordination and cooperation

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:05,170
and because people like getting credit

00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,360
you're gonna have a happier team a more

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:14,790
psychologically safe team at a better

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:17,560
community is my lipstick okay so

00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,970
Ringelmann effect is one thing that can

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,100
happen another thing that can happen is

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,500
called bystander effect bystander effect

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,290
was researched by John Darley and

00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:30,010
bible-- atany in 1968 after the death of

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:33,339
kitty Genovese a in 1964 at 3:00 a.m.

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,170
she was attacked over the course of an

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,180
entire the entire rest of the evening

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,980
and morning and the New York Times

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,630
published that 37 people witnessed her

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,630
attack but in reality it was more like

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,850
about a dozen people but imagine that

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:49,000
you are out in the middle of the street

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,880
and someone attacks you and 12 people

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,290
walk past and don't do anything about it

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,900
and so this really inspired these two

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,120
social researchers to look into why this

00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,770
was happening they did a number of

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,860
different experiments one of my

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:08,890
favorites was the smoke room experiment

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,450
where they put a person in a room with a

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,520
questionnaire and then they released

00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,870
smoke into the room and they tested to

00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,520
see how long it took before they

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,740
reported that there was smoke coming

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,390
into the room and as the group increased

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,070
as more people were in the room filling

00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,470
out the survey the length of time that

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,480
it took to report what was happening

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,620
what up dramatically

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,620
and that's because of diffusion of

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,269
responsibility so what they noted was

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,329
they with bystander of fact what happens

00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:36,550
is you notice interpret assess degree of

00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:38,500
responsibility form assistance and

00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:40,570
implement an action choice and that

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,360
action choice can be direct intervention

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,910
detour intervention or no intervention

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,730
and biased prevents people from directly

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,250
helping those that need help from

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,620
directly to helping people that

00:15:50,250 --> 00:16:00,420
absolutely could be advantaged by the

00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:03,430
privilege that you can offer so they

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,440
Darley and let found that responsibility

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,820
depends on whether or not we feel that

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,490
the person who needs help

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:13,329
deserves it our competence and our

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:16,209
relationship to them and detour response

00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:18,699
detour intervention doesn't work in

00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,920
situations of bias because the systems

00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:25,089
of oppression that already exist don't

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:27,820
allow for help so how do we do effective

00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:29,709
direct intervention how do we help the

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,529
people who need to be helped in the

00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:35,079
1970s in New York crime was really high

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,000
in the subways it was practically unsafe

00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,800
to go on the subway but this

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,779
organization called the guardian angels

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,610
came together and it was their

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:45,130
membership was mostly young men black

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,110
and Latino who had a skewed gang life in

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:56,290
their own neighborhoods to better their

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:58,660
city they had this system that I loved

00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:01,120
it was fantastic what they did was they

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,800
put one person on each subway car and if

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,140
a fight broke out or if someone got

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,150
attacked on a subway car they would know

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,890
because at every subway stop they all

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,809
poked their heads out the subway door

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,490
and check to make sure that everyone was

00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:14,140
visible and if someone wasn't visible

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,730
they would know that the person in that

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,179
subway car needed assistance and they

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,980
would all run to that subway car to help

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,809
they did this despite the fact that the

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,020
police was we're calling them vigilantes

00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:28,809
despite the fact that they were at first

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,880
shunned by many and over time because

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:33,580
they helped so many people the attitude

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,799
of the public turned around in a few

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:39,220
years the public was able to go on the

00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,990
subway safely they were able to enjoy

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,850
they're City again and it is because of

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:46,480
the guardian angels that the subway got

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:48,850
cleaned up in the 80s another example of

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,409
direct intervention that worked despite

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,610
a system of oppression not helping is

00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:56,620
something that was described on reply

00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,570
all's writing on the wall episode at

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,000
Colgate University in upstate New York

00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,760
the Black Student Union leaders were

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,700
getting direct death threats through the

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,799
anonymous messaging app Yik yak and the

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,750
administration of the school refused to

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,169
do anything about it they refused to

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:16,179
contact yak and ask them about the

00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:18,730
people who were posting these death

00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:20,980
threats they refused to do any

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,620
punishment when they found out who these

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,770
people were and so what happened was

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,929
assistant professor of biology Jeff

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,150
Holmes started this campaign that he

00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:33,460
called the Yik yak take-back and it was

00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:38,409
a social media campaign akin to sending

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:40,990
Ned Flanders to comment on 4chan the

00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:44,470
rules were that professors needed to go

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:47,020
on and all they had to do was sign their

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,270
name but what they and he encouraged

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,000
them to post messages of well-wishes

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,100
messages about joking about how hard the

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,840
midterm was gonna be broadcasting

00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,970
congratulations to students on their

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,659
final fun finishing their thesis and

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:04,390
what he did was by witnessing by using

00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:06,820
his privilege he witnessed these death

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:10,299
threats and it created this environment

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,429
where it was no longer a place where it

00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:14,559
was acceptable to post these kinds of

00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:23,080
messages because the professor's got

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:25,150
involved and they directly intervened we

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,900
have to get directly involved to make

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:31,000
change and we have to recognize when an

00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,280
underrepresented minority points out bad

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,610
behavior we are challenging you to be

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,710
better if we felt that your intent was

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,059
malicious or bad in any way shape or

00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,770
form I promise you

00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:43,630
underrepresented minorities are going to

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,730
disengage they're going to block you on

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,070
social media they're not going to risk

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:50,740
their own safety to tell you that they

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,390
think that you were wrong when we feel

00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,770
that we're in danger we

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:58,690
you know to tendin to be friend we know

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,700
to go to our groups because the group is

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,430
more likely to survive harassment than

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,470
an individual but when we see bad

00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,330
behavior and we trust that the person

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,390
has good intentions we're going to call

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:14,830
it out and when it gets called out it's

00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:16,810
best if you listen internalize apologize

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:20,260
be accountable for your actions and be

00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:22,030
attentive to the ways that that was part

00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,160
of your unconscious bias so that you can

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,450
take it out of your unconscious bias so

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,170
that you can be conscious of those

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:31,060
moments because we care too much to stop

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:34,030
demanding more this is a matter of our

00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,500
safety this isn't a matter of our what

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,200
we'd like to do and what we don't like

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,550
to do I don't like having to confront my

00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,920
friends when they say something

00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:45,270
inappropriate I don't like having to

00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,590
confront people on Twitter about a

00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,550
comment or a word that was used that was

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,730
a ballista

00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:55,780
it's what we need to do in order to make

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:57,520
a better society each choice is an

00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,890
opportunity to influence the world that

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,880
we exist in Sartre when he wrote on

00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,610
Being and Nothingness

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,710
wrote notes about creating an ethical

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,660
model to pair with his existential

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:10,870
philosophy but he never got beyond notes

00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,850
Simone de Beauvoir did she wrote ethics

00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,730
of ambiguity which perfectly

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,980
encapsulates its I looked for years for

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,650
an ethical model that I felt matched

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,970
what I was internally feeling because I

00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,130
know that there's nothing new Under the

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,680
Sun and someone must have written it and

00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,630
what's fascinating to me is that her

00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,480
book isn't even mentioned on Wikipedia's

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,640
page for existentialism it's a direct

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,320
response to on being in nothingness it's

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,440
not mentioned in most philosophy

00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,680
curriculums but she wrote about how

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,300
because we have freedom Eden and because

00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,040
of existentialism because of the fact

00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,870
that likes Archer killed God and

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:52,930
basically said that it's our choices are

00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,940
our own it means that we have our own

00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:58,080
responsibility to make our own choices

00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:01,240
in each and every moment in order to

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,950
help not just ourselves but the society

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,500
that we choose to participate in

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,310
participating in society social contract

00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,710
is a choice

00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:13,120
and therefore because social contract is

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:19,420
a choice it is imperative that a moral

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:22,380
attitude be adopted as well so after

00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:24,820
discussing all of this high-end like

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,640
social theory let's look at another

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,560
example or unconscious bias exist so

00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,850
here's an analogy that's so pervasive

00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,800
that we usually wouldn't think blink

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,620
tight twice but you might not have known

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,470
this but actually before the compass was

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:41,770
invented East used to be at the top of

00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:44,410
the map because the Sun would rise in

00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:46,570
the east and so maps were oriented with

00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,690
East at the top but when you see this

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:52,510
analogy that west to east is equal to

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:55,200
left-to-right your mind doesn't think

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:57,700
about it it's an invisible analogy and

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,610
how does like how does this apply to us

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,050
as developers why man honestly the West

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:06,250
Wing does a much better job of

00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:08,260
explaining this than I do so partly to

00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,180
aggressively support legislation that

00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,770
would make it mandatory for every public

00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,980
school in America to teach geography

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,870
using the Peters projection map instead

00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,550
of the traditional Mercator give me 200

00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:22,420
bucks and it's done really

00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:24,400
No why are we changing maps because CJ

00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,530
the Mercator projection has fostered

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,150
European imperialist attitudes for

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,090
centuries and created an ethnic bias

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,130
against a third world really the german

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,950
cartographer Mercator originally

00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,260
designed this map in 1569 as a

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,780
navigational tool for European sailors

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,340
the map enlarges areas at the poles to

00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,530
create straight lines of constant

00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,450
bearing or geographic direction so it

00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,180
makes it easier to cross an ocean but

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:51,820
yes it distorts the relative size of

00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:55,360
nations and continents are you saying

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:59,200
the map is wrong oh dear yes now look at

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,840
Greenland okay now look at Africa

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,490
okay you two land masses appear to be

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,960
roughly the same size yes

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:10,350
what a blow your mind if I told you that

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:13,180
Africa is in reality 14 times larger yes

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,130
here we have Europe drawn considerably

00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,990
larger than South America when it's six

00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,200
point nine million square miles South

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,170
America is almost double

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,300
the size of Europe's 3.8 million Alaska

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,610
appears three times as large as Mexico

00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,450
when Mexico is larger by 0.1 million

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,070
square miles

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,600
Germany appears in the middle of the map

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,490
once in the northernmost quarter of the

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,260
earth-boy

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:34,760
relative size is one thing but you're

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,410
telling me that Germany isn't where we

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:41,500
think it is nothing is where you think

00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:44,740
it is where is it I'm glad you asked it

00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:48,410
the Peters projection

00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:50,510
it has fidelity of access fidelity of

00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,820
position east-west lines are parallel

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,760
and intersect north-south axes at right

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,190
angles what tell is that it's where

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:09,650
you've been living this whole time

00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:11,180
should we continue so you're probably

00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:14,570
wondering what all of this has to do

00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:16,910
with social equality no I'm wondering

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,860
where France really is guys we want to

00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:22,040
thank you very much for coming in hang

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,450
on we're gonna finish this what do maps

00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,500
have to do with social equality you

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,390
asked she asked

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,580
Salvatore Anatoly of the National

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:30,470
Council for social studies argues in our

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:38,150
society we unconsciously equate size

00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:41,510
with importance and even power I'm gonna

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:43,190
check in on Tommy go these guys fine

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,570
bring it in on that map he'll call me

00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,460
right probably not okay

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,560
when third world countries are

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,900
misrepresented they're likely to be

00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,400
valued less when we're cater maps

00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,320
exaggerate the importance of Western

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,120
civilization when the top of the map is

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,220
given him northern hemisphere and the

00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,440
bottom is given to the southern then

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:06,320
people will tend to adopt top and bottom

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,670
attitudes but wait huh world's could you

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:13,670
put the northern hemisphere but on the

00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:16,100
top on the bottom how like this yeah but

00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,580
you can't do that why not cuz it's

00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,580
freaking me out

00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,000
who doesn't love CJ Cregg so this is the

00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:26,650
Gail Peters projection that they showed

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,290
the previous map was the Mercator

00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,960
projection and Peters came up with he

00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,580
described his reasoning for working on

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,080
this as because he saw that the Mercator

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:41,860
projection was like the cartographic

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:44,679
imperialism of the time however any map

00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:47,440
that lays flat is naturally distorted

00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,730
even this projection is distorted so I'm

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,140
not even going to show you what it would

00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,280
look like upside down because I don't

00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,890
want to freak you out any more than you

00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:59,200
probably already are but as in politics

00:26:53,890 --> 00:27:01,299
all identities are local and I say that

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,919
because as developers one of the things

00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:05,650
that we work with the most is actually

00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:08,799
Maps it's how I got started developing I

00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,960
joined map time LA and worked on map

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,650
mapping projects with open street maps

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,390
and in the open street map community

00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,750
they call the Google map strategy the

00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:21,880
Starbucks test which is that they only

00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:24,580
invest money into mapping when it's

00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:28,270
close enough to it's a closed radius to

00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:31,120
a chain coffee store and experts

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:34,660
estimate that and so like OpenStreetMaps

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,690
does this work to map in areas that are

00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,549
less accessible but experts estimate the

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,130
two to five percent of OpenStreetMap

00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:44,080
contributors are women only two to five

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,240
percent but the humanitarian

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,860
OpenStreetMap steam did a gender

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,340
equality study recently that found that

00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:54,100
28% of remote mappers are women so

00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:57,370
remote mappers in under service parts of

00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,900
the world and when working directly with

00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,910
people from communities in desperate

00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:04,990
areas forty-eight percent were women

00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:07,570
that's practically that's equality forty

00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,400
eight percent is equality but keep in

00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,620
mind that the barrier of entry for these

00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,290
women is much higher these are in parts

00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,690
of the world where the gender norms mean

00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:19,299
that the women have much more work that

00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,669
they have to do on top of that they're

00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:24,370
volunteering their own personal time to

00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:28,120
go in math in crisises in puerto rico in

00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:30,309
tat and tasmania in africa like these

00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,840
are people who they could be putting

00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:33,850
their time towards

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,070
their own personal lives but instead

00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,870
they volunteer it because mapping is

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,789
about navigating the world safely and

00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:44,950
for women in developing countries that

00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:47,890
safety is harder to secure and we can

00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,960
make a better more inclusive internet by

00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:52,809
working on breaking out of these

00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,580
categories that we don't even see that

00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:57,549
are around us breaking out of these

00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:00,130
boxes and questioning the things that

00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:03,279
the analogies and the words and the ways

00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:05,980
that we talk about the world around us

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,740
and taking a look taking a really hard

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,049
look at ourselves and considering how

00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,720
unconscious bias plays into our life

00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:17,710
because how can we constantly talk about

00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:20,110
our love of problem-solving which to me

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,940
is the soul of engineering and not want

00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:24,549
to solve the interpersonal problems on

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,549
our team and in the world at large

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:29,500
for me it's the reason why I do this

00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:31,360
work the reason why I do workshops on

00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,159
intersectionality and inclusivity the

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,710
reason why I give talks about

00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:38,740
unconscious bias is because as much fun

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,840
as it is to solve a bug these are the

00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,450
problems that are affecting people's

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,490
lives directly and these are the issues

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,730
that really need to be solved

00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:51,549
first and foremost so I hope that that

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,320
inspired you to take a look at your

00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:56,159
lives and thank you so much jazz cafe'

00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,159
