Title: Madalyn Parker - Uncharted territory: using aXe to forge a path
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: JSConf Australia 2018
Description: 
	I remember attending my first JSConf in 2014 and watching Marcy Sutton talk about accessibility and the Shadow DOM. I was hooked on creating an accessible web for everyone. However, it's really hard to get accessibility prioritized when you're running as a lean startup.

Years later, my company is ready to hop on the train and now we're working to implement the first ever ADA compliant chat box used in a support and sales context. I've seen lots of talks on accessibility basics and implementing aria on static sites, but few that demonstrate what it's actually like to approach a codebase architected without accessibility in mind (especially one that will run on sites you have no control over) and add that layer in.

I'm working on this project now (with a due date of Dec 2017) so I don't have immediate outcomes to list here but I'll cover the problems I ran into and will hopefully be able to help other developers in similar situations with their code bases.

I want to show that it's okay to roll out accessibility changes bit by bit, that it doesn't have to be all or nothing, and that there are good tools out there to help you out. I think the stumbling blocks I come across (and overcome) in this project would be useful for others who find themselves in my position. Part of what made this project difficult was my inability to accurately estimate how long or how much work it would take to update our application. Hopefully, with the lessons I learn, Iâ€™ll be able to help someone else blaze their own trail at their company.

00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:24,509
hi there so I am Madeline and I am here

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,510
to talk to you about forging a path in a

00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:31,260
web application that was built without

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,260
accessibility in mind as a novice who

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,140
knew sort of the basics of accessibility

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,140
but had only really seen it implemented

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,339
in simple applications or from the

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,110
ground up and I basically didn't really

00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:49,199
know what I was doing here but I thought

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,199
that my journey might help some of you

00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,000
because I feel like this is the story

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,739
that a lot of developers have where

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,080
they're thrown into an application that

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,080
exists already that is pretty complex

00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:05,549
and was built without this layer in mind

00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:08,760
without inclusion for everyone in mind I

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,220
work at ole arc we make a chat widget

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,470
that sits on your site so that you can

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,480
talk to those who visit your site and

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,360
this is a really amazing thing that

00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,010
allows your site to be more usable for

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,920
someone who is having issues with your

00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,920
technology or who can't find that help

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,890
article and I think it was really

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,840
important to make chat usable for

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,240
absolutely everyone especially those who

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:42,300
might be able to benefit from chat the

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:44,340
most so ooh why accessibility why is

00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,370
this something that we talk about why am

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,030
i talking about it why should you care

00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,700
why is this important there are lots of

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,080
reasons that people talk about it I am

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,010
not really going to talk about any of

00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,270
them because I think that this is way

00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,460
less important than the fact that

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,460
everyone should be able to use the web

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:14,410
the web is this magical place where you

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,209
can accomplish things that you wouldn't

00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,530
be able to otherwise where you can

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,840
connect with people that you wouldn't

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,730
know otherwise where you have access to

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,900
information that you didn't even know

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:28,480
was out there and the fact that some

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,750
large portion tens of millions of people

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,520
in the US alone based on surveys and

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,060
statistics so I guess I'd mentioned one

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:41,920
of them are unable to use the web

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,959
effectively so I'm gonna revisit this

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,510
question again later but I'm going to

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,590
talk about that that was the Y that I

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,170
just talked about it's talked about the

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,470
what of this problem what is web

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,980
accessibility about and when I started

00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:00,130
my project I thought this was about

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,680
following that map about looking at that

00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:06,160
path that was already forged before me

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,980
and making it a little bit wider making

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,120
sure that you know the brush was out of

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,510
the way and that someone could you know

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,400
reasonably follow after me so this meant

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,150
meeting a lot of standards and then

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,660
being compliant with these rules that

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,640
someone else had had made up and I

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,799
thought that this was a major blocker on

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,989
me shipping I thought okay I had to meet

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,700
absolutely everything I had to make sure

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,680
that this works with every technology

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,989
every screen reader every operating

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,000
system every browser I have to make sure

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:41,019
that every single element on my page is

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,489
reachable by the keyboard and so that

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:47,560
boils down to rules I'm a rule follower

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,000
it's just how I'm wired and so when I

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,560
see this list of things I'm like okay

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,810
well I do this and then I do this then I

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,220
do this and that's how I accomplish this

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:59,260
thing is by following these rules

00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:01,750
easy-peasy oh one quick thing I am going

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,840
to be talking about screen reader usage

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,840
mostly there are plenty of other ways to

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,640
make your application accessible but

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,190
this is the main thing that I attacked

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:18,190
in this application given my limited

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:19,810
resources so I had these epic X

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,770
Haitians in the back of my mind I had

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:25,060
these rules that I was going to follow

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,280
here's a picture of me on an actual

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,920
backpacking trip and now I have to

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,800
decide what goes with me on that trip

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:36,040
what tools do I have with me already

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,490
just with me what do I pack in my bag to

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,580
help me forge that path and then maybe

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,100
build a bridge so that you know everyone

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,740
can see the wonderful views and everyone

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,620
can hit the amazing checkpoints

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:56,290
throughout this forest that isn't an

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:58,240
accessible app and I wasn't really sure

00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,210
what should go in that pack from the

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,660
beginning because how do you approach

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:08,650
this real-world abstract problem in this

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:12,250
inaccessible application started in 2007

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,800
or 2009 that I mean you know what legacy

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,630
code is like it's it's been through many

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,280
different versions and it's been built

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,890
upon and built upon and built upon and

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,240
there are many layers involved and then

00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,370
there's this additional layer with our

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,400
chat box where it sits on sites that we

00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,470
have no control over and so to make sure

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,680
that it works with other people's stacks

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,730
and it makes make sure that it works

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,440
again with different browsers and

00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,790
different technologies but something

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,020
that I had in the back of my mind and I

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,760
wasn't really sure where to start I did

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,090
have this part figured out but I think

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,050
it's important to talk about scoping I

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,330
knew that I was going to be working on

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:53,020
our chat box but I think it's important

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,730
to ask these questions what is small

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,370
enough for me to cover with the time and

00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:01,480
resources I have what could benefit the

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:04,240
most from updates and what has the

00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,580
farthest reach and in my case that was

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,280
the chat box it was fairly well

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,910
contained the UI had been updated

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,669
recently to use react and redux so and

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,100
react lends itself very well to

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:20,980
accessibility it could definitely stand

00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,710
to benefit the most because it was the

00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,440
oldest application and it does have the

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,630
furthest reach if I had started with our

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,260
help center or our marketing pages or a

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:34,210
different front-end part of our our site

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,340
like our billing app or configuration

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,800
that would reach our customers and

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:42,220
that's a sizeable amount but it wouldn't

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,990
reach their customers so that's an

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,810
exponential reach there's our chat box

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,479
is on so many sites and it would help so

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:53,380
many more people than just editing our

00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:55,900
site so then I took stock of my

00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,570
resources I laid things on the table and

00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,960
I said okay what do I have to work with

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,539
here

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:06,760
I had me I had one month I had this

00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:09,490
amazing opportunity where I changed

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:13,169
teams mid product cycle which meant that

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:15,100
I had a month before the next one to do

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:19,419
something I was really passionate about

00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:21,940
and that was accessibility I had browser

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:25,690
audit tools most modern browsers have

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,880
these audits that you can do similar to

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,830
the one that Britney talked about just

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,900
before this and one of them is

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,789
accessibility so you can run an audit

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,010
and they'll tell you all of the more

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:37,900
obvious holes that are in your website

00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,960
things that you need to fix like this

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,390
image doesn't have an alt tag or I'm not

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,750
sure what this div does things like that

00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:49,660
I could talk to consultants there are

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,910
many places that can do this this audit

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,340
for you and give you advice and are a

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,460
lot more have a lot more expertise than

00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:01,900
I do but given the first two bullets

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:04,720
here me one month I skipped this part I

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:08,200
did consult the web I liked community

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,240
and they are wonderful and welcoming and

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,160
lovely and they helped me with a couple

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,630
problems that I wasn't quite sure how to

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,460
approach on my own and then I was found

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,940
out that I could automate some of this

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,289
through node modules and from the title

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,310
of my presentation I'm sure you know

00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:26,830
that I'm going to talk a lot about axe

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,220
core and then react Alli is another

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:33,370
wonderful one I include both on load for

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,900
each of our applications and then it

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,140
will pop all of those audit results

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,599
right into the console as warnings so

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,280
it's really obvious when you know

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,289
something is inaccessible on whatever

00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,709
component

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:50,430
part of your app you are working on in

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:52,230
whatever state it's in at that point so

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,680
this is everything I decided to bring

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:59,100
with me so again I'm gonna talk about

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,240
Acts for a second I was pretty biased in

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,190
choosing this particular technology

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,290
partly because it is created by DQ

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:11,370
systems which happens to be based in Ann

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:13,889
Arbor Michigan where I live and they

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,319
they in addition to having an awesome

00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:19,230
open-source tool that you can use to

00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:22,800
automate some accessibility things do

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:24,690
consulting and also do education I about

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,529
halfway through working on this project

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,959
I attended our free webinar that they

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:33,980
had called how persons with disabilities

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:38,009
use the web and it featured a panel of

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,899
people with varying experiences who

00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:43,290
talked about their reliance on screen

00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,910
readers and when you think about screen

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,269
readers or at least when I did in the

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,850
beginning

00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:49,889
I I knew immediately that those with

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,230
blindness would be using the screen

00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:55,319
reader but it didn't occur to me that um

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:59,870
you know those with lower vision or

00:09:55,319 --> 00:10:05,880
those with short-term memory loss or

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:08,220
those who have traumatic brain injuries

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,589
those who are having difficulty

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,880
concentrating like those with autism all

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:18,569
rely on the screen reader also a lot of

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,639
people suffer from chronic pain and have

00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:22,529
mobility issues and you know using a

00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,480
mouse with that fine motor control is

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,790
really difficult for them and so

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,069
navigating by keyboard is really really

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,310
important and realizing all of these

00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:34,139
different use cases really opened my

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,389
eyes to like all of these different

00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:39,560
people that I could reach and how much

00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:42,240
more robust I could make our application

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,610
so the other reason I'm biased here is

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,819
because Marcy Sutton look this woman up

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:51,569
she is the queen of accessibility works

00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:53,550
on Act's core and she gave the first

00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:56,670
success of lady talk that I ever saw at

00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,640
jeaious comp us 2014

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,810
and she absolutely blew my mind and it

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,570
was something that I was sort of already

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:08,640
interested in but dislike clinched it

00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:11,940
that I needed to be working on this so

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,060
my game plan here was to get explore

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,190
working with my testing stack run those

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,840
audit tools and all of my components

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,950
make sure it was included in my front

00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:25,410
end components address those results do

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:32,090
some manual testing and then address

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:35,940
those so why did I start with testing

00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:41,010
it's because um there are many reasons

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,540
but let's go through a few it provided a

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,250
structured way for me to start chipping

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:48,830
away at the problem in front of me again

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:51,210
I am a rule follower so if I have a set

00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,690
protocol here I I know what I'm doing

00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,550
and so automating this step instead of

00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,890
me going through the browser and looking

00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,420
what was in the console and you know

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,760
running through absolutely every state

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:06,210
of my app it's gonna take a lot of time

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,670
and doing this is way faster so having

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:13,140
this tool with which to like blaze my

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:16,830
path was amazing the other great thing

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,960
is that it's really repeatable so I

00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,880
could put this in one component and then

00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,220
copying my tests into all the rest of

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,460
the components and quickly see which

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,220
one's failed and fix those problems

00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:31,950
really quickly then it even goes another

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,720
level because my team could look at the

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,250
stuff that I had just done and ported to

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,280
their projects and now all of their

00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,650
projects were tested furthermore if I

00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,350
updated any one of those components and

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,570
it broke my tests I would know that

00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,370
there was an accessibility issue even if

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,920
you know I hadn't run it in a real

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:54,750
browser and technically my code looked

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:58,500
good so these were all reasons that I

00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:02,490
wanted to start with text so let's talk

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:06,090
about what that actually involved the

00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:08,470
main function that ax core has for

00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:10,689
running an audit is called ax run

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,549
it takes context which is a section of

00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:14,979
the Dom we are testing so you pass it

00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:17,439
either the document that's on the Dom or

00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:20,679
a specific node and then you give it

00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,319
options like it's okay if we don't look

00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:28,389
at color contrast right now or let's

00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:30,699
ignore plain divs or let's look at these

00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:32,109
specific selectors let's you know pair

00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:34,660
down which ones we care about right now

00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:37,479
and then you pass in a callback to be

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,479
called after the audit actually runs and

00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:42,160
that result returns these results which

00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,669
are arrays of what passed and what

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,769
didn't

00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:48,039
so there's an array of violations an

00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:53,589
array of what passed and I mostly looked

00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:57,069
at that array of violations so this code

00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:57,579
is based on a gist that I found of Marcy

00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,649
Sutton's

00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:04,899
I will be tweeting out resources at the

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:07,269
end of this where we automate those

00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:11,279
tests and make a component that we can

00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:15,730
just include in our test files and then

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:19,209
use it to run those tests and I tried to

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,129
make this as like stack agnostic as

00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:23,499
possible so that it's not relying on any

00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:27,429
one framework but note that it is in

00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:31,839
CoffeeScript because I am one of the few

00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:34,869
people that really likes CoffeeScript so

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,910
in this first one note that I am

00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:40,329
creating a brand new context of the DOM

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:42,339
and this is used using a component that

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:44,739
I wrote that consists of very few

00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:47,709
functions that I will also be tweeting

00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:52,089
out synergist that used uses jeaious Dom

00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:54,100
and so I created a new Dom I get the

00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:59,259
document of that Dom I create a div and

00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:02,949
attach it and then I mount my component

00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:05,350
to that div and then I return the

00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:08,889
wrapper the div and the DOM and I need

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,470
the div and the Dom so that later I can

00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:12,909
clean up after myself because when

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,289
you're tweaking the DOM and your

00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:18,129
mounting things and then you're changing

00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:19,659
States it's important to make sure that

00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:21,279
all of your tests don't get those side

00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:23,889
effects

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:28,470
so afterwards I removed that div from

00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:31,449
the Dom and I blow it away entirely and

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,160
here's the larger function which is more

00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,889
complicated than it looks I mean it

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,920
looks more complicated than it is

00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:41,410
and I actually run the audit I take my

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,430
node which in my case is usually just a

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:53,199
raw component I react for component and

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:56,290
then I return a promise and I run my axe

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,649
cores out run with that node and the

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:01,209
config and if during that audit

00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:03,730
something goes wrong I reject that

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,439
promise and otherwise I try and assert

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,319
things and I want to make sure that

00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:11,439
there are no violations so I assert that

00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:12,910
there are no violations has violations

00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:14,980
as false and that the length of the

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,899
violation list is zero and if that's the

00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:21,519
case I resolved my promise my test

00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:26,050
should pass otherwise I reject it so my

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,720
testing flow is pretty simple I required

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,819
this module that I've created my ally

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,410
helper at the top of the document which

00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:35,709
is not in my code here but that's what I

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,660
did and then I say it shouldn't have

00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:39,699
accessibility errors I've created a

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,990
pretty simple component here which is

00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:46,149
just renders an image and it takes URL

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,839
and alt text as parameters and then puts

00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:52,180
those into the image tag and if I render

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,670
the image component and I don't put

00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,910
anything in the alt text it will found

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,019
fail my ally test which is awesome which

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,790
is why I started with the image

00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:05,199
component because it's really easy to

00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:09,250
fail a test without that alt text but

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:12,909
yeah that is the nitty-gritty of my

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:15,449
testing and this is awesome because it

00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:16,949
caught a lot of my problems it worked

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,720
really well

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:22,179
this alerted me to the fact that all of

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,860
the SPG's in my project weren't properly

00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:27,880
described and so a screen reader like

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:30,250
had no idea what they were it alerted me

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,899
to the fact that a lot of my inputs were

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,570
improperly abled and didn't have on

00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:38,919
change events

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:41,500
what else this find of this family like

00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:44,019
links that we were using as buttons or

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,779
things that had the wrong rolls all

00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:49,990
sorts of things that you know I I could

00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:53,200
have cleared on my own but it would have

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,909
taken me way more time and the fact that

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,470
this was repeatable and automated and

00:17:54,909 --> 00:18:01,960
quick was really powerful

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:04,899
so with that past cleared I can see the

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,629
bigger issues in my application I could

00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:11,769
figure out what I needed to move

00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:14,440
physically manually so I'm just gonna go

00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:16,809
through the UI of our chat box and point

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,460
out what a user should be able to do and

00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:21,970
then what they were able to do using a

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:25,409
screen reader in the keyboard so here we

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:28,299
have a collapsed version of our chat box

00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:30,340
above it is our attention grabber which

00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:32,169
just bounces and draws your eye from

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,519
wherever it is on the page down to the

00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:37,750
bottom right where the chat box usually

00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:39,669
lives it's just a visual element and

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,899
then there's the actual chat button that

00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:44,529
has some call to action text and an SVG

00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:48,940
representing whether someone is

00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:50,460
available a chat box or an envelope if

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,230
it's going to be asynchronous in

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,789
communication and it will be an email

00:18:53,230 --> 00:19:00,610
instead of a chat that the user can

00:18:54,789 --> 00:19:03,070
expect and they could get to that that

00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,899
they could read that call to action text

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:08,460
they could see contact Madeleine that

00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:12,190
gets the rainbow I can see a pretty view

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:15,700
but they couldn't really see the image

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,830
for the attention-grabber that SVG was

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,659
broken and knowing that the chat box is

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,399
there at all was really hard for a

00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,899
screen reader user because if you're

00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:24,340
using a screen reader in the keyboard

00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:26,200
you're starting at the top left of the

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,990
page and you are experiencing the web

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,059
linearly which means that you are going

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,070
through a page from left to right from

00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:36,129
top to bottom and where's the last place

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:38,049
you get bottom right so it's unlikely

00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:42,100
that person even knows that chat is

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:43,600
available and there and so I have trees

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,809
to the left and I was asked why are

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,810
trees bad as because they're blocking my

00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:51,980
view from the beautiful

00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:55,520
rainbow so I get to find an effective

00:19:51,980 --> 00:20:03,800
emoji that went was my wilderness theme

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:05,960
so here is a conversation in action user

00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,480
can see that there is a button to end

00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,620
the chat there is a button to collapse

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,780
the chat and then there is an text area

00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:20,150
where they can enter the chat and press

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:25,250
ENTER to send it three rainbows but that

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:28,010
SVG at the top is a broken they again

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:34,460
can't see the attached file SVG or the

00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:37,490
sin chat SVG the actual chat they can't

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,680
see it all unless they do a lot of heavy

00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:42,430
lifting and as chats come in its just

00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,910
radio silence from the screen reader and

00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:49,820
then I have another red box here because

00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:52,310
if the chat box opens which you can do

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,830
with JavaScript or you can do if the

00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:57,140
chat is initiated from the other end not

00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,850
the visitors end it will pull your

00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,030
cursor from wherever it is on the page

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:06,890
and put it right here and how terrible

00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:08,780
is that if you are like using a screen

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,770
reader and reading some part of the page

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,900
and then all of a sudden you're not

00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,660
where you expect it to be that's a

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:20,630
horrible experience

00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:23,060
so five trees and you know what because

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,860
this is the main reason that the

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:31,010
application exists chat I'm adding more

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:33,500
trees because it's making it harder so

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:36,290
here's an offline no this is after the

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,780
chat has ended and you can still see the

00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,700
conversation there are a couple buttons

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,400
you can press here and then there's

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,260
message saying the chat is ended

00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,790
you can press that button that says send

00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,830
transcript you can press the button that

00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:52,790
says write chat and you can press the

00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:55,190
button that says start conversation from

00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:58,670
the keyboard using screen reader three

00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,090
rainbows however again you can't see

00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:04,080
those SPG's

00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:05,940
and you can't really see the previous

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,260
messages and you don't see the chat has

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:13,020
ended message and then even worse but I

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,600
didn't include this on the slide if you

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:21,630
click on send transcript or write chat

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:25,010
it pops up a module which is just like

00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:28,260
on the Dom this is still on the Dom and

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:32,130
it lays it over whatever was there

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:34,380
before so it's the ten it is possible

00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,660
that your cursor is trapped here and if

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,740
you continue to tab it will continue to

00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,360
go in these elements and you won't

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,430
actually get to you know fill out the

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,500
centra and transcript form or do the r8

00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:47,400
chat survey because you can get there

00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:51,570
and that's terrible so more trees than

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:55,380
rainbows once again so here is our

00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:57,660
offline chat box not here every times

00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,300
I'd still have to hear from you you can

00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:03,090
see that like a way message there is a

00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,940
forum where you can enter your name and

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:10,470
your email and an actual note and then

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:13,140
send it that's all great however you

00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:16,230
can't see which ones are required and if

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:20,060
any errors come up like if you type in

00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:22,950
an invalid email address for example

00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:25,500
that error message is not communicated

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,770
via screen reader at all again just

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,350
silence you'll have no idea what's wrong

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:34,500
and if you press send you you don't

00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:37,110
really know that anything happens so a

00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,470
lot of events aren't really making it so

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:42,530
I noticed I distilled all of this

00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:46,140
information down into a few categories

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,520
there was some extra elements a lot of

00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,010
stuff was on the page that you couldn't

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,770
necessarily see I had some navigation

00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,750
issues I had those hidden elements where

00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:58,710
things are overlapped and then there

00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,540
were live areas the chat itself that

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:06,150
were totally inaccessible to a screen

00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:08,390
reader so at this point I had assess to

00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,560
the path before me and I had moved away

00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,720
quite a bit and it was time to build

00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:16,020
something new

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:20,250
and pruning is not something you think

00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:22,110
of is building but I think everyone can

00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,610
agree that some of the best pull

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:28,680
requests are those that have a lot of

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:30,210
removals so I looked at this and I said

00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,040
what can go and this is something that I

00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:34,320
talked to the web Ally community about I

00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,350
was like okay I have this visual element

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,790
that sits above our chat box that's

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,200
called the attention grabber that's

00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,790
supposed to bring your i from wherever

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,460
it is on the page down to the bottom

00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:47,580
right but if someone has worked hard

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,260
enough to tab through all the way

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,390
through linearly to the bottom right of

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,040
the page and they get there that's one

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,560
more hurdle before they get to the

00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,320
actual chat it's just another barrier

00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:01,110
and they're like yeah hide that we don't

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,240
need that so sometimes in order to

00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:06,180
create a good experience you do have to

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:11,400
exclude some things so that is Aria

00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:13,920
hidden then I place some new trails like

00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,150
I said it's it's unlikely when you get

00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,530
on a page that you're gonna know

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,990
something is sitting in the bottom right

00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:25,680
that might help you so one of the first

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:29,910
things that I did was to create a link

00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:32,160
to the chat box and that link allows us

00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:36,300
an ID on the chat box which allows us to

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,920
link from the top right to the top left

00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,310
to the bottom right which is super

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,130
helpful

00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,930
then there was adjusting focus and just

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:47,280
making sure that you know all of these

00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:50,970
overlaid UI is respected what was on top

00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,650
in both in tabindex and Aria hidden so

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,930
that you know someone's cursor moved to

00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,480
where it needed to be depending on what

00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,980
was on top of the chat box and here's

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,180
where it gets really powerful

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:06,930
turn-by-turn directions this is the

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:09,570
material that I used for my bridge there

00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:12,240
we go our announcer and on the Left

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,740
you'll see are really simple div it's a

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,410
div with a paragraph in it that has some

00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:20,130
text but the power is in the attributes

00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:22,650
on that div tag aria-live is basically

00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,630
saying how annoying should this div be

00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,129
and i have it set to assertive which is

00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,139
the most annoying

00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:31,619
you can tell it to be polite or to be

00:26:28,139 --> 00:26:33,360
off aria atomic means hey let the user

00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:37,409
know when something in this div changes

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:41,789
and then the role of alert means anytime

00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:43,230
something happens shout it out and often

00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:45,690
with a chat box that role would be log

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,820
because a chat is a log of things but

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,009
this is a list of events that happen in

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,259
the chat box it's not the chat myself so

00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:57,570
this gets the role of alert and then

00:26:52,259 --> 00:27:03,149
this was hidden from the UI via CSS is

00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:07,950
awesome clip functionality and my excuse

00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:11,489
for making this extra annoying and an

00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:13,529
alert was because I manually controlled

00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:16,799
when we actually make those changes in

00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:19,259
state so I said if the chat box is focus

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,999
add that event text to our list of

00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:22,859
announcements then join that list of

00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:24,509
announcements with periods and then dump

00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:27,210
that list into the announcer and then

00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:29,369
the announcer will read it out and if

00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,139
otherwise just add it to the list of

00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:33,840
announcements and when it's focused

00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:36,330
it'll get dumped in and so you can see a

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,549
chat box here the user says hello there

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:41,220
the announcer reads out you sent hello

00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:43,710
there let's say they deviate away and

00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,950
they come back and messages have

00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:49,489
happened it'll say Madeline is typing

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:53,309
Madeline sent hi how can I help you

00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:56,539
Madeline sent sorry I'm back and if

00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:58,889
there were errors it would say you know

00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:01,710
or if the chat ended it would say like

00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:04,549
chat has ended it would it would read

00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:07,200
out all of these events and this is

00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:12,659
really powerful this is wonderful live

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:15,119
regions are magic so again what does web

00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:17,940
accessibility about how is what is the

00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:22,919
what before I thought it was rules

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:25,080
it's about usability it is about making

00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,419
sure that your actions are repeatable

00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,330
that the accessible thing is the easy

00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:32,669
thing that patterns are established that

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:34,230
someone doesn't lose energy going

00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,669
through your site because it takes a lot

00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,529
of energy to remember what the screen

00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:38,380
reader has said and to get work your way

00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:40,750
through a web

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,700
right it's about starting somewhere I

00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,559
did not accomplish absolutely everything

00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,230
our chat box is not quote-unquote a

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,150
hundred percent compliant but you know

00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,980
it's part of the way there I chipped

00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:54,070
away and now whoever follows me is able

00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,350
to make more strides those steps add up

00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:59,020
and that means that we can iterate on

00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:01,289
this is if there's a small thing that

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,700
you can do in your project go for it

00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:08,530
it's okay that you you know don't have

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,400
to do everything 100% so thank you for

00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,559
listening to me

00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,570
I can't get through a presentation

00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,690
without showing my rabbits they are

00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:18,159
fantastic and adorable my slides are

00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,559
here I will be putting more resources

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,039
into them because I think my resource

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,049
list is incomplete at this point thank

00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:29,020
you so much I hope I've sparked some

00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:32,050
like inspiration in you to work on

00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:37,150
accessibility because it's so important

00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:37,150
[Applause]

00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,080
