Title: Caleb Sotelo - Taming the World’s Largest Trojan Horse
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: JSConf Australia 2018
Description: 
	In 2017, companies globally spent $80B on digital advertising—web pages and mobile apps—delivering ads to billions of users, trillions of times. The majority of these ads were rendered in JavaScript environments. Technically, the challenge for JS developers is to instantaneously find the perfect match between an advertiser and a user, regardless of the website, app, or user profile. This is fun. But economically, we’ve been incentivized to create a global delivery mechanism for arbitrary code onto every connected device, without a care for user experience. It’s the world’s largest, and spammiest, Trojan Horse, and JS developers created it.

(1) Construction — What does this Trojan Horse look like at a technical level? This section covers JavaScript constructs that are really unique to ad-tech, including the rise and anatomy of the “ad tag”, creating sandboxes for arbitrary markup, cookie tracking and pixel syncing, and the impression beacon.

(2) Payload — What kinds of undesirable things are being delivered to publisher properties, and onto our devices? This section goes beyond specific examples of ad quality issues, sniffing, tracking, and malware, also looking at a longer-term invasion happening beneath our feet: have content creators begun trading clicks for a kind of dystopian digital future where ad blockers are simply common sense?

(3) Inversion — What can we as JS developers do about all this? This section argues that we have the power to change ad technology from a Trojan Horse into a powerful message delivery system, one that allows the coexistence of free content, advertising, and delightful user experiences. Ethical and optimistic developers will be the Trojan Horse inside the Trojan Horse.

	00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:18,130
hello good late afternoon

00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,390
here don't really thank you because this

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,640
is the last talk of the day it's after

00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:26,800
30 minute break got you all you know

00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:29,020
loaded up on choc tops so thanks hope

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,910
this is interesting to you hope we can

00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,900
like explode brains in a kind of a new

00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,670
and different way in this last talk so

00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,970
let's get started I'm Caleb I'm

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,590
currently a software architect I've

00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,660
worked at the same company for six years

00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:48,670
it's called open X it's an ad exchange

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:50,860
in Southern California Pasadena I was a

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:54,510
JavaScript engineer there for five years

00:00:50,860 --> 00:01:02,320
and then I just transitioned to oh no

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:11,050
screensaver alright just gotta bring up

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:13,590
my speaker notes again well looks like

00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:17,950
we exited presentation mode so let's

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,750
just go with this right so I'm an

00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,750
architect now which means I get to fix

00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,869
all the code dead I created for myself

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,610
starting in 2012 and we're gonna talk

00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:30,369
about taming the world's largest Trojan

00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,140
horse so let's start with digital

00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:34,450
advertising and actually I'm curious how

00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,050
many of you work directly in AD

00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:40,630
technology okay it's like 10 15 people

00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,340
how many of you in the course of your

00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,560
jobs have to interact with that

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,270
technology or work on platforms that are

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,330
you know monetize using digital ads okay

00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,759
so good good portion let's define some

00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,450
terms media advertising what is that

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,679
so we have marketers and we have

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,470
audience right marketers are people with

00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:02,050
goods and services you know that they

00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,899
want to sell to an audience now they're

00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,190
like many ways to go about it like one

00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:08,560
less efficient way to do that would be

00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,090
to just like list out all the people in

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,500
the world and go up to them one by one

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,050
and ask them that they wanted to buy

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,780
this thing right that's not super

00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,020
efficient and so we have something

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,340
called media advertising which is where

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,410
the marketer actually gets to the

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,879
audience by way of something that we

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,430
call a publisher which is someone who

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,410
has some kind of like attention real

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,330
estate right so it could be a magazine

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,250
could be a billboard could be a website

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,410
something that the marketer can go to

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,060
and say hey let me place my ad on the

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,660
thing that all the people are looking at

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,600
anyway right and we have brokers which

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,600
are basically you know companies people

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,490
who are aggregating the markets you know

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,980
taking what we call the demand on the

00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:53,350
one side and the supply on the other and

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,690
connecting it and the money is gonna

00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,360
flow from left to right in this diagram

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,090
that's media advertising and here's a

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,930
number for you across the world globally

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,730
in 2017 marketers spent half a trillion

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,400
dollars five hundred eighty four billion

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:16,120
dollars spent on media advertising last

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:18,070
year that's a lot so there's a subset of

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,870
media advertising that I want to talk

00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,970
about for this talk and that's called

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,470
digital display advertising so it's the

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,880
same diagram but the players are just

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,570
kind of like subsets of what they were

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,960
before our audience is Internet users

00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,790
people who are you know connected to the

00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,140
Internet somehow and the marketers are

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,790
pretty much the same marketers but

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,890
they're tapping into Internet connected

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:45,209
audiences I may have to do this every

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,209
five minutes so I don't shut down again

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,260
our publishers our digital display

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,020
publishers as we call and they're folks

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,880
who run publications that are connected

00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,310
to the Internet and that you know have

00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,190
screens right so desktop web app

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,680
websites what mobile apps mobile web

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,140
connected TVs anything that has a screen

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,270
with some pixel real estate that can

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,350
show display ads and is connected to the

00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:12,730
Internet and the broker is digital

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:17,830
display ad tech that's the industry I

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:20,500
work in here's a pie chart that kind of

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,180
gives some higher fidelity to that ad

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,130
spend a number of five hundred eighty

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,810
four billion and we can kind of break it

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,130
down all the blue stuff I highlight

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,900
because that's kind of a bigger category

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,570
called digital in general and it's like

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,610
all Internet connected advertising so it

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:37,600
includes things like search classified

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:41,560
ads the display category is right here

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,700
right and that's 19% of a whole pie I'm

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,320
just going to check if

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:51,400
thing has a laser pointer do we know if

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,280
it has a laser pointer no okay I wonder

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,570
if the person let me borrow it is here

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,170
so the blue stuff right what's

00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,310
interesting about this pie chart is that

00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,890
2017 marks the first year that the

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,320
digital category actually eclipse TV

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:08,050
right so the first time ever traditional

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,730
TV ad spend was at 35% if you add these

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,440
together I think it's 40% that's

00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,530
unprecedented right so this is a very

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,760
large growing category and digital

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,710
display which we're talking about today

00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:23,050
is the largest chunk within digital this

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,870
is a very confusing picture right this

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,410
is the display loom escape and it's kind

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,870
of used in ad tech talks to kind of like

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,000
wave in front of people and say look how

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,380
complicated digital display is right and

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,030
it's really complicated all right so

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,410
this is the same kind of flow as the

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,840
previous diagram where you have

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,090
marketers on one side and publishers and

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,800
the audience on the other side except

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,040
all these are actually companies that

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,050
are you know together they constitute

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:53,170
digital display ad tech it's a lot of

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,480
companies you can see the the dashed

00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,820
lines denote acquired company shuttered

00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,090
companies everyone's kind of merging and

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,440
splitting and growing my company is

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,170
right there it's in this middle box

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,120
OpenX may be hard to see but we're in ad

00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,730
exchange which means we sit pretty much

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,940
smack in the middle of this huge wall of

00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,740
money that's moving across right and you

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,400
know I'd like to say this really

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,960
indicates like the the you know how

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,400
thriving in this industry is right

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,260
there's so much movement so many players

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,610
everyone's kind of jumping up with their

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,610
startup trying to get a piece of the pie

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,230
let's talk about some numbers for

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,540
digital display 110 marketing dollars

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,800
spent 110 billion marketing dollars

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,920
spent right so if you backed out the

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:43,420
math from the 19 percent of the 584 it's

00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:45,780
about 110 users reached on the order of

00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,220
a billion if we just go by Facebook's

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,290
last stat about their monthly active

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,180
users which is 2.2 billion we know

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,430
they're all seeing digital ads so we're

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,110
talking about like large percentages of

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,550
the entire

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,420
world population that's being reached by

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,720
digital display and then something

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,550
called

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,760
ad impression which is really just like

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:08,280
the occurrence of an ad like getting

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,270
from an ad server onto one of these

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,390
publications

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:15,990
I asked me about 10 trillion of those

00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:18,870
happened in 2017 and you know you could

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,560
say if each of these you know three or

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,330
four billion people had a thousand ads

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,340
served to them over the course of the

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,500
year that's a reasonable number right 10

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,140
10 trillion times that an ad was

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,080
actually shown to someone or marketed to

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,610
someone and that brings us the kind of

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,580
the point of this talk and why you know

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:41,010
this is at J esketh and not at you know

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,980
on a an ad tech yacht in the South of

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,620
France right 10 trillion 10 trillion

00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,480
right this number

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,670
why is it important how do you how do

00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,360
you get stuff how do you get arbitrary

00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:57,170
images to show up on websites and web

00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,330
apps and mobile apps and stuff

00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:02,670
JavaScript right so 10 trillion is the

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,800
number of times that JavaScript based

00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,540
ads rendered right and you could say oh

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,310
well what about mobile app right that's

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,620
not really most of these things are done

00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,690
in web views in mobile apps right so

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,090
this this we should be proud of this

00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,530
right JavaScript engineers are helping

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,020
you know they're the gatekeepers of this

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,940
enormous unprecedent unprecedented

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,860
industry half a trillion dollars so

00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,230
round of applause please all of you are

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,270
involved in this somehow right this

00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:31,920
community is powering this kind of

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:34,020
industry and now we get to this metaphor

00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,600
that that the talk is built around this

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,280
Trojan horse right so what happens when

00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,690
you combine a hundred and ten billion

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,030
dollars of economic pressure with a

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,610
platform that can deliver arbitrary HTML

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:50,100
on to properties all across the world

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:53,250
right inevitably some bad things get

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,960
through right and you know I've invoked

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,090
the Trojan horse metaphor so I need to

00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,220
qualify myself which is you know it's

00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:02,310
typically a Trojan horse is we think of

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,800
it as being maliciously designed right

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,420
so ad technology isn't you know doesn't

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,850
have a malicious thought behind it

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,319
however what I am interested in is

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,839
the idea that it's kind of a

00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:16,379
nice-looking container for literally

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:19,739
anything right so any code can come and

00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:22,259
run on a web page or a mobile app and so

00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:24,029
you know we as JavaScript engineers are

00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:27,989
actually you know we're were the

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:29,850
gatekeepers to this kind of thing and we

00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:31,709
have the challenge of you know how do we

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,899
deal with all these kind of latent

00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,220
consequences and undesirable code and

00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,019
things that are running everywhere and

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,100
that's a really challenging thing and

00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,160
that's what I want to share with you

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,729
today so the talk is structured in three

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,769
parts construction payload and inversion

00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:51,959
and I'll explain what these seconds are

00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:53,309
and we get to them part one construction

00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,009
we're going to talk about some really

00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:57,329
basic building blocks of digital display

00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,829
AdTech right and these are just

00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:00,899
JavaScript concepts that we're all

00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:03,119
probably familiar with but they've kind

00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:06,569
of taken on meanings that they're in the

00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:08,100
ad tech world and when you put them all

00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:09,779
together then I think we'll have a

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,910
better understanding of you know what

00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,649
I'm talking about

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,779
first is this thing called an ad tag

00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:18,569
right this is just some arbitrary markup

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:22,499
that's usually handed from you know some

00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:24,389
ad tech company down this way in the

00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:25,819
supply chain right to a publisher so

00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,709
that they can put it on their page and

00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:30,899
when they put it on their like an ad

00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:32,309
shows up right and it's typically in two

00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,709
parts we have something where there's

00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:36,089
like some configuration like declared in

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:37,619
JavaScript you know this is the site

00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,679
that I'm coming from these are the sizes

00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:42,600
that I want to allow in this little box

00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,459
and then there's a call-out to a script

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,069
that's typically called an ad TAC right

00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:49,439
or sorry a tag library so this is a

00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:53,339
hosted script that's hosted by you know

00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:55,109
on some CDN by some ad tech company and

00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,220
it's going to download the JavaScript

00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:58,169
that's going to interpret the

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,029
configuration and kick off what we call

00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:01,679
like an ad request right the process of

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:06,119
sending an HTTP request out of the

00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:07,799
browser and getting an ad back now

00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:09,319
what's important and you can see I've

00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:13,169
kind of highlighted on this second line

00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:16,889
HTML grabbing some property out of the

00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:18,779
ad response object and that hTML is you

00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:22,259
know it's it's also kind of arbitrary

00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,279
markup if we think of ad tag

00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:26,790
is kind of like a delivery mechanism

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,069
then iframes are in AdTech a containment

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,290
mechanism right so we can say I want to

00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:33,419
drop some like random markup from

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,549
someone way up the supply chain into

00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:37,470
this little sandbox and we use iframes

00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:39,660
for that and this is a very

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,189
oversimplified example because there are

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,929
tons of edge cases that come in for

00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:44,970
different browsers and different

00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:47,129
situations with subdomains and all this

00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,119
and typically if you write a tag library

00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:49,379
this is gonna be one of the larger

00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:52,139
functions and you're just gonna like a

00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:53,119
creep like you know arcane knowledge of

00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,489
how to do iframes

00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:58,439
over the years now if you combine add

00:11:56,489 --> 00:12:00,209
tags and iframes what you get is the

00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:04,769
possibility of like you can actually

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:06,359
traffic an ad tag as the ad responds to

00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:08,339
HTML and you can kind of have like

00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:10,619
never-ending chains where like what

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,149
you're actually loading as your ad is

00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:14,160
not an image but it's like another tag

00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,049
that calls out and calls out and like we

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,489
see these like seven or eight levels

00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:19,350
deep sometimes just because how many

00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:23,189
people are actually involved in getting

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:25,739
an ad to show up to more as far as

00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:28,169
construction goes cookies right we know

00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:31,799
and love cookies in AD text they're used

00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:34,889
primarily to identify users consistently

00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:38,009
so here's some code of you know a

00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:40,049
JavaScript based cookie but you can also

00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:42,149
do this on the server side you know a

00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:44,129
server can declare that it wants to set

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:45,809
a cookie the idea is that it gets to

00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:48,059
store a little bit of information on

00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:50,309
behalf of its domain in the in the

00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:53,910
user's browser and we can use this to

00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:57,919
consistently identify a user based on

00:12:53,910 --> 00:13:00,779
some unique ID this would be like a

00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,209
tracking mechanism and then the last one

00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,399
is like an analytics mechanism we have

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:07,949
what we call pixels which is a misnomer

00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,919
but it came from this idea that you

00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:15,149
could just kind of serve an image

00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:18,119
element that would contain some some

00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:20,850
like query yards and when that image was

00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:24,329
was requested it would return like a 1x1

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,709
hidden jiff right and you basically just

00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:27,600
be using the fact that you could render

00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:29,489
an image but also sneak some get

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,809
variables like back to your servers and

00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:33,119
you could have some idea of like what

00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,739
happened as an ad tech company you could

00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:35,980
say oh I know that the person actually

00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:37,810
saw the ad

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,510
and you know I know that the impression

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,680
ID was one two three four five now we do

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,240
this more programmatically with

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,700
JavaScript this is an example from the

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,330
kind of recent navigator dot send beacon

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:53,020
API where we we have the flexibility to

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:54,730
kind of construct a little bit more as

00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,960
far as like the you know things we'd

00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,490
like to send back all right so I'm gonna

00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,590
borrow from the popular mean form mean

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,360
format to kind of like round out the the

00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:08,290
picture of like what it's like to view a

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,150
JavaScript ad tech developer blanks are

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,950
like the most unspecific way of

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,480
reporting a bug but you have to deal

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,190
with them all the time right dad's not

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,170
showing up it's blank what do I do I

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,120
have to go debug I have to go you know

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,950
like a me this morning and be digging

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,760
around all inside the network tab and

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:26,170
find out why is the ad not showing up

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,910
your code versus third-party code this

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,470
is like battle bots right when you write

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,840
JavaScript and put it out there on the

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,310
web you have no idea who else is going

00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,070
to be running in that global variable

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,360
soup I once had a bug where like there

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,130
was literally a library that was the

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,680
name the same as mine and was like

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,390
confusing like you know variables

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,890
stepping all over each other you have to

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,470
write your JavaScript code really

00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,930
defensively when you're an ad tech

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,670
Network tab you know you're gonna be

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,650
there for days like Network Tabak is

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,630
like burned into my retinas is like a

00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:58,780
physical location like I've been there

00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,370
you know should work in all browsers

00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,050
this is a big one right because it

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,270
doesn't matter if Internet Explorer 7

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,430
was sunsetted you know five years ago

00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,620
it's still a big enough percentage of

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:11,770
110 billion dollars that you got to deal

00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:15,040
with it you will be reading lots of

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:17,800
minified code you may break a major

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,080
website and have to wake up and deal

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,250
with it basically don't merge code on

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,220
Fridays because you don't want to work

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,870
on the weekend and then in the ad tech

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,940
version of the waiting for it to compile

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,620
trick you can pretty much look at any

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,760
website you want and just say that

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:36,430
you're you're debugging it all right

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,400
part two so what kinds of things are

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,560
actually coming through right this is

00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,150
broken down into three hashtags first is

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,890
whoops right what are the kind of

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,660
undesirable things they're kind of

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,660
benign alright you have like a really

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,370
nice clean template of a site and it's

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,900
grayscale and modern and then your ad

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,550
comes in right and it's like it makes

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,270
your eyes bleed right you have no

00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,560
control over that

00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:01,240
you know autoplay audio and video right

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,980
this is a great one you ever like you

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,600
know like got your head down you're

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,130
working you know you got your Spotify

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,020
going and then there's like this weird

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,490
voice that's like you're like that's not

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:13,420
part of the song you know what's going

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:15,550
on yeah autoplay audio and video coming

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,980
through adds block list violation so

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,490
you're like this little guy and your

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:24,670
plan minion rush and then all of a

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:27,850
sudden ad comes in that kind of like

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:30,610
challenges your worldview right you know

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,080
that's not what my parents told me and

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,050
you freaked out right so this is like an

00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,550
ad quality block list violation right

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,350
these are just things we're like the

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,580
person who runs this game this mobile

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,280
game probably didn't want that to come

00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:45,220
through and maybe even if they indicated

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,410
that it still came through our solution

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,840
as JavaScript engineers is to build

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,630
feedback loops right so we've we kind of

00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,400
turned to another skill that we have as

00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,740
front engineers which is like building

00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,590
user interfaces and these are some

00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:02,820
pictures from one of our tool suites

00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:05,740
called it's called add protection

00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,600
basically we allow you know users to

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,760
report an ad that they think is

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,740
inappropriate and then we aggregate you

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,720
know these complaints and from you know

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,130
aggregate results from large scale

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,670
scanners that are actually trying to

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,380
render these like on the server side and

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,560
also allow them to be forwarded to

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,450
people more on this side of the supply

00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,910
chain right so if they came from other

00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:31,600
buyers that we like as an exchange as

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:34,450
open X that we deal with we have a tool

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,280
that kind of lets us you know forward

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,330
the information to the right party right

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,480
and so we're we're using our our UX and

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,850
front-end

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,020
skills as JavaScript engineers to build

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,240
these kinds of tools that create

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,220
feedback loops the second one is just

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,870
which is like I take to mean just like

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,410
general low-quality things that ads

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:55,110
cause to happen sometimes so here's one

00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:58,300
where you know I was trying to click on

00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:01,860
a blog post and then you know before I

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:04,090
could click this ad came in and you know

00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,710
no offense to the folks at SendGrid

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,120
they're great but I didn't want to go

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,070
there right I wanted to go to the blog

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,690
post and this is like technically

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,670
actually called PageRank it's when the

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,700
page is actually re-rendering itself

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,740
some people call it reflow but you have

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,980
no control over the code that comes

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,020
through as part of this arbitrary add

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,590
markup right and so it makes the page do

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,720
weird things sometimes large files I

00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,370
can't even like bear to look at this all

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,309
right but no one's gonna keep you from

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:38,980
making your your ad image like 50

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:40,450
megabytes and so here's another one HTTP

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,730
request party right what if you just

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,200
what if your add markup comes in and

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,940
just has tons of requests and this is

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,250
actually from a tool that we built it's

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,720
called add footprint it's a chrome dev

00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,700
tools extension you can download it on

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,150
the chrome store and it kind of breaks

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:58,300
things up by what types of requests are

00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:01,720
actually happening on a page it's kind

00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,670
of like lighthouse for AdTech we break

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,809
it up into content and then add requests

00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,490
so there's initial requests that are

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:08,770
going out of the browser and then ad

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,650
slots like the requests that come from

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:15,160
stuff within that first level of iframes

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:17,559
that gets written out and this kind of

00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,410
has a problem right so we dig in go to

00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:23,530
ad slots we categorize all the ad slots

00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:26,110
on the page and look this 970 by 250 is

00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:30,360
having problems right 12 12 seconds to

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:32,740
load so we click in there and we can see

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,020
basically there's 36 requests that's a

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,150
lot probably don't need that many and

00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,000
there's this one one by one jiff right

00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:44,410
here that's taken almost half a second

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,809
to load so the solution to this problem

00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,140
of Jake eNOS I think aside from building

00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:52,830
tools that let you understand it is to

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:55,270
make performance repeatable right for

00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:58,240
publishers and people building websites

00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:00,640
in general what if we had something that

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,490
would do all these things

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,100
and if you've spoken to the folks

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,300
outside at the MP table this is actually

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,780
just shamelessly copied from their

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:13,780
website right this this is what amp does

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,790
it kind of is a restricted way of

00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,640
writing HTML that includes some

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,860
performance guarantees and what's nice

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,650
about this is not only that it's kind of

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,990
relegating ads away from the main thread

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,990
and making your content great but

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:33,970
there's also like amp for ATS right so

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:35,890
you can start to specify your ads amp

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,850
documents as well and this is really

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,870
cool I think we as a community like have

00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,730
recently started thinking more about

00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,500
performance a lot of the talks today and

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,810
yesterday we're focused on performance

00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,350
and if we kind of aggregate knowledge

00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:51,580
into open source projects like like amp

00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,140
we're gonna make the web better and

00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,810
we're gonna solve Jake eNOS even if it

00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:59,880
comes from third parties the last one is

00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:03,150
shadiness right finger printing so

00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:06,250
finger printing looks kind of benign

00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:09,550
it's this is from an open-source version

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,140
of a finger printer from three years ago

00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,910
it's basically collecting a bunch of

00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,580
random things about what's happening in

00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,780
the browser and creating a unique string

00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,760
out of them so what's the big deal about

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,950
that well basically there's enough like

00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,400
kind of entropy in all the different

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,900
settings and things in in a browser that

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,530
you can kind of mash them together and

00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,220
create a consistent unique ID for that

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,980
environment

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,630
aka user and basically if third-party

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,760
cookies are turned off you can

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,130
consistently identify the user that's

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,120
kind of shady right if user doesn't want

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,890
to be tracked you shouldn't be tracking

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,670
them but this stuff comes through right

00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,750
it adds sometimes force redirects are

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,150
one that's kind of been taken the

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,860
industry by storm last couple years

00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,570
you're on a mobile site and then

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,130
suddenly you're in the App Store

00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,650
right and there's not really much you

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,510
can do about it and this is because an

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,640
ad came through that you know kind of

00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,100
exploited some some holes in the browser

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,750
and was able to open the app store and

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,820
try and get you to download something

00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,360
that you didn't want here's one that's

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,040
top of mind all right so on January 24th

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,330
of this year the number of coin hive

00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,390
miners went up 300

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:18,040
percent all the sudden right and what

00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,350
was happening was that someone was if

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,710
using the double-click ad server to

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,330
insert some web mining code into ads

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:30,160
that were going all over the Internet

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:32,380
and you know getting free coins and this

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,850
is just an example of like what we call

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,890
malvert izing right it's people who were

00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,440
actually doing nefarious things in

00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:41,880
abusing the fact that ad tech delivers

00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:47,320
arbitrary code our solution is to like

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,700
build tools that not only render ads and

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,130
see what they look like and create those

00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,320
feedback loops but actually try to

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,480
understand at a more of a semantic level

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,670
what's happening right like who called

00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,170
who and what did they actually do so

00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:02,170
this comes from our data protection

00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:05,110
suite and it's showing you a diagram of

00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:08,710
like basically tag calls right so this

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:10,270
is from the open XCOM web page home page

00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,770
and there's like a Google tag manager

00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,420
there's not gonna be a lot of ad tech

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,160
stuff here but you can kind of get the

00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,780
sense that like the Google tag manager

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,660
was called and then it loaded a few

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,370
other things right the Google Analytics

00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:24,970
dynamic remarketing some various things

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,440
and this gives us a sense like starts to

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:30,940
give us a sense of like who's actually

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:33,250
doing what on web pages and we've also

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,170
done some work actually analyzing the

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,810
code that comes through and here we've

00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:40,210
classified a bunch of add tags that

00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:42,630
rendered on a page and given them

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,880
indexes as far as security data sharing

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:47,410
user tracking tag chaining by actually

00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,250
like looking at the code that they

00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:53,140
deliver and trying to understand it and

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,700
this is something that kind of like only

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,990
JavaScript engineers can do because

00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,380
we're the ones who understand what

00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:01,000
JavaScript code looks like and something

00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,010
that's really cool is that we've

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,290
implemented a container that I that if

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,630
you load tags through the container on

00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:11,050
your page you can actually block

00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:12,520
specific behaviors that arbitrary code

00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:16,150
may try to do so you can you can

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:18,130
actually turn off you know HTML cookie

00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,270
writing or reading local storage and a

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,770
number of other things you can just

00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:24,220
block those behaviors if you want I

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:26,890
think it's pretty cool so the last and

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,600
quick part of my talk is just like

00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,429
some thoughts about you know where's

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,640
this going what can we as a JavaScript

00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:35,020
community do to make things better

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,549
here's some here's some thoughts right

00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,580
so this is from the the data protection

00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:43,630
tool this is a particularly egregious

00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:47,410
example of just the spam enos of ads

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:51,100
right so this is a homepage the tag

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:58,299
chain diagram of a real you know widely

00:24:51,100 --> 00:25:00,640
used newspaper website 1665 tags and

00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:02,919
pixels that collect data do other things

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,070
from a total of 114 different vendors

00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:10,840
right this is like crazy this is like

00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:12,299
way too much stuff another thought I saw

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,330
this on Twitter just a couple days ago

00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:19,500
some people taking advantage of a new

00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:22,570
feature called HSTs which is meant to

00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:25,240
help you make secure calls more often

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,520
and they exploited the fact that it

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,809
stored some new information in the

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,700
browser and they were using it to do

00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:32,710
fingerprinting and this person says I

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,240
hate how the web has devolved into a war

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,559
between bad actors and advertising and

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,990
engineers who are trying to push the

00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:40,809
state of web tech forward so these these

00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:43,480
last two pictures right they're just

00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:45,730
meant to make us think okay so we can

00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,380
kind of be in this arms race against

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:50,650
people doing bad things and an arms race

00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:54,070
against undesirable janky whoopsy kind

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:56,140
of ads but where is the web going

00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,840
because of all this right are we getting

00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,429
to a place where it's kind of like this

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,299
picture which is an artist rendition

00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:06,429
from later on our 2014 ein where if you

00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:07,990
saw that movie there's like ads

00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:10,059
everywhere right they're plastered all

00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,559
over buildings in every possible square

00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:13,570
inch of available space and not only

00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,070
that they're like highly targeted to the

00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,470
person walking down the street like the

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,790
ad starts talking to the guy right is

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,140
this the world that we kind of want to

00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,900
move to right is this where all the

00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,720
economic pressure is forcing us I want

00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,820
to suggest not and specifically I want

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,220
to bring to our attention this idea of

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,660
something called a native ad now it has

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,100
a pretty plain definition native

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,380
advertising is a type of advertising

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,000
mostly online that matches the form and

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,700
function of the platform upon which it

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,659
appears now here are a couple examples

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:45,009
of thing

00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:47,039
that have been maybe mistaken for being

00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:50,169
native ads but they're not quite there

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,119
first one is you know these kind of like

00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:53,859
from around the web boxes that we often

00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,570
see at the bottom of reading an article

00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:57,309
where you're like oh that looks

00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:00,759
interesting oh wait you're right that's

00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:03,220
not from no the people who wrote the

00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:05,859
article that I just read so it's kind of

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,529
hiding some people call that native not

00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:09,849
really it may look like the content and

00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:13,119
do a good job of getting people to click

00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:15,820
on it it's not just returning your ad

00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,619
with JSON so instead of returning markup

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,659
and just rendering it how it comes it's

00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:21,220
you know natives sometimes people think

00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:23,349
oh that's just you know JSON and then

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,389
you need some actual code on the front

00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:28,179
end to like parse it and do stuff with

00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:30,119
it native ads may involve JSON as a

00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,440
response night but not necessarily and

00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:34,119
then there's this format that's coming

00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,679
around where you're kind of scrolling

00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:37,570
through a page and then like all of a

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,210
sudden like it kind of slides open and

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:42,159
there's a video playing native is not

00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,989
just camel flage that's right

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,679
or as it kind of jump out at you and

00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:50,409
scare you right so what is native done

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,539
and this is my last slide it's just a

00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:55,119
picture of three ads that I think could

00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:58,539
be considered native and helped us you

00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:01,029
know see how we can get away from that

00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:03,070
possible dystopian future this is from

00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:05,379
my blog right and I have a small blog I

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:07,659
write technical articles on it I run it

00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:10,239
on digitalocean servers and so I put

00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:14,049
this like link on there and a couple

00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:15,489
years ago because digitalocean has like

00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:17,139
a referral program and now the blog is

00:28:15,489 --> 00:28:19,149
paying for itself right and it I think

00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:22,299
it matches the form and function of the

00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:24,479
site on which it it lives here's one

00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:28,090
from a publication called The Verge

00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:30,669
where I I'm pretty sure this is an ad

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:34,720
I'm not sure but duolingo can now teach

00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:37,450
you how to speak Klingon and it's like

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,239
you know it's got the same style and you

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:42,129
know colors and stuff and like you know

00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:44,169
that's interesting to me as the reader

00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:47,440
of the verge and so it matches the form

00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:49,059
and function and then last of all you

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,919
know Twitter is a great example right

00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:53,860
because they're monetizing through the

00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,690
very format that the the the platfor

00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,250
was famous for which is tweets right and

00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,580
I just saw this the other day I thought

00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:02,799
it was interesting you know that United

00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,090
actually used a promoted tweet to tell

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,470
people that they had a network outage

00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,900
and are working to get the system's back

00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:10,030
online right that's that's pretty cool

00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,770
right because this indicates that the

00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,420
way that the platform was monetized has

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:18,220
now become like a general purpose

00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,510
messaging and targeting platform and I

00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,230
think that's that's really cool

00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:25,600
and so just final thought is that native

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,910
is hard because what works on my blog

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,890
doesn't work on the verge and doesn't

00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:32,410
work on Twitter and vice versa right and

00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:34,000
so it requires the engineers you and I

00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:36,460
who actually work on these publications

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,260
to do some hard thinking and have some

00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,360
hard conversations about how to make

00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,790
these things viable businesses without

00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,500
you know selling out four clicks right

00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,630
and I think that we're all more than

00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,820
capable of doing that and in the process

00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:51,460
making the internet a much better place

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:59,440
so thank you

00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:59,440
[Applause]
