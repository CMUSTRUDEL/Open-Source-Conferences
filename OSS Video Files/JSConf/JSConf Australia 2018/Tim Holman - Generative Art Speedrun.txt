Title: Tim Holman - Generative Art Speedrun
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: JSConf Australia 2018
Description: 
	For so many of us, myself included, the art world is the entry point into the coding world. Here we will explore ins and outs of generative art, and experience the joy of creating art with code. Generative art can be as simple or complex as you like, at the end of the day, everyone will have the mindset and processes down to create their own unique pieces of joy.

This talk begins with the basics of generative art, a small history, including some of the earliest "code art", proceeding into examples through history leading us here. The goal of the "speed run" is to give the audience as much knowledge about generative art as possible in the given time, while also showing the tooling, and surprisingly few steps it takes to get creating unique and original art. Generally speaking, there is no limitation to the audience of this talk, it really sits on the borderlines of people who enjoy art, code and science, and everyone will take home a different piece of that puzzle.

The talk shows both the simplicity and beauty of generative art, with just a few lines of code, we can put the computer to work creating millions of unique pieces.

hi hey wow it's awesome to be here

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,730
single these smiling faces you might

00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,230
have seen me around I'm kind of full of

00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,200
full of energy so I've been doing a lot

00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,490
of dancing about I am Tim let's just

00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,040
kind of go through the you know the

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,590
admin there's my website there's my

00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,310
Twitter there's my github there's my

00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,210
LinkedIn

00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,800
there's my code pen it's it's it's crazy

00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,900
actually it's my first time speaking in

00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,120
Australia these these are my avatars

00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,650
throughout the last throughout the last

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,000
five years and if you do it backwards it

00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,979
kind of looks like a budding young

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,549
software developer slowly start to

00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:50,409
question his life choices the software

00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:52,089
development not even once

00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:53,979
and if it goes forward it's kind of like

00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:56,110
my hair is growing growing out which is

00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:57,909
nice you may know me from the internet

00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,920
I've done a ton of stuff I'm always kind

00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:01,600
of making five or so years ago I made

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,129
this website you would press this button

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,440
and it would kind of take you to random

00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:08,280
websites online this one's called Elop

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,520
calm and you slap a person with simple

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,290
web development and I made this website

00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,180
and got super popular and I was kind of

00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,520
like whoa I started to get enamored by

00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,810
things online and I started just wanting

00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,980
to make things and make things and make

00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,410
things and make things this is a website

00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,030
that I have inspiring dot online and I

00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,620
just kind of post things on there when I

00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,220
see something fun

00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:34,180
I made this font just last year for for

00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:36,040
a look written for a js' comfy you it's

00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,300
called smell vodka it's beautiful you

00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,320
can install it on your machine and

00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,670
replace the redundant Helvetica you know

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,890
you might have seen these github corners

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,409
online they kind of wave when you when

00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,730
you hover over them that was me it's fun

00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:51,220
to see those kind of all over the web

00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,750
this is something that I made a couple

00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,830
years ago you kind of scroll down and

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,610
you want to go back to the top of the

00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,069
screen

00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,069
[Music]

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:07,759
beautiful right you might know me from

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,759
my LinkedIn profile full of dog pictures

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,349
yeah so I do a lot of stuff online and

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,690
today I'm here to talk about generative

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,819
art generate vada holds a special place

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,260
in my heart because it was kind of the

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,690
reason that I got into development in

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,670
the first place it kind of provided an

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,530
avenue to look at things and make things

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,540
without directly kind of comparing

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,310
myself to all these fantastic developers

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,290
out there and kind of going ah this

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,750
websites so good this is so so advanced

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,370
why can I kind of do that so back into

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,650
the kind of admin stuff generative art

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,870
is that in part or whole has been

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,150
created with you some autonomous system

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,829
and an autonomous system is a system

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,810
where it's kind of out of your hands for

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:47,579
example you could roll a dice and do

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,739
something different each role and that

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,150
is an autonomous system and a speedrun

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,650
is a playthrough of a game with the

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,910
intention of completing it so I'm going

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,049
to teach you how to complete software

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,900
development you won't have to do

00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:00,000
anything after this but no for me the

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,620
speed run aspect of this is to kind of

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,569
give you enough information to say hey I

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,269
can I can create something like this I

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,650
can do it and and and kind of get

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,959
everybody on their own making their own

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,069
stuff so these are the steps I want to

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,319
break it down I want to break down

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:14,850
creating some generator BOTS and I want

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,170
to put it into small small pieces that

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,450
are very digestible I'm very easy to

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,340
understand unlike me because I can't

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,160
stop speaking really quickly I want to

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,370
show the experimental nature of code and

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,160
kind of draw some parallels between

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,049
generative art and regular software

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,340
development and then finally I want to

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,620
kind of get a little bit introspective

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,569
this was kind of something that I like

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,400
to do in my talks where I put something

00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,260
together and when you're making a talk

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,970
you're thinking so much about all these

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,739
aspects of software development and I

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,440
can't help myself but then put that in

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,819
the talk and a kind of inception thing

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,920
it's awesome so I want to introduce this

00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:52,170
idea of a tool belt and we use a tool

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,730
belt when we're developing always when

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,590
you start off you have very few things

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,269
in your tool belt and as you get better

00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,819
and better you kind of have them to draw

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,139
upon and you can go oh I know how to do

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,389
that I've done it before oh I know how

00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,870
to do that I've done it before and and

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:08,760
that aspect of programming is just the

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,870
reason that I really really like it you

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,010
know as time goes on

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,269
you build things up in your tool belt so

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,090
the first thing that I want to add is a

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,229
line this is how you draw a line in

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,060
JavaScript there's a little bit of

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:21,870
setting out that I've missed getting the

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:25,320
context but you essentially have two

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,570
aspects a stop position and X&Y and

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,770
position X&Y and a stroke and I'm

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,540
showing a little bit of code in this

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,820
talk but not really that much and

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,740
nothing really too complex and the

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,630
reason for that is really this is just

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,160
JavaScript example but there's so many

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,660
ways to draw a line on a piece of paper

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,260
and if we get all tangled up in that

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,840
it's like what are we even doing here so

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,850
here's a canvas and here's a line on

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,740
there I've drawn it left to right I

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,990
could draw that from the diagonal side

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,240
to the diagonal side is this generative

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,639
art I don't know it's more like a line

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,770
on the page so let's just introduce a

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,590
little aspect of random math dot random

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,419
returns a number between 0 1 so there's

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,850
around about 50% chance that it's

00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,979
greater than half and then we'll have

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,229
two splits here we'll draw it maybe from

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,630
left to right on one side and from right

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,880
to left on the other side so here again

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,950
is our line and when I click it's kind

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,460
of randomly going from from left to

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:22,710
right is that generative out yet no it's

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,270
still just kind of a line on the page so

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,880
let's introduce some more techniques and

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,169
tiling is the first one and as we kind

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,580
of keep introducing these they're just

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,729
going to kind of compound and compound

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,530
and compound them on each other so

00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:36,180
here's our line on the page put it in an

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,910
art gallery what happens if we do it

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,650
four times and it's just randomly gone

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,000
into an X here but it's kind of yeah

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,710
left right left right what happens if we

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,270
do it more than four times what happens

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,380
we do it more than that what times if we

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,360
do it more than that what happens if we

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,130
do it more than that this is generative

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,419
art this is something now that is going

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,729
to be different every single time that

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:56,160
you refresh the page and to me this

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,900
looks great this is a kind of oh I've

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
made something here in a sense it's

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,919
finished I've got a finished work I've

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,419
got a finished piece of some code that I

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,430
made that I'm gonna be able to draw on

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:08,400
in the past and I'm just drawing lines

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,410
and tiling right you can do it with a

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,400
vertical and horizontal lines and again

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,099
we're gonna get a totally different

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,199
creation here but again it kind of

00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:17,440
provides this weird like mathematical

00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,140
beauty that I that I really

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,480
enjoy so let's start adding some more

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,810
techniques to our tool belt displacement

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,390
is the second one so say we had these

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,730
horizontal lines on the page and each

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,620
horizontal line was a connection of

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,670
points and we're kind of drawing the

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,020
lines through those points so what

00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,520
happens if we start displacing those

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,130
points what if we move their x and y

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,350
coordinates around into into a jumble

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,150
and we'll take away the dots just to

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,860
give the example so we have some kind of

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,780
messed up lines on a page but in a sense

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,880
that is generative odd in a simple way

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,110
but we can start to add kind of logic to

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,700
these things and play with them we can

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,010
get more complex what if we said

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,440
although all the lines to the furthest

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,120
left and to the furthest bottom will

00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,830
start to distort more this is kind of

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,140
like a generative art piece you've used

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,000
your brain you've kind of used some some

00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,170
similar techniques but again we're just

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,340
drawing lines on the page we can get

00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,410
more and more complex with something

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,460
like this and it's a beauty and again

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,900
it's something I'm just going to keep

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,920
saying and over and over again I really

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,060
love this kind of stuff I really

00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,830
appreciate it

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,540
this is kind of a mimic of an end as

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,550
Hough I put a lot of a lot of references

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,430
to a lot of generate about us and I

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,169
include them all in the end so here we

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,650
have three things and all we're really

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:28,030
doing is lines displacement and tiling

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,350
so what happens you know what we've got

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,390
a line what is the next most complex

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,430
thing naturally it's a curve so what

00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,410
happens if we add curves in JavaScript

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,360
to a curve it's almost exactly the same

00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,919
you have a start and you have an end

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,350
position and then you have two control

00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:42,610
points and those are used to affect the

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,990
curve I actually felt this was really

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,750
fun to play with so I thought I'd make

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,840
an example that the top right there or

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,550
the top left for everybody and the other

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,590
side of the start and end point and then

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,480
the two other things are the other

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,520
control points and you can kind of watch

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,400
as that center line would draw the curve

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,990
in and and and this is cool because this

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,910
is how Bezier curves work it's like whoa

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,830
you know you can see the the

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,169
interpolation between between each of

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,060
the parts which I find super cool and

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:16,000
it's like oh man let's just add 800

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:18,220
points to this whoa fun-fun-fun

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,240
it's like oh there's those fuzzy curves

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,130
crazy right

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,870
so if we add curves to our page and we

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,940
go ah let's look back at our tiling

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,950
technique and we tile and we Thailand we

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,240
tile and we tile you don't even know

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,100
that that's what you're gonna get you

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,180
don't expect that coming through but

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,860
again it's gonna be different

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,419
time it's a nice little piece of art

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,330
it's a nice little piece of code it's a

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,250
nice little rap you know so we can add

00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,750
curves to our and as half example and

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,690
we're starting to get something have

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,490
developed a little bit more here and of

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,839
course you could put the put the

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,190
displacement in the middle and you could

00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,660
get something like that Joy Division

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,690
logo and it's going to be different

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,839
every single time so let's add something

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,149
else to our page to about repetition and

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,970
repetition in development is pretty much

00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,950
loops right so let's have a play with

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,470
those what if we draw our displace line

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,120
right across the page and what if we

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,620
displace it and draw it again but we

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,570
don't erase the previous version and

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,700
again and again and again and again and

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,810
again and again and again and again we

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,490
start to get some kind of patterns

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:19,630
emerging right what happens if we do it

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:22,209
thousands of times we get this kind of

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,010
weird natural kind of Harry Harry

00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:25,540
creation and you don't really expect

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,100
this again it's kind of a little bit of

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,440
surprise and delight in your own code

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,459
and every single time that you do this

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,680
you're going to get something different

00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:33,760
a different creation and it's always

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,700
going to be cool it's always going to be

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,959
different and that's repetition again we

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,490
can put that in our and as often now

00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:42,250
we've got some really complex stuff

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,750
going on here and again it's just

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,040
beautiful beautiful little creation so

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,080
now we've got eight things that we've

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,000
made with with our with our techniques

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,440
and you can kind of see what's happening

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,570
here and how it's kind of compounding on

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,220
itself so shapes let's add shapes we've

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,830
got lines curves naturally the next

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,839
thing is shapes and again in JavaScript

00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,490
there's rect and arced so you can do

00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,930
rectangles and squares and arcs or

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,790
circles but really you can draw any

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,290
shape you just have to move to each

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,130
coordinate of the shape and then say

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:11,020
stroke at the end so if we introduce our

00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:14,050
tiling example before and we kind of use

00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,339
a series of squares and triangles and

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,500
circles and stuff like that we're gonna

00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:18,700
get again super complex pieces I guess

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,690
you can kind of keep going deeper and

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,800
you're gonna get this kind of noise

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:26,380
effect we can get these squares and we

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,880
can start to apply our displacement in

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,890
our random variables so what happens if

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,970
we kind of randomly rotate squares that

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,140
are that are more towards the bottom

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,850
this is a again an example from 1977 or

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,770
something like that and what happens if

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,110
we displace those we've got this nice

00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,730
little piece of odd here it can be as

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,270
simple or it can be as complex as we

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,530
want but again it's

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,170
kind of code complete you've got

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,540
something you've created something we

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,010
can play with a suckle and we can do our

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,300
displacement again so there's our dots

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,460
and we can start to kind of mangle the

00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,050
circle around that's what it looks like

00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,550
and again we can just do it over and

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,160
over and over and over again and we're

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,290
gonna get this crazy like ring esque

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,970
thing form and it's just so much fun to

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,770
make this stuff it's so much it adds so

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,880
much joy to the code because you again

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,200
you're gonna get something different

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,470
every single time and it's gonna look

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,540
beautiful over and over and over again

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,700
so let's add recursion to our tool belt

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,960
we all know recursion from coding

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,960
interviews and that's pretty much it

00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,890
but for those who don't know in in

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,690
recursion you're calling a function

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,330
within itself and then you kind of have

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,280
an edge case which is there where it's

00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,590
like oh let's break out of the break out

00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,200
of the recursion so in this example I'm

00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,020
drawing a rectangle and then inside that

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,070
rect Kong ago I'm gonna draw another one

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,480
until it gets smaller and smaller and

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,250
smaller until it reaches a certain size

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,500
and then we can start adding in our

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,180
random variables again it can be it can

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,890
be less complex it can be more complex

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,140
we could tilt it in different directions

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,550
right and then we can go back to our

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,440
tool belt and say Oh what do we know how

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,270
to do oh we have tiling right so let's

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,310
tile that a bunch of times let's title

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,020
it a ton of times and again whoa

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,090
something done something really really

00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,010
nice you can kind of print it out you

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,510
can get these AXI drills which will draw

00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,490
it on a page they're beautiful creations

00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:11,450
this again is something from the early

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,640
days of computer art we can get a

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,290
triangle and we can recurse in that so

00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,000
if we draw three triangles and then go

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,250
another lady and another lady this is

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,900
the Pinsky's triangle which is a kind of

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:25,400
common occurrence in in recursion and

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,900
then we can add our displacement from

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,130
our tool belt we can start messing it

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,780
around drawing it again and again and

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,370
again we can draw it a ton of times

00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,020
we're gonna have again these same

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,360
effects these same little developments

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,760
just kind of going on and on and on and

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,290
on this is another one branching which

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,700
you wish you kind of see so it splits

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,710
into two branches and they go in a

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,260
random direction for branches and it

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,790
gets more and more complex as you go on

00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,950
and then we could use our tiling maybe

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,720
we could tile them around in a circle

00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,250
really complex with that and we're going

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,500
to have this kind of scary

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,390
Mordor eye thing going on

00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
so now look at what we've got like it's

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,720
just growing and growing and growing

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,780
it's so exciting and it's so fun to just

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,220
make this stuff let's add colors to r21

00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,040
oh my god how do we go this far without

00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,120
adding colors let's kind of dip into

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,830
colors a little bit

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,330
Deanna kind of talked about these things

00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:16,560
in in her talk in the earlier days

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,240
getting random colors is kind of

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,250
difficult you would guess oh we got an

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,660
our G and a B so let's just kind of

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,310
randomize those numbers but you kind of

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,400
noticed that we get some of these Genki

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,840
colors randomizing and

00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,310
computer-generated colors is really

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,290
really difficult I think that a lot of

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:35,040
generative artists do is they stick to

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,810
the HSL space so they can pick a

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,310
saturation and a lightness and then you

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,440
can rotate through the hue and at least

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,840
this way you kind of get similar colors

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,970
and it works well for gradients but

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,520
again the reality of it is that picking

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,900
colors is super complex and there's all

00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,520
these kind of techniques that people use

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,920
but even then it's not really perfect to

00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,630
the eye so a good trick is really to

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,240
just go on a website like Adobe colors

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,890
or color levers comb and just find some

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,300
nice palettes that people have kind of

00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,340
put together that you know gonna look

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,870
nice and so we can start adding colors

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,940
into our examples what if we add it into

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,530
our shapes like look at that it's

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,420
completely different from the black and

00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,760
white version it's completely completely

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,100
nice this is an example that I took from

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,440
a website rectangle world we're drawing

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,550
curved lines which are our pipes and we

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,560
can kind of get the more and more

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,150
complex and they kind of interweave with

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,500
each other but when we add color we

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,590
start to get these really nice little

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,150
creations and you can add like kind of

00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,320
random colors like this and a palette or

00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,360
you could do something like this which

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,770
is just like one straight red line you

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,390
start to add the colors and you start to

00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,670
get more complexity and more enjoyment

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:38,100
and you can create yeah 800 versions

00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,450
here's using our circle and we're just

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,370
kind of tiling it across the screen

00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,720
using repetition over and over and you

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,570
see it starts to create these kind of

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,880
silky these silky effects and we can add

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,080
different colors and we can add

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,270
different shapes and I don't know it's

00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,830
just the evolution of it and the beauty

00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,110
of it it's very kind of screen saver

00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:59,100
esque of course as well you see things

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,630
like that in screen savers we can go

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,250
with our recursion so here's an example

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,410
where I'm drawing a circle in a circle

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,510
and a circle in a circle what happens if

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,880
we draw two circles we start to get this

00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,230
kind of crazy shape if we draw

00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,540
three funnily enough the Pinsky's

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,340
triangle pops up again but you can see

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,990
the kind of complexity evolving in this

00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,970
and that really all we're doing is

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,010
drawing a circle if we draw four if we

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,390
draw five like wow you would never

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,190
expect something like that to pop out

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,900
six it starts to you start to lose a bit

00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,820
of definition around there but what if

00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,100
we had colors into that and we use

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,600
different shades of green again it's

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,570
like oh you start to get these crazy

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,670
kind of fractally patterns and you can

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,530
you know add a the generative aspect and

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,830
kind of be random with with variables

00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:42,680
and what you get out of things like that

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,610
super beautiful algorithms I'm and we're

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,770
starting to get a little bit more

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,120
complex here we all know that algorithms

00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,480
are the world programs use when they

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,880
don't want to explain what they did and

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,940
that's exactly what I'm gonna do so

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,940
Perlin noise is one that pops up a lot I

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,800
took this one from code pen I mean a

00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,110
reference at the end and a purlin noise

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,370
you create a field of vectors and

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,660
they're pointing in each direction and

00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,400
then you shoot something through those

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,750
vectors and they're influenced by the

00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,800
world around them Poland noise was

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:14,120
actually created for for animation to

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,680
mimic kind of real life examples and

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,390
when you put a pearl in noise and you

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,470
put a ton of particles you start to get

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,170
these really really beautiful

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,580
collections creations and it's all it's

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,510
all generative on every single time that

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,620
you refresh it you're gonna get

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,760
something new you're gonna get something

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,740
different

00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,630
you can run them slow you can run them

00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,370
fast a lot of people kind of pause these

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,530
because yeah they have an innate beauty

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,240
in their own put them in Asarco they

00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,950
look really nice printed on shirts and

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,210
things like that it's the kind of thing

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,950
that looks really really nice when you

00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,810
start to add color to it and you see

00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:45,950
this kind of slowly slowly evolved move

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:47,540
my mouse out of the way yeah the

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,800
complexity is just kind of hidden in

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:54,890
this red one might be a little bit more

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:57,500
a little bit more visible it's got this

00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,730
kind of wood s grain effect and you

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,550
could run it longer you can run it

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,900
shorter you know it's totally up to you

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,870
that's the fun so we can start to add

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,089
other inputs into this for example if we

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,740
took the Mona Lisa and we said let's

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,390
draw a grid across the screen and get

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,400
the colors out of each of those spots

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,170
and then draw a circle we're gonna get

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,610
this nice kind of minimal Mona Lisa

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,709
isn't that nice

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,900
you could use recursion into that and

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,520
georgiana

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,110
you're gonna get a different arty style

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,460
every time you refresh it's gonna be

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,740
different you can turn it into Lego

00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,080
blocks if you want and it still has a

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,610
beautiful style a beautiful feel it's

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,400
something that I feel proud to have made

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:35,170
you can add audio inputs and you know

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,240
send a message to somebody and save that

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,190
out and go hey we've got we've got some

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,720
more generative art here so now look at

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,250
everything we've made and you can just

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,740
see how these simple techniques the

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,030
lines the circles they they compound on

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,190
themselves and this is really just the

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,250
tip of the iceberg for generative art it

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:53,580
just goes on and on and on like this

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:56,110
there's so much to do and so much to add

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:59,740
there's a 3d space that you can enter

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:01,830
there's so much music that goes on that

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:05,110
has kind of generative aspects to it

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:07,440
yeah it just is a super super expensive

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:10,210
beautiful space so I want to get

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,500
retrospective for a little bit now that

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,710
I've kind of gone through this

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,240
techniques and look at what I was

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,070
discovering when I was doing this and

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,860
I'm running a workshop tomorrow at

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,930
decompress to create generative art with

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,080
people and it just gave me a nice look

00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:28,120
into again the tool belt and the idea

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,130
that when we're building things we have

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,870
small pieces like drawing a line and we

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,670
can put a line and a loop together and

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,740
we can create something infinitely

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,260
complex but you could also kind of do it

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,780
on pen and paper so I wanted to look at

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,490
the ways that we learn of course we use

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,770
things like tutorials we use things like

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:48,850
Stack Overflow we use things like ducks

00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:50,740
and these are great they're they're

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:53,410
really good at providing a small piece

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,270
of information that we can use and a lot

00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,400
of the time I find when when beginners

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,900
especially are looking at problems it's

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,910
easy to get a little bit confused with

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,550
what they're trying to do and what is

00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,550
the actual problem at hand we have

00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:08,740
things like code pen jsbin jsfiddle

00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,570
glitch is one of the new ones that that

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,090
provide us with a way to give examples

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,800
to each other and and through these

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:17,080
examples we can kind of add it through

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,120
and see what people have done we have

00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,060
awesome things

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,100
Suz here does twitch streaming of live

00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,260
coding there's websites like the coding

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,890
train and clever program at that are

00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:32,380
built to show new people new things but

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,360
again I guess the way that we look at

00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,190
learning and the way that we

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,710
at developing I was I was kind of hoping

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,030
to make something a little bit different

00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,049
so I started playing around with this

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,780
idea or something that I've called

00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:44,670
tutorial mock down and I'm using

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,440
generative odd as the examples but here

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,690
we've got a tutorial that you would see

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,299
in a kind of regular everyday site we've

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,070
got an iframe and we've got a small kind

00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,600
of code section at the top and what I

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,940
wanted to do is is create this

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,890
experience that lets you go at your own

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,360
pace but through the kind of medium of

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:02,640
tutorial I'm not like a video where you

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,110
have to pull it and go back so as you

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,580
scroll through this you're going to

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,380
start to see the code kind of riding

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,120
itself into the bottom into the top left

00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,950
and it's executing in the bottom right

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,390
so oh we're going to stop by drawing a

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,240
line in the tutorial we're going to

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,280
explain how a line works we're gonna add

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,620
a generative aspect down here so it

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,030
could be random every single time like

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,770
oh if you don't understand this you can

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,600
kind of go back to the the single line

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,640
and then we're going to start to add

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,980
more complexity and start drawing and

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,540
kind of go in and out and say oh you

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,400
know I want to I want to go back I want

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,440
to play with this you can kind of play

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,290
with it so this is something that I've

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,760
kind of been working on and the the

00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,679
style that I'm doing it is fairly simple

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,570
it's it's a markdown option have used

00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,299
the dock on the screen it's just regular

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,220
markdown and a few commands so tutorial

00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:50,520
markdown set up HTML tutorial markdown

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,020
set up styles and then when you're when

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,880
you're just writing the code again the

00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,100
same thing just like a tutorial markdown

00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,780
trigger and as we'll kind of go through

00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,820
this will generate into your markdown

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,679
and create these interactive tutorials I

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,179
don't have anything to release just yet

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,860
but kind of keep an eye on that space

00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,080
and if you're interested even remotely

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,179
in working on something like this with
