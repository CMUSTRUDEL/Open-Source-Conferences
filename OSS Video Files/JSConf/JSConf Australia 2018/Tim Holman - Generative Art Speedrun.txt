Title: Tim Holman - Generative Art Speedrun
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: JSConf Australia 2018
Description: 
	For so many of us, myself included, the art world is the entry point into the coding world. Here we will explore ins and outs of generative art, and experience the joy of creating art with code. Generative art can be as simple or complex as you like, at the end of the day, everyone will have the mindset and processes down to create their own unique pieces of joy.

This talk begins with the basics of generative art, a small history, including some of the earliest "code art", proceeding into examples through history leading us here. The goal of the "speed run" is to give the audience as much knowledge about generative art as possible in the given time, while also showing the tooling, and surprisingly few steps it takes to get creating unique and original art. Generally speaking, there is no limitation to the audience of this talk, it really sits on the borderlines of people who enjoy art, code and science, and everyone will take home a different piece of that puzzle.

The talk shows both the simplicity and beauty of generative art, with just a few lines of code, we can put the computer to work creating millions of unique pieces.
