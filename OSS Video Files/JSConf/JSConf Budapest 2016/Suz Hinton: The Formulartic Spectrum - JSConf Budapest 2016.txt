Title: Suz Hinton: The Formulartic Spectrum - JSConf Budapest 2016
Publication date: 2016-06-14
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2016
Description: 
	The physical world is just another binary machine. Data creation, analysis, and corruption combined with JavaScript can make new and unexpected things.

Can you programmatically extract joy from the subjectivity it exists in? Can it be translated into intentional forms to hook others in? This session will gently take you along on a personal journey of how you can use code to expose new expressions of the mundane secrets we hold dear.

good morning everyone welcome to The

00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:19,660
Hangover slot I promise I'll go easy on

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,730
all of you my name is Suze Hinton you

00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,950
can follow me on Twitter and github at

00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,660
new cat if you want to know what my

00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,759
username means you can come and find me

00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,130
after this I'm a front-end developer at

00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:32,800
Kickstarter in New York City which we'll

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,630
be talking about a little later on I'm

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,120
also a member of the node.js Hardware

00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,380
working group so really enjoyed Rachel's

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,060
talk yesterday she was talking about the

00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:44,079
no BOTS community so we're both part of

00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,670
that ok we both also like cuts a lot

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,390
which you'll also find out with this

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,489
talk I'm recently a member of the newly

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,980
minted amber accessibility project

00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,769
community team should we work on trying

00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,269
to bring better accessibility to the mas

00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:59,219
front-end framework so again talk to me

00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:02,920
if you'd like to know more about that

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,360
we're actively working on that so why

00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,830
are we here you're probably reading the

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,360
abstract and wondering about that we're

00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,680
going to try and keep things in mystery

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,590
for a little bit longer but the main

00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,900
points are that today we're talking

00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,450
about Dada and art and how they can fit

00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,490
together we're also talking about making

00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,020
a mess I think it's really important to

00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,900
make a mess and I'll touch on that a

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,700
little later on - there's also a lot of

00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,439
feelings so if anyone's seen my talks

00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,700
before you know that this is coming but

00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,619
I thought I would have a warning that

00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,640
there are a lot of feelings in this but

00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:37,659
it's a good thing to story time I want

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,520
to tell you a little story in 1994 I was

00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:45,729
9 years old and I was reading the

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:48,880
following book this was my introduction

00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:51,159
to programming and you're thinking 1994

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,710
pretty strongly Windows 95 is about to

00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,320
come out but this was my computer so I

00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,149
was really really excited to learn how

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,969
to make art on the computer I'd been

00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:02,680
drawing like my entire life and I never

00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:04,450
really got that great at it but as a kid

00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,250
that's all I wanted to do with computers

00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,350
was I didn't want to type on them I

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,509
wanted to make art so I was reading this

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,210
book and this was my introduction to

00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:14,920
programming and so I guess you could

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,010
call that you could call me the littlest

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,310
artist at the time but of course I did

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,230
grow up and I still was in love with the

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,739
idea of sort of the primitive

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,930
things that go on behind graphics and so

00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:33,220
recently I wrote a library called Olli

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:35,830
DJ s and its job is to put pitches on

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,510
this primitive screen so you can kind of

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,980
see how that influence is still carried

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,790
through I'm not going to tell you how

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,680
many years later and give away my age so

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,349
I think of myself as the accidental

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,750
programa I didn't realize I was going to

00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:51,250
be a professional programmer when I was

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,470
nine years old I was just having a lot

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,630
of fun and so in my personal time I

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,489
still like to emphasize on that which is

00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,860
why I call myself the accidental

00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,810
programmer I don't care about whether

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,640
you use semicolons in your code or not

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:09,130
it just it doesn't matter to me that's

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:10,599
not what excites me about programming so

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,620
now I'm going to tell you a story within

00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:17,319
a story I had a good friend Lindsay

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,269
Smith give me this book and he said to

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,410
me I think you'll really like it and I

00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:22,959
think this was about seven or eight

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:26,049
years ago so for those who haven't read

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:30,010
it it's called contact by Carl Sagan by

00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:32,620
this lovely gentleman here and the main

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,109
character is a scientist called dr.

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,549
Ellie Arroway and she works for the SETI

00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:39,340
movement trying to find extraterrestrial

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:42,670
life so she heads up the program at what

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,549
if the astronomy towers and so her job

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,739
is to scan all of the signals in the sky

00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:49,930
and figure out whether or not that's an

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,540
extraterrestrial signal she has to dig

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,970
within the noise and try and find that

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,420
signal in there and she actually does

00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:01,600
one day and her team finds a message

00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,209
from outer space and so this ends up

00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,829
taking her to New York City where she

00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,930
has to attend a lot of like really big

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,910
meetings with the government and with

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,310
security agencies and and with

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,569
scientists all over the world and it was

00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,359
the first time she'd been to New York

00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:17,620
City and she fell in love with it and

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,209
when I read this book initially I was in

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,639
Australia and when I moved to New York

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,300
City I felt the same way and I almost

00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:28,090
carried her in my heart while I did and

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,340
so she had to take the subway in order

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,500
to get to a lot of her meetings and it

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,350
turned out that as she's riding the

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,210
subway because her mind was so true

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,350
over the last few months - listening for

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:43,420
signals within the noise that as she was

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,980
on the train she ended up missing all of

00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,220
her meetings because she was listening

00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,690
so intently for secret messages that she

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,400
didn't realize you know what was real

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,070
and what wasn't anymore

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,780
and so I found myself when I first

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,690
started taking the subway trying to

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,240
listen for messages in that - but then I

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,730
realized something about the difference

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:08,230
between myself and dr. Ally are awake

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:11,580
and that is that I kind of look for this

00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:15,300
sort of stuff - which is how is similar

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,740
but dr. Arroway didn't have JavaScript

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,500
so what if dr. Arroway did have

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,400
JavaScript you know how could she try

00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,780
and visualize the hidden messages in the

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,910
sort of noises that she falls in love

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:33,640
with so I found myself asking what does

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,470
sound look like and you know how can we

00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,210
visualize that so we saw some of that

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,280
last night where the sounds were

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,930
visualized long like the the frequency

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,470
samples I'm gonna do something slightly

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:47,470
different today and we're gonna find out

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,390
via art what sound can be made to look

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:53,800
like so we're gonna use the Web Audio

00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:55,270
API and before I go into this you're

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,700
probably wondering what the formulaic

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:01,780
spectrum is well that's a made-up word

00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:03,940
so I'll explain so when you work with

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,550
data especially in your professional job

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,770
you want to make sure that that the

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,930
integrity of that data is is accurate

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,900
and the way that you're presenting that

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,360
data is also super accurate and so when

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,940
you're creating art be loyal to that the

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,730
data is really important in order to

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:24,010
create beauty that people can still

00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,450
relate back to the data right so that's

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,490
really really important

00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,650
when you start getting on the data

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,660
corruption side things start to get

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:36,010
messy there's a slight disconnect and

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,260
you're not really sure what's going on

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,780
but the thing is like that's art - like

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,640
who cares it's it's not it's not

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,990
important because you start with

00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,320
something and you come up with something

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,000
unexpected at the other end so the talk

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,220
today is sort of focusing more

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,270
it's this messy side just to give you a

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:57,070
bit of an indication so the way that I

00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,140
wanted to use the Web Audio API was I

00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,570
wanted to record samples of the subway

00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:04,630
and then I wanted to analyze that PCM

00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:08,160
data so what is PCM it stands for pulse

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:10,870
code modulation so it's actually the raw

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,030
uncompressed audio data so it's the

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,700
samples that have been taken from the

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:19,780
analog world and then digitized so each

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:22,120
value in like a PCM file the the sample

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,830
ranges from negative 1 to positive 1 in

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,120
value so that's really important cuz

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,780
we're sort of going to map to that later

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:33,610
and some common PCM format file

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:38,260
extensions WAV files a files a ul 16 and

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:41,290
of course start PCM and this is a rather

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,720
wonky photo I took from Wikipedia that

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,850
sort of shows how you have your analog

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,460
sine waves and then you do math to

00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,620
figure out like how to actually sample

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,850
that at regulate intervals so they're

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,990
the sort of values that we'll be playing

00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:57,700
with now I end a lot of time sort of

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,100
secretly trying to record sounds on the

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,960
subway and I decided to pick a really

00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,280
annoying obnoxious sound that we've all

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,990
sort of learned to ignore so if you've

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,970
never been on the New York City subway

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,620
before you may not be familiar with this

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,130
so I'll play it for you those who have

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:15,840
will be very annoyingly aware of it

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,840
stand clear of the closing doors please

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:24,090
and that dingdong at the end every time

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,130
okay so what if we took this sounds

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,009
right what if we took it as a WAV file

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,509
and open debt and looked at the data and

00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:33,360
what if we took all of those values from

00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:36,120
negative one to positive one and we said

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,490
okay each sample is a pixel on our

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,130
screen and then what if we took that

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,289
range and just mapped it over so it

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,850
would be zero to 255 to make it easier

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,200
for us to work with right negative one

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,360
to positive one is a really weird range

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,089
to work with unless you're working with

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,740
random numbers and what if that new

00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,080
value that we've mapped it to would

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:59,160
affect the hue of the pixel that we're

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,690
putting on the page so I won't freak you

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,980
all out with too much code this morning

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,250
given that we were all drinking the

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,930
night before but it takes you know 12 to

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,020
13 lines of code in order to achieve

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,580
this a lot of art is just a bunch of for

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,339
loops and I was telling someone this

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,230
last night you're just taking data and

00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,020
then looping around and doing crazy

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,150
things with it within the loop so we use

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:25,339
the audio context to decode the audio

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:28,290
data and we're just feeding in like

00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,700
what's a coda and array buffer and then

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,040
once we've decoded that within the

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,690
promise we can get one of the channels

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,250
so we're just getting the left ear

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,110
because it's art it doesn't matter for

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:41,580
dropping the right ear we loop through

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:45,480
that and once we've mapped the value

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:48,450
from 2 to from 0 to 255 we can then

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,480
generate a pixel out of it by generating

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:54,589
a hue saturation luminosity converting

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,490
it to RGB and then we can manipulate a

00:09:54,589 --> 00:10:01,350
image data canvas object and then put

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,720
that back onto the canvas in that very

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,130
last line so these slides will be up

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,260
online later so you can have a look at

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,709
that more closely if you like so what

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:13,500
does it look like if we just do this

00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:14,910
well this is sort of what we have and so

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,990
that comes out really interesting I

00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,740
actually thought it was really beautiful

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:21,029
and so there's a lot of pixels in there

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,529
but you can sort of see this rainbow

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:23,310
banding effect which i think is really

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,029
really cool

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:28,589
and if you're so if you've really been

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,360
paying attention this photo in the last

00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:30,740
10 seconds you

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,480
realize that you can actually see the

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,000
patterns of the sound and this really

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,800
delighted me a lot you can actually make

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,420
out the individual words through those

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,910
bands at the top so you can actually

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,300
figure out based on how big the bands

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,160
are which word and syllable the speaker

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,500
was saying then you can see this big

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,360
empty bit but that's the white noise and

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,399
then they very obnoxious dingdong at the

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,130
end is in like vibrant rainbow colors

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,470
and I thought this was actually really

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,480
cool like this was proof that the the

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,370
dotted integrity is like one for one you

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,980
can actually see it and so that's really

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,620
cool to verify that that you know you've

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,269
brought that in and visualized it

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,620
there's only one problem with that that

00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:12,290
picture that you just looked at is

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,029
300,000 pixels and a couple of times I

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,680
got the code wrong and I just completely

00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:17,959
crashed the browser because it got stuck

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,610
trying to work on something you can't

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:23,269
console.log within that loop or it will

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:26,510
freeze for example and when you think

00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:28,700
about it I just got the one channel I

00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,890
didn't get the other ear so imagine if

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,870
you had that would be 600,000 so it's

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:36,890
it's just it's a lot to work with and

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,240
it's a little bit scary so this is this

00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,839
is a bit of a problem like how do we

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,360
sort of like reduce that I thought maybe

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,420
the best way that to reduce that is to

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,070
map it audio to visuals and then back

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,510
out to audio again what if we can make

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:55,040
different audio out of this so what if

00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,730
we took the simple concepts of a song

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,100
right it's 16 beats so how do we sort of

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,360
divide that up well theoretically we

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,860
could take the three hundred and eight

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,839
thousand seven hundred and twenty eight

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,820
samples and we could divide that by

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,560
sixteen beats right so now we have our

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,839
chunks of samples to do something with

00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,019
but that's still a lot of samples that's

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,399
19 thousand samples so what if we sort

00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:18,440
of start getting real with the data

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,630
corruption and start losing data and

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,779
what if we average the sample values of

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,600
each beat so essentially we add all of

00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:29,390
them together divide it by 19,000 and

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,550
then we end up with a negative 1 to

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,320
positive 1 range like value for every

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,779
single beat then we can take that value

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,459
and do something sort of meaningful with

00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:41,930
it but it's it's a lot simpler to work

00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:43,120
with so what if we wanted to put people

00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:46,130
back on the train

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,100
we might be able to designate the seat

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:52,430
color of each feet based on the value

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:55,040
and maybe that seat color denotes what

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:58,339
drumbeats or what oscillator note we're

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,769
gonna play and then this little kitty at

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:02,690
the bottom what if if he was sitting on

00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:04,510
a seat that was you know designated by a

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,160
specific value as well within that range

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:10,510
what if he could do a guitar strum and a

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,510
note to sort of accompany that

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,550
so what we get is something like this so

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,230
there are eight seats on the left and

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,290
eight seats on the right so that makes

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,480
up sixteen beats and you can see here

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,610
the cat has appeared in in this sort of

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,149
pattern now this is taking the direct

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,800
data from the the PCM values again from

00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:33,139
that stand clear of the closing doors

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,730
please sound so without further ado

00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:36,850
let's have a listen to what that sounds

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,850
like

00:13:53,230 --> 00:14:05,810
okay so you get the point not sure

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:08,360
whether that's thank you so that's very

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:10,160
strange music and I sort of thought what

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,940
if we could make this a little more

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,400
entertaining so I have a friend and his

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,870
name is Mark Johnson and you can tell he

00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,870
lives in New York just by looking at him

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:24,110
partly and he's a very incredibly

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:26,810
talented designer and he's also just a

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,580
really funny guy so I I met up with him

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,440
in the cafe a couple of weeks ago and I

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,570
said you don't happen to have any silly

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,940
sample sounds that you've recorded of

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,830
your own voice to you and without

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,600
surprise I said actually I do and he

00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,180
just dropped boxed me a bunch of samples

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,740
so what happens if we put mark into this

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,720
train you know what is this gonna sound

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,720
like let's let's have a listen

00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:12,029
anyway that's sort of a little bit

00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:14,149
funnier and he we hasn't seen this yet

00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:16,740
so I guess I'll just send him this video

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:18,690
okay so a little bit about how I put

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,149
this piece of art together

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,670
most of it is SVG images that I've drawn

00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:26,399
in a different program and imported them

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,079
in just as image tags it's a lot of divs

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,630
so those seats are just floating divs

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,910
next to each other right so this this

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,769
sort of application is way easy to deal

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,350
with in canvas in my last example

00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:38,970
because you're just working with CSS and

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,860
you're working with JavaScript

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,589
manipulating those Dom elements so I

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,480
highly recommend doing art with divs and

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:46,680
things like that because you probably

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,060
couldn't tell by looking at it that it

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,610
was just straight markup that you can

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:53,370
look at in in the chrome developer tools

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,680
and then I'm using CSS animations for

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:59,160
that cursor to move across and I'm also

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,910
doing CSS animations the the cats kind

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,920
of danced along with this drama as well

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:08,639
and yeah obviously I'm not a musician

00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,620
because that didn't sound great but I'm

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,000
hoping to sort of improve this music and

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,319
I've been talking to some of my musical

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,019
colleagues and they've been helping me

00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:17,639
out but I'm better at Hardware things

00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,850
and I think I'm better than earn for

00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,589
that so I thought okay what would

00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,079
playing this music look like in the real

00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:27,810
world like can I do something to do with

00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,339
hardware that can transfer this really

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:31,019
weird composition in the browser and

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,300
then we can play it back out in the real

00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,350
world again

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,779
so I attend this meet up in New York

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,639
City code JavaScript as a code Brooklyn

00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:41,880
Deus and they have this really funny

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,500
riff on the MTA metro card that you use

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,870
in the train system so it just says

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,759
brooklyn javascript this is what the

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,350
actual card looks like so you can see

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,569
it's actually really clever and that's

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,959
how ticket to get in and it's also our

00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:56,870
drink ticket to get a free drink or you

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,370
can keep it and you have a souvenir and

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,040
i thought to myself that's that's such a

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:05,370
clever like riff to do on it like could

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,930
i do my own riff so i decided to lay out

00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,270
a custom printed

00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,650
afford and I thought what if I put a

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,600
speaker on the circuit board and then we

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,580
can play the sound but making it look

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,230
like a metric HUD so what it makes it

00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,820
obvious what sort of sounds it's going

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:24,390
to play in the first place so that's the

00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:26,280
tie back so this is what it looks like I

00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,570
I think if they turn the video on I

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,610
actually have it here so if you wanted

00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:35,310
to come and find me later on that's

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:38,160
that's it there with the giant this is

00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,960
like a little 3d printed house for a

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,890
speaker that I stole from a musical

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,840
greeting card and you can program the

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,730
chip on the board as well using the

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,160
headers in the corner here and it just

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,810
plays music off an SD card so if you can

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,550
put that composition on an SD card it

00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,850
will work and I think it'll be a little

00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:59,090
too quiet for me too I don't think you

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,530
can hear it but come and find me later

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,700
so here's a quick video of me testing it

00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,450
out for the first time after it's

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,450
soldered it all together

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:15,559
I don't think you can hear it I'm sorry

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:17,090
the audio is gone but you hold the

00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,400
button down and it plays the sound while

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,160
the the button is held down so this is

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,300
also using an 80 mega 328p so you've if

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,090
you've ever played with an Arduino

00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:28,580
before I actually just like rips the

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,230
micro micro controller off the Arduino

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,340
and then just put my own custom code on

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:36,800
it so so you know this isn't quite

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,720
finished yet and I feel like there's not

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,910
enough JavaScript in it for for me to

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,340
say it's a JavaScript project so I

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,830
actually wrote something last year code

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,140
a viago which uses nodejs to flesh

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,300
compiled programs onto micro electronics

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,760
so I've actually already done that so I

00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,710
did write the program that runs on this

00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,960
in C++ but it uses JavaScript to flash

00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,000
it on there so that's pretty cool the

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,330
next thing I want to do is to stream the

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,090
resulting song over USB connection with

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,860
node.js using WebSockets and it will

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,750
stream it over to the SD card and save

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,190
it as a file so I started working on

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,900
that a couple of nights ago during the

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,610
conference and I'm sort of almost there

00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,710
but I have some weird SPI bottleneck

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:18,559
issues so I will blog about that soon if

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,720
I manage to get it up and going and of

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,850
course I I want to make better music you

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:28,130
know not very good at it but we'll

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:31,940
figure it out okay so things got a

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:33,920
little bit weird but you know it's ah

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,809
this is the point this is this is what

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,090
I'm trying to tell you you don't always

00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:40,190
have to use your code for professional

00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,110
use you know when I work on my job

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,910
everyday I want my code to look perfect

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,610
I wanted to be readable I wanted to be

00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,530
performant but whenever I go home for

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,240
the day I almost want to rebel against

00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:53,150
that and and be the little girl with the

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,550
Commodore 64 again and so this is why

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,530
I'm up here today because I want to go

00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:00,920
over like what what was the point of

00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,929
this so creative coding gets you out of

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,540
your comfort zone when you're not used

00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:07,880
to using divs for things like music and

00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,220
moving curses and and things like that

00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,840
it teaches you how to think about the

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,880
tools you use everyday in a different

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,580
way and how you can sort of exploit that

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,080
kind of thing

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,809
art doesn't care about your semicolon

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,840
feelings so if you create really messy

00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:25,850
code with unused variables

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,670
you know missing stuff all over the

00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:31,130
place and and lots of repeated sort of

00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:33,200
copied and pasted functions odd doesn't

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,690
care it's still going to show you what

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,910
you wanted to look at in the end and so

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:40,340
you can really have a play ignore the

00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:43,010
actual code and just expressively start

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:48,130
writing because odd doesn't care about

00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:52,580
perfection it's it's about exploration

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:54,140
so kill MC or Killian McMahon is a he's

00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,590
a colleague and very close friend of

00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,540
mine and one day during a hackathon at

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,430
work I said ki just teach me about music

00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,560
and so this is him attempting to teach

00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:07,460
me about chords like G major and C major

00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,750
and he also told me about like staying

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,670
within those chords and creating really

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,140
cool sort of repeated loops so I'm

00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,030
really hoping to apply that new

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,580
knowledge to this music and help it

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,900
evolve but I've never worked with

00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,090
Killian in this way before

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,740
he's a designer and he writes the HTML

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,200
and CSS and then I write the JavaScript

00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,480
that accompanies his work and that's how

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,610
we normally collaborate but this offered

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,180
this new sort of collaboration given

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:33,830
that he plays amazing music outside of

00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:36,020
outside of work and if anyone's going to

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,790
Pike on this year in Portland he's

00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,370
actually going to be opening and putting

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:42,670
in a band playing and it's a really

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,390
awesome band they called The Adventure

00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,190
where they called the venture

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,300
capitalists and they make fun of the

00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,900
startup scene and they're really really

00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,490
cool so definitely check the route so I

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,580
guess what I'm saying is that odd is

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,840
about what you learned it's not about

00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,550
it's not about the normal things that

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,630
that we care about when we talk about

00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:04,190
syntax so take some time if you have the

00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,980
privilege of spare time and write some

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,310
messy code and make lots of mistakes and

00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,900
don't necessarily go back and fix them

00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,640
you deserve a break from being judged

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,990
we're always riding on each other's code

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,210
reviews and we're always like

00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,060
painstakingly going over line by line of

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,830
code but what if you could just type

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,870
like this you know it just it feels

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,040
soothing it feels expressive you're just

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,220
throwing stuff out there to see what

00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,750
happens I had no idea that a train with

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,130
cat sitting on it playing guitars it was

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,650
going to come out of this project but

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,510
that's that's what happened so code like

00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,970
no one's watching

00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:44,120
I want you to remember that code like no

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:47,510
one's watching and if you can don't get

00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,130
rebase before you push it up so I'm

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,150
starting to see an alarming problem in

00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,280
our industry we're juniors look up to

00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:58,640
programmers who are mid-level and senior

00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,260
and lead and they see us writing this

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,180
perfect code out of the gate because

00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,750
they see it after we've opened the pull

00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,370
request

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,600
well they join a company and they look

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,530
at our finished code that's already

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,050
sitting in production and I see juniors

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,480
even in my job just frozen looking at

00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:17,060
this empty text file when they starting

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,100
a feature and it's it's that fear of the

00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,720
blank canvas they think that they have

00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,280
to write everything perfectly and have

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,560
all the details in their head the first

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,480
time and that's just not true

00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,300
that's not how any of us write I don't

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,160
think we write something sort of good

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,500
and then we write it Gouda and then we

00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,200
write it the goodest right that's that's

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,210
how it works and having to explain that

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,860
and having to get those genius to come

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,680
and pay with me whenever I've started

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,450
something so they can see my process

00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,130
that shouldn't be necessary we we should

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,810
be showing people history even an

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,580
hour.get so they can see that we wrote

00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,130
something messy and then we went back

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,110
and we thought about it and and we

00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,900
changed it in ways that we wouldn't have

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,000
seen when we first started so just get

00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,730
push and the scariest thing I've ever

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,530
done last night was I pushed all of the

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:06,110
art that I showed you today I pushed it

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,850
all up to github and I left it learn you

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,110
know there's multiple audio contexts

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,790
going on and they all have slightly

00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,950
different ways of naming the variables

00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,360
and it's a complete mess but I'm

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,790
inviting you to look at it so you can

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,100
see how stuff evolved and it doesn't

00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:21,050
matter because all I wanted people to

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,720
see was the final product and it works

00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,640
perfectly fine so think about that in

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,710
your everyday so that we can all be

00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,080
learning more of each other and not

00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:33,380
being so terrified of having to be

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:37,820
perfect the first time so that we can

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:40,310
make it okay for others so if you take

00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,800
anything away today I want you to make

00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,960
some art and want you to just throw it

00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,510
away if you don't like it because it's

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,910
just code you can write more

00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,680
so if you'd like to have a look at my

00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:56,490
art examples you can go to that address

00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,600
and the repo will also go there so that

00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:02,040
you can have a look at the code if you

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:05,310
like il TSW just stands for I love the

00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,990
subway that's my secret I I ride the

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:09,750
subway even when I'm not going anywhere

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,430
sometimes because I love it so I was

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,460
trying to make everyone else love this

00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:15,780
subway today and if you'd like to go

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,190
through my slides again so look at some

00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,670
of the code samples or just like play

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:23,280
with the stuff that I showed you can go

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,200
to again new cut github today you

00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,030
slashed formulaic spectrum I just got a

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,060
jackal build error in my email so I will

00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,170
try and fix it it's not quite up yet and

00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,390
I will be blogging about this project
