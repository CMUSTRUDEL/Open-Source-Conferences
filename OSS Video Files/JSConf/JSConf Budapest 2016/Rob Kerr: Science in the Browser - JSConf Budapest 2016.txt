Description: 
	Science in the Browser: Orchestrating and Visualising Neural Simulations

Open-science is about making scientific research accessible to everyone, from other scientists to the general public, but often that means just dumping data sets and publishing the researchers' interpretations. To truly communicate findings and ignite collaboration, we need to expose the tools that the scientists used to analyse the data, simulate the mathematical models, and visualise the results. As a neuroscientist and a web developer, this is something I've been working towards.

My talk will show how the old-school, computationally-heavy software used in science can be set free using the centralized power of cloud resources and the ubiquity of the browser. We'll see real-time, publicly-broadcast, simulations of the electrical activity in brain cells, visualised in 3D using Javascript.

so good afternoon everyone I'm really

00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,140
excited to be here talking to you today

00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:19,090
my name is rob kerr i'm from IBM

00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:25,090
research and I've come all the way from

00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:26,080
Melbourne Australia so as it says up

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,750
there I'm going to talk to you about

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,859
science in the browser today I'm going

00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,310
to talk to you about how I use a web

00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:34,930
browser to orchestrate and visualize

00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,870
simulations of neurons which are brain

00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,280
cells but more generally I'm going to

00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,400
speak to you about my experiences

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,640
working at the intersection of science

00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,130
and web development but before I get to

00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,030
that and if this will still work I'm

00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:54,040
going to tell you to origin stories and

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:58,240
like all good origin stories these

00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,920
involves science so the first of these I

00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,290
think a lot of you'll probably be

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,379
familiar with and that is the birth of

00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:09,420
the web so the web was created back in

00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:13,240
the 1980s to help scientists do science

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,000
was created by that's the science lab

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,920
was created by tim berners-lee at CERN

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and it was created to to solve a problem

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,460
particle physicists from around the

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,230
world needed better ways to access and

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,940
share the data that they collected while

00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,080
they're out soon as Tim sort of put it

00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,760
the data collected from different

00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,110
experiments would be stored on different

00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,810
computers you'd have to log onto these

00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,340
computers manually you'd often have to

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,100
learn a new program or programming

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,409
language to get at the data and so he

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,060
saw the web as a way to simplify this to

00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,729
make it easy to access and share the

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:52,450
data between like within the community

00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:54,430
and shortly after this the web spun out

00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:59,560
of the scientific community to become

00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:02,740
what it is today oops so the second

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,600
origin story guess this isn't working

00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,330
quite like he expected the second origin

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,310
story that i'd like to tell you is one

00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,260
that i think very few over you feel

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,310
familiar with that's the story of how I

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,310
came to be speaking to you today

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,430
so like most of you sorry like many of

00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:24,340
you here I've come to the web from

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:26,329
somewhere else my background is in

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,099
neuroscience it's in developing

00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:29,450
mathematical models to try and

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:32,209
understand different parts of the brain

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,040
and how they work this was something I

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:38,090
was so interested in fact I decided to

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,890
do a PhD in it and PhD specialties are

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,250
difficult it's not because you have to

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,829
be super smart that that does help but

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,720
it's because you have to work by

00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:50,599
yourself on a single project for years

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,609
and years no one else really knows what

00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,049
you're doing ultimately no one else

00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:57,260
really cares if it's successful it's

00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:59,079
your project and because of this the end

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:04,549
of a PhD is a time of stress

00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:06,459
disillusionment and procrastination now

00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:08,959
I didn't make a jacket out of receipts

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:13,040
instead what I did I taught myself Ruby

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,560
on Rails and as a sort of a project to

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,549
help with this something to build I

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,900
built a rhyming dictionary which I felt

00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:24,409
wrong I built a rhyming dictionary

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,299
called any rom-com which is online if

00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:28,010
you want to check it out and so I used

00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:31,040
Ruby on Rails to build the backend for

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:33,709
it and then I decided I wanted sort of a

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,840
visual interface so the users could not

00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,159
just do a normal sort of rain but they

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,459
could like match different parts of the

00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:44,629
word and even do portman toes and that

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:47,299
sort of thing so i told myself a bit of

00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:49,639
angular to build something and i found

00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:50,810
myself really enjoying this I'm not just

00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,229
because i had a thesis i didn't want to

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,959
write I found it really satisfying to

00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:58,129
use code to construct something visual

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,019
something you could see and something

00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,519
that people could interact with I think

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:06,290
that probably resonates with the follow

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,150
of you here but eventually I handed in

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,629
my thesis and got a job with IBM

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,720
Research to continue doing euro science

00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:16,070
but now I'd had this taste for what web

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,220
could do I knew about this whole other

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,580
world of stuff and perhaps that could

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,729
help with my research but before I get

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,050
into that I'm going to give you a bit of

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,310
context and a bit more of an

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,020
understanding of what research it is

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:36,760
that I do

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:36,760
so this is going to work at all oh well

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:51,050
yeah place it's a really good transition

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:58,690
so I'm going to do it for the

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:58,690
transitions right yep

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,949
okay oh we're not Marin okay that's good

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,240
now we've got we've recreated the

00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,479
failure and you leave that open because

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,810
I'm going to need to me later yeah it's

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:23,120
going to be fine so this is the other

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:25,680
monitor and so now if I click this and

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,740
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,740
wait

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,260
it's going to be good

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:50,060
gosh right right right right right Leigh

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:53,170
from current slide is that it it's a

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,170
wide slot that's what I wanted

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:08,970
well this is excellent because you're

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:10,860
really going to like this transition so

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,220
this is a plastic model of the human

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,470
brain it represents a hunk of meat that

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,510
sits in our heads and is responsible for

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,420
all our memories and motions and

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,330
decisions it gives us our sense of self

00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,980
and our ability to comprehend the world

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,740
it allows us to learn to move and to

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,210
speak information from our senses such

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,390
as our eyes our ears and our fingertips

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,070
is all sent to the brain to be

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,890
remembered to be understood and

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,870
potentially lead to actions yet how the

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:43,230
brain accomplishes all of this is still

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:45,650
largely a mystery and finding out is one

00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,060
of the fundamental goals of neuroscience

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,710
one thing we do know however is the

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,560
brain is made up of an enormous network

00:06:49,710 --> 00:07:02,190
of neurons of cells called neurons ready

00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:04,340
for it so the human brain contains

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:07,020
approximately 86 billion neurons and

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,750
each of these makes 10,000 connections

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,030
with other cells in the brain it is this

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,770
large dense network of cells that

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,950
scientists believe give rise to all of

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,810
these abilities that I just mentioned

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:22,080
but let's zoom in now through some

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,970
individual neurons what we see is that

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,310
these all have a common structure they

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,750
have a cell body called the soma they

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,910
have incoming fibers called dendrites

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,270
and have an outgoing fiber called an

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,560
axon this axon end branches and it forms

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:40,530
connections onto the dendrites of other

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,900
neurons yet despite this basic common

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,610
structure there is a large variety of

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,400
different neuron morphologies found

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,580
throughout the brain so here are some

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,500
examples and examples of even more of

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,950
these can be found online ok so now

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,950
going to mirror

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:09,440
at a website called neuromorphic org you

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,150
guys can say that yes so this is an

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,220
online database of neuron morphologies

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,590
and that have been uploaded by

00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,990
experimentalists so what happens is

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,600
experimentalists get fluorescent dye and

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,490
they inject the eject the dye into the

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,470
neuron cells so that they stand out from

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,940
the other neurons they then take a

00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,000
series of microscope images at different

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,830
depths and they then get these images

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,360
and they painstakingly know they get

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,700
their students to painstakingly trace

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,510
through these images in order to

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,610
recreate the full 3d morphology now here

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,510
we see some images of these sort of

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,470
morphology so these are static 2d images

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,540
so they give you an idea of what the

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,960
morphology looks like but what they

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,300
actually look like is this they're

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,220
actually text files so each row in this

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,370
text file corresponds to a point on the

00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:01,880
neuron the first the first done column

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:04,400
is the ID each row then has a type so

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,410
milord end Raider axon has XYZ

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,410
coordinates and as a radius telling you

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,780
how thick the fibers at that point and

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:15,260
then starting from the cell body which

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,760
is negative 1 they all have the parent

00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,230
point the idea of the parent point and

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,650
in this way it construct sort of the

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,390
tree that is in your arm now very often

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,080
in science having a good way to

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,700
visualize your data is is key this is a

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,590
prime example because just looking at

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,380
this file we can't see what's going on

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,090
we can't see what this neuron looks like

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,910
so what I decided to do was to build

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:41,210
build a simple tool to to visualize this

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,410
morphology and existing tools were

00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,050
already out there that's how they made

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,650
those images but I wanted to learn three

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:51,140
jazz and I also I wanted something sort

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:53,480
of simple in and easy to use that I

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:58,990
could extend how I want it so i'll just

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,990
show you a demo of that now so this is

00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,330
let's make it a bit figure so you can

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,870
see so here i can upload that file we

00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,870
were just looking up

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,740
and we can see it loads here it's a bit

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,470
small but now we can we can rotate and

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,600
zoom in and see the full 3d morphology

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,459
so here we've got the blue and purple

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,889
fibers at the dendrites so the incoming

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:25,600
fibers the cell body is sort of just a

00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,940
point and then in white we've got the

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,389
outgoing axon so this neurons upside

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,949
down to the one I showed you previously

00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:36,480
and so this is nice i now have sort of a

00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:40,230
visual way to interact with my model but

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,230
okay now I've got to do this again

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,040
settle in each digit

00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,800
yes

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,449
jump forward so I now have I now have

00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,940
this nice way of interacting visually

00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,800
with my data but for a moment let's get

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,360
back to the problems in science that Tim

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,670
berners-lee saw in that he was trying to

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,720
solve with the web how are we doing

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:11,279
today well it's now like easy to just

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,079
browse online through scientific

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,050
publications of researchers from around

00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,810
the world they can share their code and

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,790
their data with us and I can point to a

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,170
number of websites in just in

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,579
neuroscience of loans such as new and

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,910
more food org where you'll find

00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:28,350
carefully curated data sets in addition

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,690
to this there's open source software

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:34,019
available to do different types of

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:38,310
simulations and analysis and put all

00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:39,779
different fields within science yet how

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:44,069
different is this really to before the

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:47,250
web arise arose it's now trivial to

00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:48,870
access all this data i agree but all of

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,889
it requires a high level of technical

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:54,259
expertise to understand and to use what

00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:57,810
if we started using and sharing

00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:59,339
interactive visualizations to let us

00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,130
fully explore the data without needing

00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,139
to install anything what if we started

00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,970
sharing interactive tools for performing

00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:08,069
analysis and simulations that could be

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:12,779
run by anywhere any that could be run by

00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:14,130
anyone anywhere researchers want to be

00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,240
able to share their findings they want

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,250
to be able to share the details of these

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,649
findings this is good for their career

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,759
and it's good for science in general

00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:22,380
they just haven't had good ways of doing

00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,209
this when they were specialized software

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,360
that was required for performing the

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:30,269
analysis simulations and even doing the

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,839
visualizations however this is starting

00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:35,550
to change recent developments in browser

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,730
technologies such as WebGL and

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,199
JavaScript libraries such as 3gs and d3

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:43,050
make the browser a compelling place to

00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,180
build useful visual you is for

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,610
scientific tools I would say it's much

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,829
easier now to create these online tools

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,240
than it is to create a native app to do

00:12:49,829 --> 00:13:00,029
the same thing and it's much more easily

00:12:51,240 --> 00:13:02,339
shareable and right so let's get back to

00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,310
me and my neurons I was nailed will to

00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,860
visualize these in 3d

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,240
and this is great but so what what I

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,860
actually wanted to do what I actually

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,260
was interested in its understanding how

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,410
these neurons worked and try to build

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,090
models of this behavior I was interested

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,950
in what it was that neurons actually do

00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,320
that when they connected up in these

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:26,420
larger networks somehow leads to

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,950
cognition somehow leads to us so to give

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,450
you a bit more of an understanding for

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,210
what we know about neurons let's go back

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,910
to our diagram so neurons communicate

00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,830
with each other within this network by

00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,339
sending bursts of electricity called

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,900
spikes or action potentials they send

00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:43,250
these out along their axons to the

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,860
connection between neurons called

00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:50,330
synapses when an action potential

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:52,130
arrives at a synapse it creates or any

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,960
juices in the target neuron in the

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,839
dendrite of the target neuron a much

00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,779
smaller pulse this small pulse then

00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:02,000
travels towards the soma just too too

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,650
excited a little bit and if there's

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,470
enough of these small pulses arriving at

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:09,980
the same time the neuron gets very

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:12,260
excited and it produces its own slack

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,839
its own action potential which travels

00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,310
out along the axon to signal other

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,450
neurons in the network and this is in

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,980
this way they communicate and this is

00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,500
often recreated artificially in

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,450
experiments through using stimulating

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,720
electrode that injects current directly

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:32,270
into the neuron and it was for doing

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,670
experiments like this one like like this

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:38,120
that two English scientists back in the

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,950
1950s called hodgkin-huxley developed

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,760
the first mathematical model of the

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,560
electrical behavior of a neuron they

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,020
they did these experiments on squid

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,170
giant axon which is a disappointingly

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,209
normal-sized squid that has a very large

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,310
axon and it was the size of this

00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:56,810
accident that allowed them to do these

00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:00,860
experiments with the technology that was

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:02,600
available to them at the time and they

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,640
won a Nobel Prize for this work which

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,560
they shared with a Melbourne researcher

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:11,089
in fact called tongue coach John Eccles

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,730
now I didn't have any code to show you

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:15,620
today but it's okay because I've got

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,070
something even better I've got some

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,070
equations

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,320
now you don't need to understand these

00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,700
equations but they tell you how the

00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,050
voltage and the difference teta

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,020
different ion channels within a neuron

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,340
change over time they're still widely

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,220
used within the neuroscience community

00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:36,000
or some variant of them and I use this

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,950
type of model in these type of equations

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,990
for my own research so the simulations I

00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,720
run i divided a neuron up into small

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,250
segments called compartments and this

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,980
set of equation gets applied to each of

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,110
those compartments in this way I can

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,270
simulate what it would be like to inject

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,670
current into a neuron or bombarding

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:59,500
you're on with synaptic synaptic inputs

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:03,130
like it like it does in the brain so

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,230
what I wanted was a visual tool to let

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,060
me to let me change the parameters of

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,800
this model and actually see what I was

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,690
doing to see the morphology and to see

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,950
how the parameters varied over that

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,450
morphology I also wanted a way to for a

00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:19,060
simulation that had been run look at the

00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,620
outputs look at what parts of the neuron

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,800
responded to can't be injected at a

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,530
particular point so I decided to build a

00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,330
tool to let me do this this is something

00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:31,960
I've spent a decent portion of the last

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:34,360
might say two years on I've learned it's

00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,340
taught me a lot and I've gotten a lot of

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,610
help from other people that I'm very

00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:43,870
very grateful for and what I've built

00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:45,150
I'm very proud of it's my baby and I'm

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,920
very excited to be I'll show you today

00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:51,070
so that what I'm going to demonstrate to

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,660
you is first of all how I can figure a

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,670
simulation and change the input

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,410
parameters and then I'm going to show

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,630
you a simulation that's already been run

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:04,180
we can visualize the outputs and see how

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:10,560
the new one response so let's push our

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:10,560
luck and do this again where is my mouse

00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:20,009
okay so here is here is the new

00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,169
interface it looks quite similar to the

00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:23,909
old one we've got still the purple and

00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:26,279
blue fibers representing the dendrites

00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:29,940
and the white one representing the axon

00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:31,470
we can still zoom and rotate the cell

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,100
body is now represented by severe so we

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:39,059
can see how large it is and this is all

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,769
a bit small so one big edition is now we

00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,269
can select a compartment and select a

00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:45,090
piece of the neuron and look at the

00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:47,490
properties of this so we can look at the

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,710
XYZ coordinates and the radius so things

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:53,190
about the morphology but we can also

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,840
look at some of the active electrical

00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,759
properties of the neuron we can look at

00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,899
its axial resistance and we can look at

00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,610
different properties of ion channels

00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:03,629
that exists within that part of the

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:07,649
neuron I can select multiple

00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:09,720
compartments and let's just change one

00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:16,470
of these parameters for that let's make

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:18,809
it a lot lower so that was easy but we

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,870
can't really see what we just did it

00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:23,940
looks the same so what I decided to

00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,919
build was a way that we can color the

00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,080
neuron by the different parameters that

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,110
we have in the model so I can color it

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,980
by this parameter we just changed

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:35,549
hopefully you can all see that there's

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,429
purple and blue there so what we're

00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:41,759
visualizing now is the conductance

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:43,529
density of sodium ion channels now these

00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,720
kind of control how excitable the cell

00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:47,639
is so we've got very high values high

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,039
densities of these in the summer and in

00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:52,769
the axon and lower values in the den

00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,889
drive and then much lower values where

00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:58,590
we manually change them so this is this

00:18:55,889 --> 00:19:01,740
is pretty useful and I can also color by

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,179
other things like the radius so you may

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,809
have noticed this is just a line drawing

00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:08,399
of a neuron now at some point I plan to

00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:10,980
sort of make this and into actual

00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:12,720
volumes that I render but it's not a big

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,519
priority because these fibers are quite

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,350
thin relative to the overall size of the

00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,289
neuron and it wouldn't look overly

00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:21,990
different but this lets us quickly and

00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:23,879
easily see what thickness the fibers are

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,320
we can see that this is this thick trunk

00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:27,210
going sort of vertically through the

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,149
neuron we see that the fibers get

00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:34,880
being as you travel out so i'll just go

00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:36,899
back and color by the type again so

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,169
importantly though i want to be able to

00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:41,370
inject current insist neuron 22 given an

00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:42,980
input basically that we could then

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,690
simulate something it could respond to

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:48,929
so we can go down to this tab and I can

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:53,640
inject some can't into it i can add an

00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:55,230
electrode just amount of it and using

00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,700
three jace i made this little graph so

00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,159
you can see the current overtime for

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,779
this electrode and we can change this i

00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:06,480
might make this pulse come in a bit

00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:09,299
later maybe it's larger maybe it's much

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,220
wider pulse we can also change it so

00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:15,360
that there's multiple pulses through the

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:19,110
simulation so let's now go to a

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,700
simulation I prepared earlier so this is

00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,159
quite similar to the one I just showed

00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,909
you here we've got current being ejected

00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:29,220
at 50 milliseconds into this part of the

00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:32,880
cell and if I go down the bottom we've

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:37,289
got this visualized tab and we can see a

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,390
similar sort of d3 line graph however

00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:40,919
this one represents the voltage over

00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,399
time this is an output of the model

00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,929
we've ran a simulation of this and we've

00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:48,539
got this response this is how the neuron

00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:49,529
responds and so a line graph like this

00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,510
and we can do it for different

00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:57,419
compartments so I can do it for one down

00:20:51,510 --> 00:21:00,240
here and we can zoom in on this this is

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,919
sort of the typical typical output of a

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,350
neural simulation you find how the

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:08,370
voltage changes at a particular point in

00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:09,929
the neuron usually the soma but for

00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:13,529
certain questions this isn't really

00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:15,390
enough so what I decided to do is the

00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:17,399
same way i was coloring the neuron by

00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:20,220
different input parameters i can color

00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:22,760
the neuron by the voltage and so we can

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,919
see now it's all gone purple so purple

00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,169
here represents about negative 65

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,539
millivolts it's the resting state of

00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:32,970
this neuron before any inputs come in

00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:35,490
and so what I'm going to do now is play

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,409
forward over the time where we inject

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,700
current into the cell and we're going to

00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:43,389
see how the neuron responds to this

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,679
so if I got in here and press play you

00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,120
can see where we're up to here current

00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:49,450
was about to be injected up here and

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,460
enough can't it enters the stoma too

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,769
excited and to produce an action

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:57,070
potential so I'll just play it back over

00:21:53,769 --> 00:22:04,740
this again so we can zoom in and rotate

00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:04,740
as this is happening thank you

00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:14,410
so back to power punch

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:35,130
yes good so believe it or not spikes

00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:37,710
like that are occurring billions of

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:41,850
times the second in your brains this is

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,559
how we think and do everything now I bet

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,910
most of you are pretty surprised to be

00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:49,320
learning about neuroscience at a

00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:51,270
JavaScript conference to me this is kind

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,860
of normal this is what I do but I

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,410
understand that this is somewhat niche

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,289
it doesn't really relate to what most of

00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:01,890
you would do day to day but the point of

00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:03,960
this is not about neuroscience the point

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:10,679
of this is that the web is changing

00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:12,960
science in general modern web browsers

00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,120
now allow us to deliver interactive

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,860
visualizations to fully explore data

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,809
into to visualize simulations coupled

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,280
with this we've got cloud-based

00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,799
technologies which can power these

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,380
interfaces now I haven't shown you this

00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:31,679
yet but that simulation of a neuron you

00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,900
just saw that was running the cloud by

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,090
pressing a button within that web app I

00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,010
could run a simulation of a neuron and

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:41,760
not care where the computation happened

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,720
and the point of this is that it didn't

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,450
have to be a neuron that I was

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,570
simulating in fact using what i learned

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:50,909
from building this tool me and others in

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:54,630
the lab built an analogous tool for

00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:58,860
simulating the weather it's a bit lazy

00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,299
of me so i'm going to show you a

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,179
demonstration of this now and i think

00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:05,460
this will help you appreciate how how

00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:07,080
generally applicable the web is to

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,900
science and how much can change science

00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,320
in general so going to do this a few

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,320
more times

00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:32,220
okay so here is our interface for our

00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:34,259
weather simulation tool thank you now

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:38,460
you can see it let's make it a bit

00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:40,619
bigger so we're no longer looking at a

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,269
three-dimensional view of a neuron this

00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:45,479
is something we're all more familiar

00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:47,009
with we're looking at a map so we're

00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:50,399
looking at budapest here and we've got

00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:52,169
this big rectangle around the city so

00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:55,229
this is this is the area that we might

00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:57,929
want to simulate the weather for we can

00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:59,549
make that much larger and look at a much

00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:10,849
larger grid and get the weather for now

00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:10,849
decent part of europe and we can hold on

00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:15,479
ok i need to make the internet work

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,989
before we do the next bit but that's

00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:20,940
okay and i can choose where it is so i

00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:22,169
could go to where i live in melbourne

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,139
australia and we could look we could

00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:28,109
simulate the weather there and i could

00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:30,269
we could perform a simulation of or a

00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:32,429
forecast rather of the weather going

00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,649
forward several days into the future or

00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:36,869
we could do something else that's quite

00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:38,220
common which is called a hindcast so

00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:42,029
this is where we go to a previous point

00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:44,549
in time and simulate using existing

00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:46,049
weather observations create a much more

00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:48,599
detailed simulation of what the weather

00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:51,029
was or would have been in that location

00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:53,399
and so it's an example of that that i'm

00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:58,859
going to show you now for the weather

00:25:53,399 --> 00:26:00,389
over Barcelona so here we see a heat map

00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:02,249
of the temperature or the surface

00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:04,619
temperature for this region that

00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:06,659
includes Barcelona and I'm going to play

00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:08,849
forward over a couple of days so we can

00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:11,070
see how this changes you'll see it go

00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:12,570
yellow over the land during the day as

00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,059
things heat up and it will stay

00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:18,029
relatively constant over the

00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:20,639
Mediterranean so if we play forward like

00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:22,289
this we see this is what is predicted

00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:24,659
the the weather to be like and we can

00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:26,279
see the outline of a mountain range

00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:29,779
there where it doesn't get quite as warm

00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,779
I think that's the Pyrenees

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:43,790
yeah so back to PowerPoint and while I'm

00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:50,050
here I'm going to turn off Wi-Fi and see

00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:50,050
you how that goes can you see that no

00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:01,110
excellent

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,900
so meteorology and neuroscience are very

00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,179
different fields but despite that these

00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,590
two apps share a lot in common in both

00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:10,710
cases we were able to move everything

00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:12,270
online to use cloud-based resources in

00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,360
both cases we did away with the need to

00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:18,929
install files or sorry to organize files

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:23,880
or install software but having a web app

00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:25,530
that can do this this is my web app that

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,150
is able to orchestrate these simulations

00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,850
to store the inputs and to store the

00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:34,410
outputs this is by no means trivial and

00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:36,270
it certainly wasn't to me luckily though

00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,820
I work with a lot of amazing people at

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:42,090
IBM Research whom I could learn from and

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:44,190
who could guide me in this the other

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,230
benefit to working for IBM is that I

00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:49,890
have access to these new web and cloud

00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:51,270
technologies that are available because

00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,750
we we acquired the companies that

00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:58,530
develop them so I've deployed my web app

00:27:54,750 --> 00:28:00,450
in bluemix so this is a service built

00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,220
around cloud foundry for deploying web

00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,530
apps and it lets you connect in other

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,299
services very easily like databases so I

00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,760
use a database to keep track of the

00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:11,460
simulations in their state and these

00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,790
simulations have to run somewhere and so

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:18,240
I need to put these on virtual machines

00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:20,070
in the cloud and they run using C++ code

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,770
that was in fact written by my manager

00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:27,150
and this c++ code runs inside a docker

00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:28,440
container and it generates upwards and

00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,760
it has to put these outputs somewhere

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,530
and we want them somewhere where they're

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,169
very accessible from where the browser

00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:37,790
can access them easily and for this we

00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:41,250
use object storage which is terrific for

00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:42,600
large size data files that you want to

00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,169
make easily accessible to the browser

00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,270
you can create a temporary URL and so

00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:50,549
both of these things can be offered to

00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:54,240
us to an IBM acquisition called

00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:55,740
softlayer and so this is the basic

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,360
architecture and you'll notice there's

00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,480
nothing to do with neuroscience or

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,520
meteorology here that'll happens in the

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,550
browser locally or at the very back end

00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,140
in our docker container this is

00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,059
generally applicable to any sort of

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,320
scientific problem or in fact any

00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,130
problem where you need to analyze data

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,830
or performs

00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:18,990
relations and so do you see what's

00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,060
happened here from its birthplace in

00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,740
science the web has come full circle and

00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,830
is now offering new possibilities and

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,090
new opportunities to science and it's

00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,490
for this reason that I'd like to see a

00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:32,850
larger overlap between the scientific

00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:37,140
and the web communities and to this end

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:40,620
a friend of mine Isabel and I developed

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,930
a course to teach academic researchers

00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,850
about the web give them basic web

00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:48,290
development understanding of HTML and

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:52,800
JavaScript and CSS and how to use a

00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:55,380
visualization library called III so we

00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,240
developed this course sorry I'm supposed

00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,490
together we developed this course and

00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,650
his Isabel tweeting about it and we

00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,910
developed it all online on github so

00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,350
that other people can contribute and

00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,050
more important other people could use it

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,550
to teach it wherever they were and in

00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:11,070
fact before we even have the chance to

00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:13,890
teach it someone else picked it up and

00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:17,970
decided to teach it they taught it at

00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:21,990
CERN believe it or not it was part of a

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:23,850
student summer web fest and I just think

00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,500
this is really cool cern is embracing

00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:30,080
the fruits of the web that they helped

00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:32,360
create so before i leave you today i

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,860
want to show you something that was

00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,770
unfathomable back when Tim berners-lee

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,930
first proposed the web I want to show

00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:42,150
you a simulation of a neuron that's

00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,940
happening in the cloud in real time from

00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:47,280
the browser so in real time we're going

00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,350
to to watch the electrical activity

00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,650
travel through this neuron as it's being

00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:58,950
simulated assuming that demo gods allow

00:30:52,650 --> 00:31:01,340
us to okay everything's looking pretty

00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,340
good

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,309
let me jump back here so this is where

00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:10,379
we were and if I jump back out we can

00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:12,480
see this was one simulation in a gallery

00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:13,980
of simulations so the green ones the

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,440
ones that have been previously simulated

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,590
and the yellow ones are new ones that

00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:23,370
we're still configuring and haven't yet

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:25,500
haven't yet run and and this is this is

00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,960
great because this is all online so

00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,460
people collaborating together can access

00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,659
and see what their what each other are

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:35,580
working on they can put a new model up

00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,320
and tell the others possibly on the

00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,240
other side of the world to check out the

00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,059
new model I developed what do you think

00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,970
and so we can create a copy of this

00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:47,639
simulation here a new copy that we can

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:51,899
modify and then simulate and this is

00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:53,009
going extraordinarily well so this is

00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:56,399
the simulation we're looking at before

00:31:53,009 --> 00:32:01,230
let's now add a few more inputs so let's

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:13,500
add let's add one up here and let's make

00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:15,289
it happen at 75 300 that's good but it's

00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:21,960
a bit boring let's add another one here

00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:23,220
so let's make that happen at 100 and

00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,149
let's make it last 400 hundred

00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:30,029
milliseconds and let's make it really

00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:34,110
strong let's give it a thousand Pico

00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:36,059
amps okay so I've got the simulation

00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,379
ready now so what we can do is go up the

00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:40,919
top here and there's a button called

00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:42,779
simulate so i can press that and it now

00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,509
says it's running so what's happening

00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:47,669
now is that all our new inputs were sent

00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:49,500
back up to the server and it was told i

00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:53,309
want to simulate this so it puts the

00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:55,320
data in object storage and it puts this

00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:57,539
job in a queue saying please simulate

00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,230
this I then have a worker that picks it

00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:05,309
up and and downloads the data it needs

00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:09,960
and starts simulating and as it

00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:12,659
simulates it'll output is not working

00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,980
as it's simulating it will start

00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:18,120
outputting data he does not yet let's

00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,210
give it a bit longer I have a back-up

00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,010
plan so as its as simulating it outputs

00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,299
data into object storage which is the

00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,520
browser can then check to see whether

00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:28,260
it's there and if it is it can download

00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:32,190
and present it to us before the

00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:35,279
simulations even finished doesn't look

00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:36,450
like we're going to be so lucky today in

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,809
fact i think the simulation is maybe

00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,809
finished

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:50,280
no I'm uneven that's right I once again

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,810
prepared one familiar so just imagine

00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,810
this is still running in real time so

00:33:54,830 --> 00:34:00,480
I'll play this for you now so again

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,820
initially we'll have the same pulse that

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,860
we injected last time and then we'll

00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:12,120
have one a bit further away so up here

00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:13,590
and the next one will come in no one is

00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,080
going to be awkward pauses exciting time

00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:18,140
this one so what's it well and so this

00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,550
one isn't enough to excite the cell and

00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:26,730
then in a little bit we'll just really

00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:28,620
hammer it so as I mentioned my manager

00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,420
he wrote the C++ code that runs the

00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:33,090
simulation and he kind of insisted on

00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,560
doing this because he done a bunch of

00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:37,350
times and he knew exactly how it needed

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,090
to be done but this is the first time

00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,310
he's been able to watch as the

00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:44,280
simulations been running and really see

00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,990
what was happening in the cell this is I

00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,260
think something that science badly needs

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:54,030
in all fields of science I see it as the

00:34:49,260 --> 00:35:02,610
future of science and so before I go I

00:34:54,030 --> 00:35:05,960
need to affect about that and spoil us

00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,960
know you can see that

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:12,430
and so I'm used to giving academic

00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:13,750
conference talks and those always end

00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,660
with an acknowledgement slide sorry

00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:19,240
that's what I'm going to do today so the

00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,280
first person i thank is Glen Madden so

00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,859
he was who got me into web in the first

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,310
place and he continues to be a mentor in

00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:29,200
anything web related secondly like that

00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,900
Isabel Kiril kornek who I mentioned

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,660
earlier with whom I developed the d3

00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:38,109
course to teach to researchers she also

00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:41,560
is happy to supply endless feedback for

00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:44,589
any project I've been working on I'd

00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:47,020
like to thank certain members of the web

00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:48,310
community who first suggest that I could

00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,530
speak at a JavaScript conference like

00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,560
this and for helping me craft my

00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:55,240
submission but I'd like to thank all of

00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,800
you this is such a welcoming community

00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:01,869
for someone sort of coming from the

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:04,450
outside seriously you're great I'd like

00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:06,670
to acknowledge IBM research IBM Research

00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,319
Australia who sent me here and who have

00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,390
supported this work and encouraged me

00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:11,800
and I'd like to acknowledge all the

00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,410
people I work with who have contributed

00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,680
to this so it specifically Tim and

00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:20,020
Jordan there who built most of the the

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,900
weather the weather up that was only

00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:26,170
partly me and as I mentioned my manager

00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:29,079
John Wagner who who wrote the C++ code

00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:32,020
that ran in the back end and finally I'd

00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:33,160
like to thank jay is conf Budapest for

00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,780
having me here today and for being

00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:39,849
awesome and and before I forget I'd like

00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:43,690
to thank Jake for fixing my presentation

00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:46,560
and finally I like to thank all of you

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,560
cheers
