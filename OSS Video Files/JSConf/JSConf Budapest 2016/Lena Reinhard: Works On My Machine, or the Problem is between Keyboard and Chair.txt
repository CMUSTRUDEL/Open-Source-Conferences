Title: Lena Reinhard: Works On My Machine, or the Problem is between Keyboard and Chair
Publication date: 2016-06-20
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2016
Description: 
	You've heard it before: "It works on my machine" and you know the punchline "so your problem isn't real". Sometimes a bug just won't appear on your system: computers are fickle beasts full of subtlety. Humans too, but more so: we have habits, preferences, biases, and our background, opportunities vary wildly. And even the technology industry itself is a perfect example of legacy spaghetti code (without unit tests), and this makes it very hard to debug for a better future.

In this talk we will look at the many facets that affect our decision making and interactions, and work out how we can change for the better. Together, we will take a look at the effects that our software has on the daily lives of the thousands of people who are using it. You’ll learn what you can do as an individual to support change into a positive direction, and how you can help debug this system and make a difference in the tech industry. You’ll leave knowing about practical things you can do in your daily life to make the tech industry a better, more inclusive and diverse environment that is a better place for everyone.

Trigger Warning: Mention of assault, abuse, rape and death threats, rape, racism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, abuse. Discussion of harassment.

thank you very much I'm so happy to be

00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:14,900
here how have you enjoyed past two days

00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,119
that wasn't that much have you liked it

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,769
that's the spirit and so maybe first of

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,019
all we've had great talks and you're all

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:32,210
great people so maybe give a big hand to

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,210
the organizers give it up for them

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,970
so last talked let's do this before I

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,430
start I want to give a trigger warning

00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,560
for this talk this hope will include

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,920
mention of harassment misogyny

00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:56,940
transphobia homophobia racism sexism

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,980
rape and death threats and abuse so as

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,800
Jake so eloquently said my name is Lena

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,350
vinod I'm a team leader consultant

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,810
writer and photographer and Carly live

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,940
in Berlin in Germany and if you're on

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,340
Twitter my user handle there is a tell

00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:15,390
our and RD sarto remember remember so I

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,100
put it on the slides and today I want to

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,440
talk to you about software bugs because

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,450
that's such a great topic raise your

00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,509
hands who of you is a software developer

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:31,940
that's quite plenty maybe sixty percent

00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:35,190
two of you like software with bugs maybe

00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,890
10 people I want to have a conversation

00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,570
with you later and two of you enjoys

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,570
that moment when you fix the bug and

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,870
software works again that's almost

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,710
everyone awesome so bug fixing what are

00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:52,260
bugs software bugs are errors flaws or

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,540
failures in software that cause the

00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,900
software to produce incorrect undesired

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,360
or unexpected output a but can be many

00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,850
things like a system error performance

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,710
problem configuration issue or an issue

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,660
with functionality at all points in the

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,170
development cycle we can end up with

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,660
thoughts and our software so we need to

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,489
debug it we need to find and resolve

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,400
these defects that we have in a system

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,950
or in a software but debugging can be

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,269
hard and it becomes even harder the more

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,010
complex or software becomes in debugging

00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:31,549
one of the most interesting and

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,019
difficult challenges is spaghetti code

00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:36,530
spaghetti code is slang for code that's

00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:39,120
unnecessarily complex convoluted and

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,340
difficult to read or follow by human

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,560
just like it's very difficult to follow

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,740
one single piece of spaghetti when you

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,810
have a pastor mountain on your plate

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,180
spaghetti code can be code that's not

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,430
organized uses lots of go-to statements

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,580
has many interdependencies or jumps

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,410
around between different areas or files

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,220
it has often grown over many years and

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:05,910
many people have contributed to it and

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:09,480
it's very difficult to debug as people

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,940
in tech were used to bugs they kept

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,560
their part of our daily lives but

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,210
there's another thing that's part of our

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,730
lives a software developers and other

00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,670
people in tech another system that

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:24,480
contains bugs the tech industry itself

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:27,150
in this talk I will show you in which

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,850
ways this industry is buggy why we

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:34,500
should care about that and how to debug

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:36,960
it the tech industry is a lot like a big

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,490
system of spaghetti code it has grown

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,310
over time and many people have

00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,020
contributed to it it's also a system

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,630
that contains many different intertwined

00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,610
parts with dependencies and it it's

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,830
important it's an important system with

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,980
huge impact it's still one of the

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,320
fastest growing industries worldwide and

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:58,010
technology or lack thereof influences

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,180
the daily lives of many people worldwide

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:05,430
this is why we need to look at this

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:07,560
industry and its effects to understand

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,110
the system it helps understand it its

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,620
parts so let's look at which parts

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,540
define the tech industry as a system

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:19,830
I've created a simplified Venn diagram

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,950
to show them to you first of all you can

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:25,140
see society much like software systems

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,970
don't exist in isolation the tech

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,540
industry also belongs to something

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,420
larger part of the tech industry are

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,100
communities like floss or free libre and

00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,790
open source software communities or

00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:41,310
local tech communities then we have

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,230
companies some companies or the people

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,090
in them contribute to communities or a

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:49,230
part of them so we have an overlap here

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:51,780
and finally there are humans and here

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:55,169
you can see one of us this is me and

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,960
this is you some of us work at companies

00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,910
some of us are part of communities all

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,760
of us are in some way in tech

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:07,710
and all these parts together influence

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:09,810
this industry one of the most common

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,550
problems in handling bugs as you may all

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,430
know is the misconception of what

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:18,050
actually constitutes a bug the classic

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:21,030
question is it a bug or is it a feature

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,890
when debugging software systems we bring

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,880
our very own personal and technical

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:29,700
skills preferences knowledge 'as and

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,350
limitations so when you want to

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,330
understand how these different parts

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,700
we've looked at our influence the tech

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:39,060
industry we need to understand ourselves

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:44,910
first our own skills abilities and

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:47,240
limitations some effects can exist in

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:50,040
our society with ease and can influence

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,700
which gives us advantages relative to

00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,900
other people we have privileged

00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,700
privileged comes from various factors

00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,800
like our gender race class education

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:05,090
upbringing our ability appearance

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,680
physical and mental health and many more

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,140
privilege is a shield that protects us

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,700
from problems and it blocks parts of our

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:17,460
perception privilege is like being in

00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:20,280
your cozy sunny home over there reading

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,780
a book and not even noticing that a

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,540
thunderstorm is about to happen around

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,320
you the thunderstorm that could cause

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,850
the people outside their lives

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,560
privileged in tech is when you can

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,020
attend a conference party without fear

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,460
that someone will harass you when you

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,900
can have drinks with colleagues every

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,550
other night because you don't have to

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,970
take care of the child or elderly

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,950
relatives at home privileged in tech is

00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,020
when you can stand in the daily stand-up

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:49,350
meeting and don't have to sit because of

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,240
a disability or illness and when you can

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,070
publish a post about a framework online

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,690
without getting rape or death threats in

00:06:53,070 --> 00:07:00,840
return privilege is a classic example of

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:03,690
but it works on my machine or but it

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,430
works in my life it puts us in a

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,200
position where we don't see problems in

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,140
tech because we're not personally

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,700
affected by them a position where we

00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,710
don't even have to think about the fact

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,860
that not all lives and all

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:20,550
jeans are the same privilege is a

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,930
comfortable position of ignorance and we

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,840
have to actively work through our

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:27,360
privileges to make sure we see more than

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,610
our tiny portion of the world and to

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:34,410
understand what the tech industry really

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:37,520
looks like another factor that limits

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:40,500
our perception our biases every moment

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,320
our brains receive 11 million pieces of

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,730
information but we can only process 40

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,150
of those pieces pieces with our

00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:50,070
conscious biases our assumptions we use

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,220
to deal with this huge amount of

00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:55,080
information that our brains receive and

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,940
biases are attached to the idea that we

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,170
can judge something just by looking at

00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:04,860
it they're based on our past knowledge

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:07,080
experiences and cultural norms biases

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,460
are great for seeing there's an animal

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:14,010
it has four legs lots of hair it's light

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:18,150
brown and it's not a dog or cat this is

00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:20,340
a lion I should run but biases are not

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:23,250
good for judging people that we use them

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:27,600
for it and we even think that we're

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:31,080
being objective while doing so these

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,120
biases lead to unfair preferences women

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,550
earn less money for the exact same job

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,230
than men do candidates who are

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,270
interviewed on sunny days have a better

00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,860
chance of being hired then candidus

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,400
candidates were interviewed on rainy

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,710
days and tall men move into leadership

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,660
positions more frequently than shorter

00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:52,740
mean we all have these biases

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,020
understanding in which ways we're biased

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,630
can help us understand the text adders

00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:02,190
of tech better and who are personally

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:04,080
contributing to it an extremely

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,390
important skill all of us need is

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,690
empathy and many people have mentioned

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,970
it over the past two days empathy is the

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,070
ability to relate to another person as

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,050
though they were us it's a powerful

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,330
skill that enables us to think of the

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,530
consequences of our words and actions on

00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:25,370
people and as humans working on software

00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,370
empathy is our responsibility

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:31,600
and we also needed to understand the

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,760
status of the tech industry as we've

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,950
seen up to now understanding our

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,780
privileges working through our biases

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,910
and practicing empathy helps us

00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,910
understand the status of our system now

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,670
let's use this knowledge to run a

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,780
systems diagnosis of the tech industry

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:58,330
and its parts the smallest entity in the

00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,890
system is one human and we've talked

00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,060
about ourselves already but our

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:07,360
privileges biases and lack of empathy

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,850
next up we have companies Conway's law

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,190
says that systems which are designed in

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,050
organizations are copies of the

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,080
communication structures in these

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,670
organizations this means that our

00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,860
company structures will directly

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,880
influence the software we build whether

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,560
we are aware of it or not so what do the

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,190
structures in our organizations look

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,190
like most European tech companies

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:35,620
consist mostly of sis white mini and sis

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,900
means that a person's experience of

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,740
their own gender matches the sex they

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,690
were assigned at Birth in Europe less

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,060
than thirty percent of employees in tech

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,910
are women in less than ten percent

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,890
worker software developers so more than

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,700
ninety percent of software developers in

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:56,640
Europe arsis white min and we don't even

00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,050
have data on other aspects of humanity

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,750
we don't even have numbers on how many

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:06,010
people of color lesbian gay bisexual

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,960
queer non-binary intersexual people or

00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,660
disabled people work in tech here and

00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,860
these are just examples of many groups

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:16,330
that are currently hugely

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:19,690
underrepresented in this industry what

00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,310
we have are homogeneous organizations we

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,300
have a huge lack of diversity in

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:27,610
ethnicities genders backgrounds

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:32,050
education upbringing life experiences

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:37,360
ages languages ideas disabilities and

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:39,270
abilities and more but creativity is an

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,970
important driver for good design

00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:45,150
nearing but our ability to be truly

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:49,110
creative in our teams depends on exactly

00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:51,110
these factors this is one of the reasons

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,060
why our lack of diversity is so harmful

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,920
it even blocks our ability to be truly

00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:00,060
creative when we design and build

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,550
software we all live in diverse

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,640
societies but our organizations don't

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,650
reflect that the products we build in

00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,300
these homogenous organizations right now

00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,270
just don't work for our diverse

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,640
population which even makes many of our

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:21,300
products completely unusable for so many

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:24,030
people thing is even if tech companies

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,540
manage to hire a diverse workforce most

00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:29,220
of the times they don't keep them

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,590
forty-one percent of women leave careers

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,890
in technology after ten years that's

00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,660
more than twice the number of min the

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:40,310
reason for these bad retention rates is

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:43,230
that our companies fail at inclusion

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,450
inclusion means that all individuals in

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,880
a group are being valued respected and

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:51,270
supported and it means facilitating

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:55,010
cultures practices and relationships to

00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:57,060
support a diverse workforce so right now

00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:58,710
it's hard getting members of

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,180
underrepresented groups into tech

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,390
because it's such a hostile environment

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,340
and as soon as they are in we largely

00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,590
drive these skilled experts out again in

00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:11,250
a very short time because we don't

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,800
really care about them this goes for our

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,860
companies and also goes for our

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,930
communities the lack of diversity and

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:22,560
inclusion in our communities is even

00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:24,870
worse than an average companies 85 to 95

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,790
percent of all contributors to free

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,760
labor and open source software projects

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,820
are min they're also mostly white and

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,650
most of them are software developers

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,210
very few people with other professions

00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:40,410
and expertise contribute to these

00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:42,630
projects and since these contributions

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,240
are mostly expected to be done in

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:47,700
people's airtime everyone who has other

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,240
obligations by caring for children is

00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,680
excluded and most projects are neither

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,700
accessible no

00:13:52,680 --> 00:14:00,450
coming for beginners another big issue

00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,399
in communities is harassment there are

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:05,960
hundreds of reports of harassment

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:09,720
misogyny transphobia homophobia racism

00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,610
threats sexism and abuse that people

00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,990
have experienced in floss projects in

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:18,510
the communities and at events our tech

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,310
communities are completely unsafe space

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:25,130
for underrepresented groups in tech

00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:27,779
right now and on top of all of that our

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,230
society's influence as personally and

00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:33,330
the tech industry we live in patriarchy

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,839
a social construct that is oppressive on

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,610
humans our societies are also capitalist

00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,700
systems that have led to wealth and

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,860
income inequalities and we live in

00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,540
racist societies that Center upon the

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,580
false belief that white people are

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:51,390
superior to add people of other racial

00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,670
backgrounds together patriarchy

00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:57,209
capitalism and racism have led to

00:14:53,670 --> 00:15:00,209
oppressive systems these systems are big

00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:05,880
influencers on ourselves our beliefs and

00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:08,760
our work in tech we've now looked at all

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,380
these parts isolated from each other but

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,600
a system is more than just the sum of

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,510
its parts but I mean your developers you

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,390
know that all parts that influence the

00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,410
tech industry are intertwined and

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,690
accumulate characteristics of other

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:25,770
poets which has made many of them even

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:29,040
worse as a system the tech industry is a

00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:32,790
place full of privilege biases that legs

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,770
empathy diversity and inclusion is full

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:41,339
of harassment and is shaped by

00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:44,120
patriarchy capitalism and racism so how

00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,120
do we handle this

00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,490
when we want to understand and debug an

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,800
unfamiliar system it helps to play

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,830
around with variables and see how they

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,960
affect the output one of the outputs of

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,450
the tech industry as a system is the

00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:05,470
software we build so let's see what the

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:07,410
software looks like software can have

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,850
positive impact on people's lives

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,250
software can help satisfy our basic

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:15,550
human needs for safety belonging and

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,350
self-actualization for example by

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,260
helping us communicate with others for

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,210
applications or by making information

00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,750
and communication tools accessible for

00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:28,080
people through screen readers software

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,780
like the application be my eyes also

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:34,480
helps people with visual impairments

00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,100
catalpa certain tasks and some software

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,170
can also help people with mental or

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,760
physical illnesses improve their

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:44,560
situation through online self-help

00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:46,660
programs but software also causes lots

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,430
of harm and it can even endanger

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:53,050
people's lives our software is sexist

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,990
when virtual assistants like Apple's

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:58,780
Siri Google now or Microsoft Cortana are

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:01,780
told that a user had a heart attack they

00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,400
redirect them to help but none of these

00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,080
assistance has been programmed to

00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,600
recognize what it means when a user

00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:11,560
sense that they're being abused which

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,960
affects one in three women worldwide our

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,690
software is racist face recognition

00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,790
algorithms in camera sensors keep on

00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:23,080
failing to recognize the faces of people

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:26,530
of color correctly our software worsens

00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:28,720
issues in societies vacation rental and

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,670
accommodation sharing sites like Airbnb

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,250
are contributing to a growing housing

00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:36,340
crisis in cities like New York London

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:40,480
and Berlin by removing rental stock from

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:42,040
already tight housing markets our

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,710
software also exposes people to

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,600
harassment and abuse major tech

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,130
companies like Twitter and Facebook have

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,130
been failing to address the harassment

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:52,690
issues on their platforms for years

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,490
which has made many of these important

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,020
technologies completely unusable for

00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:00,890
many people

00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:03,050
our software also puts people at risk on

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,640
a regular basis we expose users too

00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,620
dangerous through security flaws and

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,650
we've built tools that have enabled

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,210
personal data to be exposed online which

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,600
has put people's personal safety at

00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:17,060
stake and car dispatch startups like

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,430
uber keep not doing anything to ensure

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,380
passenger safety in the cars despite

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:25,040
several cases of assault against

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:27,700
passengers over the past years and our

00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,440
software is actively making people sick

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,570
the animations in our operating systems

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,690
apps and websites can trigger panic

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,970
attacks to people and software has

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,700
helped cars emit more pollution on the

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:45,710
road than in regulatory tests pollution

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:47,800
that is making people sick this is the

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:51,080
output of the tech industry as a system

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:55,970
we are part of the system and this is

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,530
what all worked us to people and even if

00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,900
the technology you're working on right

00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:02,050
now may feel like a good project for you

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:06,020
and you feel like it doesn't do any harm

00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:07,850
you need to care about that as well what

00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,590
we need to understand is that as people

00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,530
in tech we have a collective

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,290
responsibility we keep pretending that

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,120
the technology we build is neutral we

00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:20,090
still believe that we can be a political

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,880
as people in check we keep pretending

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,680
that our algorithms on you troll and we

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,410
don't care about the ethical aspects of

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,160
our work and most of us are in a

00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:33,100
position where we don't have to care but

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,920
it's our responsibility to understand

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:40,850
technology is not neutral or code is not

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:44,800
neutral our work is political and our

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:47,510
work has consequences on actual lives

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:51,380
what we have right now is a completely

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:53,840
broken system right now this industry is

00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:57,290
system built on privilege by privileged

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,120
people for privileged people this system

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,250
works for sis white men inside and

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,810
outside of this industry but for almost

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:07,850
no one else right now we're failing many

00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,850
underrepresented people inside of tech

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:13,340
and the system come generate meaningful

00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,620
put we're failing to build real

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:19,880
solutions for our software User's actual

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:22,490
problems this is why we need to change

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,730
this industry's inner mechanisms and its

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:33,560
output to something meaningful we need

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:35,870
to debug it but who is we as we've seen

00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,820
one reason for this industry's problem

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:41,360
exists between keyboard and chair and

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:44,690
this time it's not our users this time

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:48,020
it's us as humans we are contributing to

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,150
the status of this tech industry but

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:54,920
we're also part of the solution for

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:56,650
these problems here's wine if you look

00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,300
closely at this Venn diagram again

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:02,780
you'll see that there's one spot where

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:05,330
all pods overlap this one's bought with

00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:08,900
one person who is in tech as part of a

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:13,250
team or community or by themselves this

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:15,530
person is you this place right where you

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,860
are this is where debugging the tech

00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:22,010
industry happens every one of us has

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,710
this area where we can fix things every

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,450
one of us is part of something bigger

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,490
we're working at companies some of us

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,640
are part of communities we know other

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:37,010
people in this industry whatever you do

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:39,560
in tech you have such an area the sizes

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:41,930
of our areas defer the more privilege

00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,030
and power we have the bigger our area is

00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:46,940
in which we can make this change happen

00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:51,680
and the more it is our responsibility to

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:53,930
do just that but what we experience

00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,600
right now as an industry is another case

00:21:53,930 --> 00:22:00,470
of it works on my machine so your

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:03,380
problem isn't real right now many areas

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,180
for change go unused because many of us

00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,880
don't know or don't care about the

00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:10,280
brokenness of the system because the

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:14,930
system works for us and we benefit from

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,370
the status quo right now most of the

00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,740
people who are already working on

00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:21,650
debugging this industry are members of

00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,210
underrepresented groups in tech that's a

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,260
bit like telling the QA team in your

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,760
company

00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,500
that they have to fix the bugs they find

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,700
themselves because you have better

00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:34,640
things to do but it's the responsibility

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:37,460
of all of us to help debug this industry

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,490
it's my responsibility and it's your

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,880
responsibility change thoughts in this

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:46,780
area change starts with me and change

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,780
thoughts with you

00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,460
over the next minutes I'll show you 11

00:22:56,539 --> 00:23:00,320
debugging tools and techniques that you

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:05,179
can use to support the debugging process

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:07,460
in the tech industry debugging starts

00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:11,720
with ourselves and the basis for all

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,640
debugging work step 1 learning we need

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,700
to educate ourselves and learn about

00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,020
systemic issues and depression in tech

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,880
there are many great resources online

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,429
that can help you understand to this

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,760
debugging process it's not the

00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:26,840
responsibility of others to educate us

00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,090
learning about debugging the tech

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,090
industry is our personal responsibility

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:37,250
we need to practice empathy empathy and

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,730
actually caring about other people is a

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,409
choice and a skill we can improve we

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,870
need to understand that not everyone is

00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:46,700
like us and understand that the life

00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:50,860
experiences of people who are different

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:53,360
from us are just as valid as our own

00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,679
empathy also means understanding that

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,190
our software is a personal experience

00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,990
for our users all expressions and

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,450
interactions we build in our software

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:05,809
are choices that affect the way our

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,640
users feel we can't be good designers

00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:13,309
and software developers if we don't

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:15,169
actively work on our empathy step three

00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:18,730
is to understand our position in the

00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:21,500
world as people in tech we have power

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,899
the tech industry has turned this notion

00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,330
of power into a culture of celebrating

00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:29,960
so called coder ninjas rock stars and

00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:33,440
unicorns I hate to break the news to you

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:37,159
but we're not none of us are ninjas rock

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,130
stars unicorns all of us are humans and

00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,899
all of us fail this should fill us with

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,289
humbleness and awareness of our own

00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:50,899
limitations and should have us work on

00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:53,840
all humility step four is understanding

00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:55,460
our privileges we need to understand how

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,320
our position in the world has been

00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,470
shaped in terms of privilege and class

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:04,010
and race and in which ways we benefit

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,750
from the existing systems around us this

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,890
can be a chance for us to learn which

00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,720
mistakes we've made in the

00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,990
costs and how we can prevent these

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,270
mistakes in the future we also need to

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,970
use a privilege for good work on

00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:22,340
ourselves and set positive examples for

00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:25,490
our peers we need to work through our

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:28,520
biases we need to be conscious about our

00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,110
past present and huge yourself and be

00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,560
deliberate about our actions and

00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,720
interactions with people practically

00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,120
this also means being deliberate about

00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,310
the software we build and making sure

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,940
that the software is not only appealing

00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:47,950
to people who are like us every app icon

00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:50,450
matters and every image matters

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,640
companies and communities need to put

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,190
policies in place to work through biases

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,740
and avoid basing our work on assumptions

00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:02,690
about the people we work with and the

00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:04,970
people who use our software we need to

00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,430
listen to what underrepresented people

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,990
in tech have to say follow them on

00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,390
Twitter read their blogs and

00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:14,450
publications and look outside of your

00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:16,370
existing networks we need to actively

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:20,750
look for the voices we haven't heard

00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:23,600
before and we need to amplify these

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:26,120
voices the voices of people whose

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,020
stories often remain unheard to help

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:32,470
them reach border audiences amplifying

00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,730
others voices also means speaking less

00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,470
there is no need to comment on

00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:43,310
everything that underrepresented people

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:46,490
in tech are sharing we need to listen we

00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:48,800
also need to work on diversity first and

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:51,830
foremost diversity is our moral

00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,410
obligation it's the only way to do

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:56,900
software development right the only way

00:26:54,410 --> 00:27:01,070
to do right by the people in tech and by

00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:02,600
our software uses diversity also enables

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:06,590
us to build products that are actually

00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,480
useful for people it also allows us to

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,810
solve complex complex problems better

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,460
and faster be more creative make better

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:17,810
decisions and generate more innovation

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,450
companies with diverse leadership have

00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:22,179
better sales revenue

00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:25,840
customers higher market share and higher

00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:27,389
profits than their competitors diversity

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,220
also helps companies with hiring

00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:34,870
learning leads to better software and

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:37,690
happier customers and still diversity is

00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:40,090
our moral obligation it's the only way

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:44,769
to do software right there is no

00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:48,039
alternative and there's no alternative

00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:49,450
to inclusion either we need to work on

00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,730
inclusion in our workplaces and

00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,740
communities we need to foster

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,320
environments in which diverse groups of

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,480
people can thrive it's our

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,450
responsibility as privileged people in

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,620
tech to facilitate spaces in which under

00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:07,450
represented people want to be we also

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,250
need policies for equality and social

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:12,909
conduct and we need to communicate

00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:15,460
openly about our values we need to do

00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:19,720
everything to make spaces welcoming and

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:21,880
safe for everyone and our efforts that

00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:27,309
going to inclusion show how much we

00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:29,679
actually care about diversity we also

00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:32,500
need to give give our knowledge

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,059
technical skills time and money to

00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,360
groups or individuals in this industry

00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:40,149
who I need of support we can become

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,070
coaches at meetups or become mentors we

00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:44,919
can donate money to organizations like

00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:47,830
trans heck women who code rails girls

00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,260
black girls code or Model View culture

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:55,929
that do important work to debug this

00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:58,000
industry and each of us needs to work on

00:28:55,929 --> 00:29:01,450
being an ally to underrepresented groups

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,090
in tech being an ally means supporting

00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:07,649
these people by following the tender for

00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:10,360
mentioned steps educating ourselves

00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:12,970
practicing empathy working on our

00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:16,450
humility working through our privileges

00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:18,880
and biases listening amplifying their

00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:23,590
voices working on diversity and

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,570
inclusion and by giving and by

00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:29,010
continuing to learn and work on

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:32,320
ourselves being an ally is ongoing work

00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,890
but as allies we can support the people

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,820
who are

00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:40,090
fighting to debug this industry this is

00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:46,990
what we need to do and we need to do it

00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:49,540
now the Cody riding today will soon be

00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,940
obsolete the software we're building

00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,820
today will already be outdated in a few

00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:57,820
weeks the bugs we're producing today

00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:01,960
will be fixed and the features we build

00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:03,430
will change again what we have now is a

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,690
chance to build something bigger

00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:09,550
something that lasts what we have now is

00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:13,000
the chance to debug the tech industry

00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:17,320
and make it a better system that is

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,630
about justice and equality this

00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,940
debugging is already happening and it

00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:24,220
can't be stopped it is the biggest

00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,640
challenge and the biggest task we have

00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:30,160
as people in tech right now now is the

00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,060
time for us to debug this industry and

00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,680
make technology a place for everyone

00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:40,320

00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:05,100
