Title: Oliver Joseph Ash: Building an Offline Page for theguardian.com - JSConf Budapest 2016
Publication date: 2016-06-15
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2016
Description: 
	You’re on a train to work and you open up the Guardian app on your phone. A tunnel surrounds you, but the app still works in very much the same way as it usually would—despite your lack of internet connection, you still get the full experience, only the content shown will be stale. If you tried the same for the Guardian website, however, it wouldn’t load at all. Native apps have long had the tools to deal with these situations, in order to deliver rich user experiences whatever the user’s situation may be. With service workers, the web is catching up. This talk will explain how Oliver used service workers to build an offline page for theguardian.com.
