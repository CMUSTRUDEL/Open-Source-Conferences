project nerd disco and there I met

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,440
Martin yeah and Tim actually inspired me

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,620
to do a talk at jazz come from the very

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,540
same spot right before the party one

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,030
year later and as you can see there are

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:59,269
hum he was my inspiration to do that and

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:01,670
this brings us to the next point it's

00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:03,530
like to make this picture complete with

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,900
Tim's picture on the back of my picture

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,820
can somebody please take a picture of us

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,590
to standing there please take out your

00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:16,120
phone and take some pictures we want

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,120
nuts eps level 2

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:27,739
you got it okay thank you alright so

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:32,680
let's go so yeah not one part 1 we will

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:36,440
start with some music and what is music

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:40,780
you can say the most simple explanation

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:45,680
is that music is organized sound and

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:51,230
this sound can come from everything like

00:03:45,680 --> 00:04:06,440
a voice or an instrument like the guitar

00:03:51,230 --> 00:04:11,019
or created digitally and Archer if you

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:14,659
have the sound and you create music it's

00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:18,470
called a sample if you use the music for

00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:21,019
something else and so what is the sample

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,240
a sample simply some part of the music

00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:27,110
that is record and you can use it so

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:31,310
example is recorded sound and you can

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:34,010
get a sample from everything like your

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,000
little puppy that's playing a saxophone

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:40,580
and you can record this if you like or

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,270
if you eat some flies of pizza and the

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,300
sound of you chewing it I'm gap that

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:49,699
might be awesome too awesome view that

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,340
surfing exploding volcano in his

00:04:49,699 --> 00:05:00,470
streaming hahaha what happen would be a

00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:05,120
nice sound too so yeah let's come to the

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:08,690
first demo we will use a microphone to

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:15,620
record a sample and this is the

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:17,510
microphone and i will switch to my the

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:22,430
microphone them and please change the

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:25,160

woohoo okay okay awesome so we can use

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,570
the microphone it's connected over USB

00:05:50,550 --> 00:06:00,210
to my pc and i'm using the Web Audio API

00:05:53,570 --> 00:06:03,630
to ya use the sound inputs and to record

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:08,580
some stuff and in this kind of demo we

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:12,000
need you to create some samples and yeah

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:15,210
the first thing might be likin ooh and

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,760
it will go like this I will put my hand

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:21,120
to the right and this is the signal for

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,430
Martin to push the record button I mean

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,810

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:49,440

and depth that's all I need from you

00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,780
guys and I think I have something else

00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,940
in mind Martin didn't you tell me you

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,700
beatbox when you were younger don't you

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:12,010
want to record something from it you

00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:32,800
would be nice okay just do your thing

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:37,150
Martin please Thank You Martin so what

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:40,510
you see on the screen is my very fancy

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:43,060
microphone recording demo and what it

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:46,720
does is when you push the record button

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:50,410
and the media stream API is used to

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,480
fetch the odd user input stream and when

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,540
I push the record button again it stops

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,180
and create some blog and you can

00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,640
download this blob as a WAV file and I

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:07,810
also create an audio element here so I

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:10,300
can replay it oh I will do this and I

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:14,620
can also download it and specify a name

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:17,560
and whatever sound what there was and if

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,910
I download I can download the wav file

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,930
and this is all happening in the browser

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:27,480
which is super awesome you should

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,480
applause me please welcome to the class

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:45,740
so the next demo to create a sample you

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:48,800
can also use the Web Audio API Oh what's

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,580
happening m in combination with a midi

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,910
controller to create sounds

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:58,730
programmatically and this is my awesome

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:03,650
synthesizer demo which looks completely

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:07,670
different and what's the design tag

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:10,700
super fancy thank you and what's

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:13,040
happening here is when I push the midi

00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:20,240
controller i show it to you one month 12

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:25,090
x 11 second please why is it so ok no no

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:39,740
problem if i push your money this short

00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:42,170
no it's because I hand push Alhassan so

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,090
what is Tim doing on stage you can't see

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:50,570
it right I push something but you comes

00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:53,480
here is it as shitty so I have a webcam

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:57,170
here and what I have here is a midi

00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:01,370
controller that is connected over USB to

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:05,930
my pc and because we have the web MIDI

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:09,620
API I can control any mini controller

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:13,970
with my browser and when I open the

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:20,750
console you can see my awesome debug

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:23,270
lock and when I push a key it sends some

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,180
kind of events to the browser which I

00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:28,880
can listen to and like like mouse down

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:32,390
and now as a puppy down and here exactly

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,220
exactly like this and you can push the

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,840
keys and create some sound in this case

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,330
i'm using the Web Audio API in

00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,730
combination with to obsess laterz to

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,610
create sound

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:49,120
I'm going to push another key you can

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:52,209
see that every key has a unique note so

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,230
I can trigger different sounds based on

00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:59,920
every key which is awesome and of course

00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:05,500
I have some canvas in the background to

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:09,850
create a zone but this yeah just for fun

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:19,170
and we could record this but i will show

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:19,170
you something later so the book

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,890
we have some samples now and what should

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,610
we do with the samples there is an

00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:36,710
awesome desktop app based on electron

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:40,230
that's called loop drop and Luke drop is

00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:44,120
created by Matt macaque and you can use

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:47,280
it to create electronic music life and

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:53,610
it's open source and you can find it on

00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:56,580
Luke GS com and I will show it to you

00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:05,030
now because I can't program stuff like

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:05,030
this myself and this is Luke drop and

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:12,090
what you see here is on the left side

00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:15,750
you can create setups and those setups

00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:21,450
you create you can create groups of

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:28,970
sounds or samples and I'm removing my

00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:28,970
awesome piano to show you something else

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:36,590
yeah I'm sorry but it will be happening

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,590
any second

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:55,640
so what I have here is what can now no

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:58,670
that's not what I want so now I am I

00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:04,640
have another midi controller as it's

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:07,790
also connected over USB and you can see

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,670
here I have some samples already in my

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,450
set and if i push a button like on the

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:29,090
on the piano i can create a sound for

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:32,780
example like this one ooh alright so and

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:37,060
now I will take my time to you get all

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:42,880
your samples and put it into your crop

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:51,160
but I will do this in the background and

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:51,160
now it's Martin Stern all right then Oh

00:14:51,280 --> 00:15:02,269
keep all the still connect up

00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:05,389
see oh this works well alright so my

00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:08,209
part was the light show and the first

00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:12,549
thing i did this at james caan for you

00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:17,209
last year um for the first time and I

00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:20,779
kind of extended on the idea but who few

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:24,249
walls at jazz comfy you last year are

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:26,899
not so many though for the rest of you

00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:30,829
just a quick and true what professional

00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:35,019
lighting is so um there is this one

00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:37,759
protocol named dmx512 and it's a

00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:40,039
actually it's the only protocol that is

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,649
used to control professional stage

00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:49,249
lighting and basically every piece of

00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:55,659
stage equipment what sorry we don't want

00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:59,839
you to event you okay um so DMX

00:15:55,659 --> 00:16:02,629
specifies just 512 channels hence the

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:07,759
name and each of those channels is just

00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:10,939
a single bite then you have DMX devices

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:15,229
which can be simple simple floodlights

00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:18,470
or even more advanced kind of lighting

00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:24,039
equipment and they can use up to any

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:24,039
number of channel to say oh sorry whoo

00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:29,279
hello ray

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:38,820
that's what that was offensive sorry

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:40,940
sorry really sorry okay um so each of

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,370
the issue is just these diseases can be

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,500
independently address and has a couple

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,430
number of channels for all sorts of

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:54,690
different functions like the color or

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:57,630
yeah you will see you can of course by

00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:00,029
such DMX USB interface but those are

00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,040
tend to be a really expensive so I built

00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:07,260
one my own out of a food container an

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:12,420
Arduino and some custom electronics that

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:15,959
the only cost 10 0 so really a the cheap

00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:21,120
way to go it's a live and it works quite

00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:24,750
well so and having our we know which

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:28,520
talks over serial port guy use beef I

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:33,809
can simply do this so i have a unsigned

00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:36,050
byte array 512 bytes long and if I now

00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:39,900
write that byte array to a serial port

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:44,280
that will get sent out as a DMX signal

00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:48,260
to all the devices here in the room so

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:51,540
um manipulating such a byte array is

00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:55,140
painful because DMX is a really weird

00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:57,780
protocol you can can't really keep track

00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,960
of what each of these channels does and

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:06,050
what the values mean so I started to

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:11,309
write interface for that I called 512

00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:13,440
which simply lets me use all this DMX

00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:17,820
stuff simply by setting properties on

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,280
objects so while writing that i found

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:28,800
out that objectifying property is really

00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:31,710
my friend but before I explain how opens

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,790
works just moving to this demo here so

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:38,040
um what

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:40,890
see maybe a zoom boot yeah like this so

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,080
what you see here is one of those

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,270
so-called moving hat spotlight so

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,050
there's in the middle here it's a

00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:51,180
regular spotlight but fancy one but

00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:53,130
basically just just lamp and it's

00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,280
mounted within that bracket and the

00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:59,130
bracket is mounted on that base and it

00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:03,060
has cell to degrees of freedom and I can

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:06,630
control them like this so i can adjust a

00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,730
tilt angle which is a rotation around

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,920
the x-axis and then there's the rotation

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:15,210
around the z axis which is called pan

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:20,970
and so this is this is how such a spot

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:24,690
like an basically move freely around so

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:27,450
now I'm this 512 library I've wrote is

00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:30,060
written in JavaScript and so it becomes

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,400
really easy to just put it in a browser

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,260
and open the web socket the WebSocket

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,350
talks to server the server talk to the

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:41,280
DMX interface sends out 512 bytes of

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:46,140
data so then I'll just open this console

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:50,880
here maybe quick reload just see it says

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:52,800
hi it's nice so I can interact with my

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,480
or maybe I should increase the font size

00:19:52,800 --> 00:20:00,150
good the bezel yeah all right so yes

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,450
there's this one object I named device

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:06,570
registry and this gives me access to all

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:11,460
the devices in a summer meaningful way

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:13,260
and I can now go ahead and select some

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,440
devices in this case I assigned to

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:20,240
variable name p and I want all the dot

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:23,250
profile so um what does this is it

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,010
selects all all the devices that I name

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:29,070
to profile from the selection of devices

00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:31,860
in this room and you can see those are

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:36,450
four of them and they are hanging right

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:39,049
up there the four lamps so um I can now

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:45,169
assign some values for

00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:48,619
pan and tools for instance so by moving

00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:52,970
into position but in order in order to

00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:56,149
light them up there are two things about

00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:58,999
these lands I have to open the shutter

00:20:56,149 --> 00:21:01,970
which shuts the beam off and Bess turn

00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:08,590
the light so additionally to the shutter

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:12,529
they also have a dimmer and so buses now

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:15,499
and really it's just a assignment of

00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:16,909
object property and I can just adjust

00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:21,549
the brightness a bit for you in the

00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:28,999
middle or maybe I can adjust the color

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:32,299
so back to full brightness a new a new

00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:34,239
thing accepts actually everything that

00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:37,279
will CSS classification allows at

00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:44,179
California's because those devices have

00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:46,940
a 48-bit color mixing unit so what else

00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:49,340
yeah of course um i would like to

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:52,309
animate them now but the problem is i

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,999
can type so fast just the panel values

00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:57,649
so now we have it on the browser right

00:21:55,999 --> 00:22:02,019
on the browser has a lot of awesome

00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:06,080
stuff for instance the gamepad api so um

00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:12,289
graph here this is a this is actually a

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:14,419
3d mouse a cold space navigator and it

00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:17,629
connects to the browser via the gamepad

00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:20,119
api showing 6 axis of freedom whether

00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:22,519
that i can adjust and i have rope some

00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:25,700
adapter for those this is called space

00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:28,489
enough pan tilt controls and i can now

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:34,480
just put the moving hats in there and

00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:37,160
hopefully is now I'm able to

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,640
just play around with them like this

00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,790
maybe not so much in the audience more

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,120
to the stage all right Tim how you're

00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:50,180
doing the samples are awesome i don't

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:54,170
know what i'm doing i try to fix them

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,520
somehow but yeah it's the one guy would

00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,230
shout that you have a script at the

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:06,950
wrong time thank you it's ruined

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:09,680
everything but ok so this is all this

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:12,050
all really really great and I could I

00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,620
could just really go ahead and program

00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:17,660
animations with these lamps and do all

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,390
kinds of awesome stuff with them but i

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,810
would have to write javascript and what

00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:26,420
about maybe if i want to do a light show

00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:28,520
I I would need to have a lot of

00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,880
different settings and I would need to

00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,100
be able to combine them like different

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,800
colors and different positions should be

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,360
you should be able to manage

00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:42,710
independently maybe I want something

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:46,010
like inheritance and yeah I actually

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:53,270
started trying to do this was with a big

00:23:46,010 --> 00:24:01,460
Jason fire but yeah turns out using CSS

00:23:53,270 --> 00:24:04,630
as a way better way to us oh oh oh wait

00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,630
I'm sorry

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:14,850
sorry

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,280
okay so this is what I ended up with

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:19,530
because all these all these object

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,200
properties that are already had can now

00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:25,289
be simply something written a CSS

00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,470
properties and I have the selection of

00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:30,929
devices which is upfront so i can I can

00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,000
just do the same that I just do it with

00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:35,460
open the shutter and set a color and set

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,450
the brightness panel tool values and

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:42,840
write this and CSS so um and this

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:45,559
actually is something that does work I

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:50,070
just need to this is a serial port

00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:55,799
communicating so what do i need to do i

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:58,140
need to start next demo here okay it's

00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,590
doing something let's see if it's the

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:07,370
right thing so this thing has a

00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:07,370
presentation mode right where is it ah

00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:18,450
does it doesn't matter um I will just do

00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:20,520
it like this okay so um what you're

00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:25,080
seeing here is a CSS file that was

00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:27,480
currently running in the room and just

00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,990
to prove this I actually implemented

00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:36,919
live reload um follow so i can now

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:36,919
adjust this what no like this

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:51,390
or maybe a bit more JavaScript of color

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:58,460
here or do some uneven on any way we can

00:25:51,390 --> 00:26:02,429
be we can put a color here whose ok so

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:05,010
all of this is working but yeah I'm the

00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:10,620
thing else I didn't actually do this

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:13,409
just for fun so um this is what I

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:17,039
actually did so i have to some i'm

00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:19,950
writing zas photos so i have to use

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:23,039
notes as to produce some CSS that i can

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:26,580
further use I used to rework passer to

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:30,990
take that fierce as a part and so I have

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:33,750
that AST and I then just implemented

00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:37,799
this aquarium get computed style for the

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:41,820
room which based on what I what I set as

00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:44,280
styles yeah but creates all the

00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:48,000
properties for every device and send

00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:51,330
some out over my DMX interface and the

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,799
next thing I'm going to show you is why

00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:58,919
I did this because i also have such a
