Description: 
	The way we interacted with computers on a large scale was stuck in place for roughly 20 years. From mouse to keyboard to joystick, it is game over. Today it is the era of gestures. Today’s gamers can do everything from slice and dice produce in Fruit Ninja to quest for a dragon in Skyrim. We’ve been captivated by these powerful, natural, and intuitive interactions; imagining what it would be like to have that power at our own fingertips.

In this recent decade, we’ve seen some staggering advances in technologies bring us closer making these magical experiences a reality. In this talk I will present how we can create new, intuitive, interactions for these novel input devices using JavaScript.
