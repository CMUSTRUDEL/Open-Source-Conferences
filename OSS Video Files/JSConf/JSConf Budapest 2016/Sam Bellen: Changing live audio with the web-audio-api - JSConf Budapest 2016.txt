Title: Sam Bellen: Changing live audio with the web-audio-api - JSConf Budapest 2016
Publication date: 2016-06-16
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2016
Description: 
	As a guitar player, I usually use some effect-pedals to change the sound of my guitar. I started wondering: “What if, it would be possible to recreate these pedals using the web-audio-api?”. Well, it turns out, it is entirely possible to do so.

This talk takes you through the basics of the web-audio-api and explains some of the audio-nodes I’ve used to change the live sound of my guitar.

hi so I'm changing live audio with the

00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,150
Web Audio API yes I'm going to talk

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,640
about today but first let me quickly

00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:20,349
introduce myself I'm some belem I'm a

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,210
front-end engineer it's made with love

00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:26,020
you can find me on the Internet as some

00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:28,300
me so I'm a guitar player I play guitar

00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,980
in my bedroom in my living room just at

00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,160
home and I have this collection of of

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,079
pedals to put effects on my guitar and I

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,059
got interested in how to display these

00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,879
pedals work how did these effects come

00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:42,239
to life so I started researching making

00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:45,100
the pedals myself with electronic

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,720
circuitry and stuff and then I got the

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,970
idea like a we have the Web Audio API

00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,430
maybe I can create this with just using

00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,920
javascript so that's what I try to do

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,590
and that's what today I will just try to

00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,480
explain how I did it and you'll get a

00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:02,739
live demo yeah first the first thing we

00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,899
need to do is get the sound of the

00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:06,579
guitar in the browser so you can hear it

00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:09,579
through the speaker and you can

00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:12,549
manipulate the sound of the guitar with

00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:14,409
the Web Audio API it's actually kind of

00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:16,869
simple first you create a new audio

00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:21,100
context which is the basics of the Web

00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:23,649
Audio API then you get the audio input

00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,229
of your computer so I just put the

00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:28,299
guitar as a microphone basically I

00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:30,759
connected it to my computer use

00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:34,929
navigated up guess it getusermedia and I

00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,459
can access the microphone this has been

00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:38,619
deprecated like this and it's been

00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:41,259
changed to navigator dot media devices

00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:43,929
don't get user media but it only works

00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:45,819
in Firefox and in chrome behind an

00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:49,990
experimental web platforms feature flag

00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:54,009
so for now I use the old version because

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,810
it's better supported and then basically

00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:58,029
we're almost done getting the sound of

00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,729
the guitar into the browser all you have

00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:02,229
to do is create an input nodes from the

00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,389
media stream we just cut from the

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:06,849
microphone off or from the guitar and

00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:09,270
connected to the audio context

00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:12,239
destination which is just the speaker's

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,470
that's step one I will demo this later

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,860
but basically that's all you have to do

00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,069
to just get the sound of your guitar in

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,090
your browser and

00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:25,189
you play guitar on the app step to add

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,319
effects to the guitar sound because

00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:30,200
that's what I wanted to do I just wanted

00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:34,040
to alter the sound you use some effects

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,739
and make some cool noise basically then

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,709
you have a few of different pedals which

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,840
you can find on most pedal boards the

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,239
most basic one is a volume pedal in

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,439
which with which you just can change the

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,329
volume of your guitar this is quite easy

00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,620
because in the Web Audio API you have

00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:54,349
something as the gain note which

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,689
controls the game or just the volume you

00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,459
can create one which is odd with just

00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:01,819
doing all your context or create game

00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:04,189
and then set the game which is usually

00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:07,159
between zero and one or zero percent and

00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:08,810
1 percent then you connect the input

00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,000
node to the gain nodes we gain out to

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,489
the audio context destination and you

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,310
have a chain of input gain and output

00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:19,909
and the gain in the middle will control

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:24,079
the volume of your signal signal I have

00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:26,629
a quick demo of how the gano it effects

00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:30,349
your audio waves this is just an audio

00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:34,519
wave of a fixed node but again out of

00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:36,319
100% so the volume is 100% if you change

00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,870
it to 50 you will see that the waves are

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,909
getting thinner if you put it bigger you

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,500
will see the way is get bigger but they

00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:45,079
get clipped on the top of the top and

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,840
the bottom that's basically how the gain

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:51,650
no it works it just decreases or

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,419
increases the gain of your signal this

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,819
is the audio chain I talked about if you

00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:58,609
just want to put a volume pedal on your

00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:00,199
guitar sound or on any input sounds this

00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:01,909
is what you have to do inputs do not

00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,479
gain out outputs

00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:08,900
done then the second one when you play

00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:11,540
guitar unless you play country music or

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,870
so you want to have this little bit

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,909
gnarly sounding guitar or metal rock

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,639
whatever doesn't matter you want it to

00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:21,530
be rough this is usually a distortion

00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,360
pedal or a first pedal or an overdrive

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,780
pedal does it really matter it's all

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,510
something that affects the waves of the

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,650
sound waves in a way that it sounds

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,440
rough

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,720
dirty doesn't matter

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,790
we can do this with a wave shaper note a

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,670
wave shaper note is basically just a

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,760
note that you can create and you can

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:46,420
give it a mouth curve and it will apply

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,360
this curve to your audio signal it's

00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:52,860
very complicated to calculate these

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,910
curves so there's one very good one on

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,070
stackoverflow there's a link in my

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,500
presentation if you want to see it it's

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:04,300
just a lot of math stuff which I don't

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:06,760
really understand but it works I can do

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,770
I can show you what it does because we

00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,060
have the basic inputs I'm single again

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,830
it's just the sine wave if you apply the

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,810
formula or the curves to this sine wave

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,340
you will see that it's suddenly becomes

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,140
a totally different way if it's get

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,510
chopped off at the bottom and at the top

00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:26,320
and this is what makes your sound

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:31,540
actually rough dirty proof you'll hear

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,520
this later as well one of if you want to

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,070
make it a single path it's just again

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,450
input wave shape or node output it's

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,860
always this simple you have the input

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,020
node you have the output which are the

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,830
speakers and in between you can just put

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,050
as many audio nodes as you want in this

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,380
case the volume and the distortion are

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:53,020
quite simple the next few examples will

00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,690
be a bit more nodes in between but the

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:59,170
basic stay the same inputs audio notes

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:01,330
other audio nodes outputs then a third

00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,790
pedal which you can commonly find on

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,370
guitar players or keyboard players or

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,050
whatever is a delay pedal a delay effect

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,150
is basically something that takes your

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,940
sound and repeats a few times while

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:16,540
failing out so you have this delayed

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,610
sounds after you play it to make this

00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:22,630
there's a delay nodes in the Web Audio

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:24,700
API it's the same we do audio context or

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:28,210
create delay you can say the delay value

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:31,090
in this case it's one second you connect

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:34,690
it from input to delay node to the

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:37,240
output you have a delay but in essence

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,940
until I know it just delays the sound

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,320
and it doesn't really repeat it so if

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,550
you want to really make the delay effect

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,820
of the you want to rig ATAR it's a bit

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,850
more

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,620
complicated it looks like this we

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,570
basically just send the delay it sounds

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,280
too gay no it's decrease its value send

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,560
it back to delay back and forth until

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,290
the gain or the gain is zero so the

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,310
volume is zero so it will stop repeating

00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:06,880
that way it fades out the next one is a

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:11,110
flanger pedal anger is a bit like a

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,630
delay but it has a dynamic time or

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,460
duration or speed of the delay so it's

00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,890
not going to repeat like pom pom pom but

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,100
it's going to be like a sine wave going

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,840
up and down fast and slow and to create

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,450
a sine wave if we can use an oscillator

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,600
note oscillator notes are basically just

00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:32,710
audio notes which create a sine wave or

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:37,930
a square wave just one big stone you can

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:40,720
use to make a synthesizer for example it

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,000
has a few values you can edit the most

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,820
important ones are type which is a sine

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,550
wave for a more a nice sine wave or a

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,800
square wave or a sawtooth wave or a

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,680
triangle wave and you can set the

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,520
frequency which is basically the tone of

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,020
your of your sounds if it's a height if

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,090
it's a high frequency it will be a very

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,180
high tone with a low frequency it will

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,820
be a very low tone you can put any

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,520
number you want but humans usually can

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,920
just hear that the frequency is between

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,200
20 and 20 thousands but if you want to

00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,940
annoy your dog just put it on five you

00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:22,360
will hear it you will not you will not

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:24,100
be happy I will here you can see and

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,890
also they don't know it by default it's

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,440
a sine wave which is just a sine wave if

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,770
you make it a square wave it's something

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,090
else

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:36,219
triangle wave sawtooth that's all

00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,530
something else and then you can control

00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:41,080
the Hertz which you will see it goes

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:44,020
faster and faster the higher the the

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:48,250
Hertz go and I can annoy you and let you

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:50,950
listen to the sound which is kinda

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,320
annoying but that's what is what an

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:56,650
oscillator does it just creates one one

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,899
sounds that just continues to be

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,490
annoying

00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:04,459
one of the cool things though is that an

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:07,130
oscillator note it creates a wave so if

00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:09,410
you want to create a dynamic delay like

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,990
in a flanger you can just create the

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,300
wave of the oscillator to the delay time

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,279
the delay note we saw earlier which you

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,440
can set the time so it will just go up

00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:20,720
and down constantly depending on the

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,769
speed of your oscillator so the delay

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,800
will be dynamic a.k.a flanger basic

00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:31,430
flanger then the last pedal I want to

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,820
talk about is a reverb pedal a reverb

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,680
effect is usually a bit of eco

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,370
atmosphere behind the sound of your

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:43,519
guitar or your keyboard or whatever

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:46,540
instrument you want to play and we can

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,100
do this with using a convo over note

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,529
it's a bit more difficult because you

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,260
have to load an impulse response file

00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:56,839
then get an array buffer out of it and

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,600
then decode the audio data and put it as

00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,920
a buffer of the controller nodes and

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,440
basically what this will do is an

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,110
impulse impulse response file is just a

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,149
file with characteristics like is a big

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,370
room it has some echo that

00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,959
characteristics are in that file and the

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,209
convolve inaudible projects these

00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:18,260
characteristics on the sounds you're

00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:20,450
making so on my guitar I didn't make

00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,550
this impulse response file myself but

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,920
I'm Chris Wilson has the Webber the

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,410
playground which has a very few very

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,740
good example or a few good examples

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,140
actually and then if you want to make

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,209
the effect it's also just a few notes

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,570
together with the convo over notes and

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:43,100
you get the the effect you want the

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,600
river actually so there are a lot a lot

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,550
of other notes I'm not going to talk

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,890
about all of them you have and as

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:52,190
analyzer note which just analyzes your

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,560
auto audio and you can get data like

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,089
frequency or stuff like in the first

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,730
slide I add the wave which you could see

00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:01,190
it was just an analyzer node analyzing

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,959
my microphone if a big quad filter note

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,510
which is just to filter some frequencies

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,630
channels better and merger shell split

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,970
channels from stereo to mono or the

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,340
other way around I don't know to go from

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,760
left

00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,560
right or if you have a seven points one

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,500
Dolby Surround system or something to

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,530
just position the audio inside a space

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,390
which can be 3d and you can use a

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,370
paranoid for that or a dynamics

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,520
compressor not-it's just to compress

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,080
audio and I'll go do it go into details

00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,420
of these because they're cool but

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:38,250
they're not necessary for my

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,720
demonstration then it's cool that you

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,460
can create all these things but as

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,470
you've seen some of these effects are a

00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,850
little bit complicated you have the

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,420
schemes and if all the notes working

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:51,360
together so I started building a library

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,360
where you can just create easy audio

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,910
effects it's kind of working

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,560
I used it there's still a lot for it to

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,800
do if somebody's interested you can

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,870
still help me or give feedback whatever

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,300
you want but basically it works like

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,310
this you want to have an input you want

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,230
the distortion or delay effect import it

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,330
create a new distortion or delay effect

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,540
and chain it all together that's all you

00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:18,930
have to do so I'm quite happy with the

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:21,110
results already and now let's see if it

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,110
works

00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,750
I'm not really good and playing guitar

00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:47,040
in front of people but we'll see I've

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:49,500
made this small application on top of

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,410
this library I was I am building which

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,890
is just an interface to create the

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:59,399
effect notes first off you start by

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:03,270
creating an input node and let me see if

00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,760
it's going to use my guitar yep if you

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,910
this is just now going from the input my

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,709
microphone to the output the speakers

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,800
which will just let you listen to the

00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:16,860
guitar it's nothing effect yeah there's

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,230
no effect yet it's just input output

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,550
guitar but then you can start adding

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:26,810
effects like volume pedal which is now

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:30,670
the full volume but you can put

00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:37,940
unless to create just control the volume

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:47,089
next up we have distortion it will just

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:49,730
make your guitar sound super badass the

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:54,610
next one is the delay effects I'm going

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:54,610
to put it a little bit faster so you can

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,080
just keep some going and fades out

00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,850
eventually you can still control the

00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,220
parameters but that's something you can

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,500
play with for hours and hours so I'm not

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:21,650
going to do this next up is the flanger

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,560
let me switch off the delay turn these

00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:27,110
on because it's badass and then this is

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:33,500
the dynamic delay which goes faster and

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:39,080
slower waving sound in the audio that's

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:46,360
the flanger and then last the reverb

00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:46,360
effect in the background

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,480
so we had this is basically just using

00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:03,850
javascript to control the sound of my

00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:06,130
guitar pretty cool Danny we're not

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,540
finished yet what if you have our hands

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,250
of not view if you don't have our hands

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,290
available to control the mouse because I

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,180
have my left hand on the guitar my right

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,310
hand on the pig but I want to switch

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,320
between effects and stuff there's

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:20,260
something called about MIDI API which

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,470
we've seen yesterday night it was very

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,870
cool so I've tried to integrate it with

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,720
this little app I have so I can just use

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:32,200
my feet to control the switching on and

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,620
off of the effects what I did is I built

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:38,830
this stuff which is just a piece of

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:44,590
aluminum with some switches and a Tesla

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:47,200
inside it it looks like the schematic is

00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:49,680
roughly this hardware is just buttons

00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,690
then they connect to the tassel which

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,180
has a socket connection to a server

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,940
running on my laptop which just converts

00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:01,330
the signal to a MIDI signal basically I

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,880
wanted to put do to create a MIDI signal

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:06,460
on my Tesla but it doesn't support it

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:09,880
yet because the node libraries are just

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:12,010
bindings to the native core MIDI or the

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,350
windows engine experience so now I'm

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:18,790
just having a socket connection between

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:21,870
my laptop and my my pedals and hopefully

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:26,980
they will work because yeah Internet

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:28,870
network other web MIDI API is very

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,020
simple you just request MIDI access you

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,280
get a list of devices and then you

00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,750
basically just choose the device you

00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,850
want in this example I take the first

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:42,880
one but they have name so you can just

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:45,480
search for the name of your device let's

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,480
see if it works

00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:54,399
I just turned off my inputs which is

00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:54,399
nice I can just

00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:05,159
all of the effects on my pedalboard

00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:07,079
which is me you can you can just buy me

00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:10,189
the pedals and use it but where's the

00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:15,620
fun and that's just created yourself and

00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:15,620
this is the end of the presentation

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:27,720
thank you if any of you guys are

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,490
interested if a few project and get up

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,960
which is the audio effects library or

00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,970
the pedal board the little app you saw

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,340
the oscilloscope which is to create the

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:46,830
waves visually and my presentation is

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:51,179
also in get up so thank you I'm a bit

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:52,490
early so maybe questions is somebody

00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,779
else who wants to come and play this

00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:57,120
week we could do a Q&A or you could just

00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,519
do it like a concert you know why that's

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,340
not going to happen they won't have any

00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,639
questions I'll bring the microphone to

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:09,480
you

00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:12,600
hopefully it's not gonna feedback hi

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,110
awesome presentation thank you how's the

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,440
latency it's sometimes really bad

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,299
sometimes super good it's depends on the

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,279
amount of tops fear you're running in

00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,590
your Chrome or in whichever bus you're

00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:29,639
using I found out that using Chrome has

00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:32,159
the best audio that's because in Firefox

00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:34,110
you have this annoying sound in the

00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,299
background but Firefox does have very

00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,809
cool developer tools to debug your audio

00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:42,240
chain so I just use them to develop I

00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:44,460
use the Firefox and Chrome just to

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,470
listen to it but yeah the latency like

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,230
you asked is just depends on your

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,840
computer on your tabs on the amount of

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,610
effects you put together that kind of

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,340
stuff all right thank you cannot do

00:18:53,610 --> 00:19:01,820
superfast solos because you'll hear it a

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,820
bit later okay

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,650
hottest one

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,900
I want an extended demo please it was so

00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,090
short please show us the pedal again

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:33,290
that was so nice I want to get a video

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:38,240
please just do something with the guitar

00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:40,420
and use the pedal please that's my

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,420
question

00:19:47,140 --> 00:20:00,590
I'm very happy is for questions so what

00:19:53,300 --> 00:20:03,710
do you want to hear let's just create

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:07,760
some dirty stuff does anybody know where

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:10,630
a nice riff or something that's not a

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,630
riff that the whole song

00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:30,700
quite hard because create a lot of cool

00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,900
sounds and just play around with the

00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,130
stuff let's see what we get for maybe we

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:48,669
get noise maybe we get something very

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:51,250
funky I really love flanger by its

00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:55,320
sister makes everything seems like it's

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:59,919
a psychedelic rock band was playing then

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:04,090
