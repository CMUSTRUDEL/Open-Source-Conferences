Description: 
	As a guitar player, I usually use some effect-pedals to change the sound of my guitar. I started wondering: “What if, it would be possible to recreate these pedals using the web-audio-api?”. Well, it turns out, it is entirely possible to do so.

This talk takes you through the basics of the web-audio-api and explains some of the audio-nodes I’ve used to change the live sound of my guitar.
