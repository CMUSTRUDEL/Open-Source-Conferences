Title: Denys Mishunov: Why Performance Matters - JSConf Budapest 201
Publication date: 2016-06-09
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2016
Description: 
	Load a page in less than a second; reduce the number of server requests; keep your CSS and JS merged and compressed to keep them under 50 kilobytes” – these are just a few among technical solutions and recommendations we are getting in the industry to tackle performance issues. But there is one catch – your users don’t care about absolute values in kilobytes, milliseconds and number of requests.

Performance is not about Mathematics. Performance is about Perception. Perception is what makes a site with a very few requests nevertheless feel slow, while a site that delivers search results during tens of seconds can feel fast enough for your user. User’s perception of your website’s speed is the only true performance measure.

This talk is about perception, neuroscience and psychology. The time is ripe to understand performance from the user’s perspective.

so yes more often than not what somebody

00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:18,560
says performance we tend to think about

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:21,739
speed but even though be not exactly the

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,970
same this substitution has a really good

00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:27,500
background in forms of statistics for

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,599
example warmer dhadkan figured out that

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,369
one second of performance improvement

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,550
will give them two percent higher

00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:36,879
conversions rate doesn't sound that much

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,850
but we are talking about company with

00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:42,140
482 billion u.s. dollars in revenue and

00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,989
let me tell you that two percent of this

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,809
number can buy you ten countries like

00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:50,890
samoa islands that's quite a lot of

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:53,179
money another perspective on performance

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,749
recently designed by financial times

00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:59,359
revealed that one second group in

00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:02,629
performance will leave them without four

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,479
point six percent of conversions drop in

00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:07,670
two seconds will leave them without five

00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,610
percent of conversions and three seconds

00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,220
of losing performance would steal almost

00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:17,270
eight percent of conversions rate from

00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,910
them that's a lot of users but probably

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,290
the best perspective on performance gave

00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,210
Wikipedia last year when they were

00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,070
searching for what performance engineer

00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,560
they simply calculated the number of

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:31,220
readers that wikipedia has and put it

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,890
this way that by cutting page load by

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:38,240
100 milliseconds you would say Wikipedia

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:41,930
readers 617 years of weight annually

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:46,520
this is quite unexpected but very

00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:50,060
illustrative case of what is performance

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:53,570
these statistics answers the question

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:57,970
why performance matters users buy more

00:01:53,570 --> 00:02:00,740
users click more users download more and

00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,270
that's pretty much all I wanted to tell

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,670
you about why performance better today

00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:10,580
thank you well you didn't think that I

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,010
would leave just like that idea huh if

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,769
things are that simple why do we keep

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,280
talking about this performance thing and

00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:24,800
if performance is solely about speed

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:28,730
then how do we explain this this is

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,870
statistics for gizmodo com and if you

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:36,410
get to the numbers well that's quite

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,930
shocking load time almost 20 seconds

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:43,040
visually complete 20 seconds and this is

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,330
on the cable connection there has to be

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,520
something wrong with these statistics

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,010
because gizmodo.com is the site that

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,640
during the last 30 days gained more than

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:58,239
33 million unique users and more than

00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,680
112 million views ok statistics apart

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:06,470
let's see how this side behaves in the

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:09,650
real browser we type in URL and this

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:13,880
side is almost instantly here where are

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:18,320
those 20 seconds huh we'll get back to

00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:20,540
this example a bit later but to those of

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,000
you who still think that performance is

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,640
about milliseconds kilobytes number of

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,390
servers sorry requests I haven't used

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,070
for you performance is not about

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:37,160
mathematics performance is about

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,769
perception and that's why today I'm not

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,750
going to tell you how to supercharge

00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:44,780
superpower your page loading time by

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,269
using some fancy tools and techniques

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,730
like service worker because well nobody

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:57,200
can tell you this better than Jake hello

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:58,700
I'm Jake hello Jake instead I will give

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,600
you a different perspective on what we

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,940
call performance and in this journey

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,680
today will employ the most powerful and

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:12,620
interesting tool that we have at our

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:14,810
disposal our brain have you ever had

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,030
this experience when you spend days

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,160
weeks working on your performance

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:22,220
optimization strategy you deploy

00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:26,510
everything but neither your customer nor

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:29,180
your boss notices any difference you

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,190
know that times are lower you know that

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,940
performance optimization works but your

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:37,550
users

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:40,850
well your users just don't care in 19th

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,310
century German psychologist and that but

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:47,450
and later his student Gustav Fafnir

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:49,990
postulated a law that surprisingly

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:54,710
enough they called better faster law

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:58,100
this law defines a value called just

00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,510
noticeable difference this is minimal

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,880
noticeable difference between two

00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:04,460
stimuli like power difference in power

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,030
difference in power of light and time is

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,730
no exception to this law but experience

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,280
and research show that for the short

00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,540
periods of time of up to 30 seconds and

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,160
these are other times that we are

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,710
particularly interested in when we talk

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,690
about the web development Weber

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,260
factional law can be replaced with

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,840
simple twenty percent rule why am I

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:31,460
talking about this and what does it have

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,750
to do with us web developers well let's

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,430
assume you have an event that your

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,190
customer is not satisfied with for

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:41,240
example page loading time so in order

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,680
for your customer to just notice the

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,360
difference after your performance

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,720
optimizations you make you have to make

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,620
your page loading at least twenty

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,620
percent faster anything below that will

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:58,580
make your users thinking oh well I don't

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:01,250
see any difference there is one catch

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:04,160
though we are talking about noticeable

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:09,770
difference and noticeable does not

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,630
necessarily mean meaningful if you still

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,910
think that twenty percent is more than

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,910
enough to spot the difference then I

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:20,720
have another example for you i will show

00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:23,150
you two versions of the same page while

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,690
without optimization and one with

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:31,190
optimization your task is to spot which

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:40,669
one is faster are you ready are you

00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:43,270
ready great site number one site number

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:43,270
two

00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:54,220
who thinks that site number one was

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:58,600
faster okay who thinks that site number

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,950
two was faster wonderful who thinks that

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:08,140
this is matrix and this side doesn't

00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:09,940
exist that's correct you see that there

00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,710
are people who think that first option

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,440
is faster and there are people who think

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:17,170
that the second option is faster

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,440
technically there is no correct answer

00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:23,680
but if we check the numbers the first

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,140
one was load was taking 1.6 seconds to

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,230
load and the second one used two seconds

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:33,700
to load and majority of you told that

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:37,810
second option is faster do you still

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,490
believe in absolute numbers in this

00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,140
example we are talking not about 50

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,310
milliseconds difference not hundred

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:47,220
milliseconds difference we are talking

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:49,990
about 400 milliseconds of difference and

00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,480
if you still think that we can blindly

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:57,930
rely on absolute numbers here is my

00:07:52,480 --> 00:08:01,420
second example to you hello I'm Jake

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:03,850
sorry Jake I just couldn't resist but

00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,220
for some tennis I hope that all of you

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,440
have wonderful content so far and my

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,840
voice doesn't make things worse even

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,660
though I deliberately delayed the audio

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,390
on this clip by 100 milliseconds just

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,250
won't notice anyway is our brain is

00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,750
really good at synchronizing the

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,500
information it gets from five of our

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:26,410
senses into one consistent perception to

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,350
compensate for any delays unless the

00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,510
delays become is proportionate and in

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:37,290
this case we experience this annoying

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:40,290
out of sync video your turn buddy yeah

00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,290
so

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:54,329
thank you that is thank you our brain is

00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:58,230
cheating us our brain does not allow us

00:08:54,329 --> 00:09:00,089
to rely on absolute numbers now remember

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,430
all those days and weeks you've spent on

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:07,560
your performance optimization strategies

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:09,300
to just shave off 50 milliseconds your

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,610
users just don't notice of course one

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,529
can argue that it is milliseconds there

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,529
and 15 more seconds there in total can

00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:19,860
give quite significant defaults

00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:21,540
improvement and I do agree the problem

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,760
is that all of these performance

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,190
optimizations require development time

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,970
that your users might not be willing to

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:32,250
give you so far what I'm talking about

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:37,620
today is quite depressed if isn't their

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:42,500
time but you know what let's try to turn

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:45,269
our depression into the opportunities

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,329
since we're talking about performance

00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:50,760
and perception let's figure out how our

00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:55,110
brain perceives time and in particular

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,420
how brain perceives wait first of all

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:01,260
pretty much any event consists of two

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:03,660
phases active phase and passive phase at

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,720
the phase is characterized by mental

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,790
activity it can be mental activity of

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,589
any kind like pure mental activity or

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,230
mental activity related to some physical

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:16,829
activity but the point is your brain is

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:19,620
busy on the other hand the passive phase

00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:22,230
is characterized by idling your brain is

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:27,329
no other option rather than just sit and

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:31,319
wait well you sit on brain wait using

00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:33,420
some techniques we can manipulate this

00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:36,149
balance between active phase and passive

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,519
phase in order to deliver different

00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:42,000
perception to the user why do we need to

00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,269
do this because when users complain to

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,040
you that something takes too long most

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,290
probably related to the passive phase

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,510
because active phase duties mental

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,029
activity is not considered away at all

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,139
by the brain so our task as the

00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,420
developers is too

00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:00,600
boys and techniques to reduce this

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:07,980
passive face by increasing the active

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:10,230
phase of the ways frankly I feel myself

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:14,069
a bit uncomfortable standing on this

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:19,799
stage and talking to such a brilliant

00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:22,919
audience about such simple things but

00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:26,819
when it comes to performance perception

00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:29,779
and brain it is really that simple is

00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:32,910
really that simple to trick our brain

00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,439
let's get to some techniques there are

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,790
multiple techniques to manage this

00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:40,379
balance between active and passive face

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:42,209
but of them boiled to two most common

00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:45,239
ones the first one being pre-emptive

00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:48,299
start let's assume you have an event

00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:51,779
that you want to make your user perceive

00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:54,959
as a shorter one in the pre-emptive

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:57,929
start technique in the beginning of our

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:01,350
event we put the active face so that

00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:03,919
user perceives this wait this event as

00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,449
the shorter one just this blue part

00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,949
let's get to the example and I will

00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:12,689
begin with the offline example that I

00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:14,939
will never get tired of in 2009

00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:16,829
adminstration of Houston Airport started

00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:20,549
getting an enormous amount of complaints

00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:22,379
on the lawn damage handling time well

00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:25,499
administration decided to help

00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:27,959
passengers and increase the number of

00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:30,059
stuff on the baggage handling line that

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,519
we use the overall time of the baggage

00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:34,889
handling 28 minutes everybody who

00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,660
travels a lot knows that the time from

00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:38,600
you from the moment you leave the plane

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,529
to the time you get your bag on the belt

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,049
eight minutes is really really low

00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:47,339
surprisingly enough the administration

00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:49,739
didn't notice any decrease in the

00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,660
complaints so they started investigating

00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:53,939
this case a bit deeper and they figured

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,470
out that indeed baggage handling time is

00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,600
eight minutes but the problem is that

00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,399
for an average person to get from the

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,709
plane to the baggage carousel it takes

00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,149
only one minute the remaining seven

00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,189
minutes the person just stands by the

00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,130
carousel and waits for his back to show

00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:10,280
up

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:13,220
employing the perception management

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,990
technique administration came up with a

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,050
very simple trivial but nevertheless

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,610
very effective solution what they did

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:23,150
they just started routing the arrival

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,220
planes to the gates further from the

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,380
baggage carousel that led to the

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,840
situation when an average person now

00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,360
needed six minutes to get from the plane

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,510
to the baggage carousel and only two

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:39,110
minutes just stand and wait so six

00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:42,170
minutes of active way and only two

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:45,520
minutes of passive way guess what the

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,520
number of complaints drop to zero

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:52,090
another example Mobile Safari on iOS I

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,530
guess this feature called blue top hits

00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:58,310
that is enabled by default in the iOS

00:13:54,530 --> 00:14:00,830
how it works so you open the browser you

00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:05,390
start typing the URL there are two

00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:08,030
things to note here first one title top

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,380
hit so based on your history on the

00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,720
history of your visits it's probably

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:15,020
tries to guess which side you want to

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:18,050
visit now quite trivial operation but

00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,930
there is another thing to note here the

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:24,170
network activity so what happens in this

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:26,780
moment once the party shows you the top

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:30,080
heat side in the background it also

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,940
tries to preload this site for you at

00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,460
the same time you type in URL so that

00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,980
when you're done with the URL the site

00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,290
is almost instantly here you don't spend

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,200
time waiting for all the assets to be

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,730
downloaded another example of

00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,290
pre-emptive star technique is the site

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,300
that I'm working with you never know and

00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:51,380
one of the things that we do good is

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:54,350
selling the main names obviously enough

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,870
there has to be the search page for the

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,870
domains and it works as any other domain

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:03,920
search page in the wild users just type

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:06,890
in the domain name click go and they get

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,980
the results with the domains the point

00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:13,280
is that to get to build these three of

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,589
domains we need to make an API call that

00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,060
for some technical reasons cannot be

00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:18,740
stored on the client and cannot be

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,750
cashed we have different prices

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,510
different till these and it all

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,880
dynamic and this API call is not the

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:29,360
fastest call in the world nevertheless

00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:33,110
we don't feel like our users have to be

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,630
penalized for this so we start making

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,390
the API call and pre-loading all the

00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,460
results and pre building the Dom tree at

00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:43,490
the moment the user hits the search page

00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,950
so user comes to the search page types

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,110
in the domain name and we already have

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:51,320
all the don't rebuilt in the background

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,270
so far so good but there are moments

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,940
when users can search for the domain

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:58,820
from another side sorry from another

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,620
page where he didn't hit the search page

00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,250
obviously enough he doesn't have the

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:06,020
search assets yet like for example on

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,690
the front page if you load the front

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,700
page you check a network tab and you see

00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,140
that there are no search related assets

00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,060
download it because you're not on the

00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,320
search page but let's see what happens

00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:20,840
when the user focuses on the search

00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:22,580
field once the user is focused in the

00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,590
search field we by default we assume

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,420
that the next step the next page he will

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,940
hit will be the search results page

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,640
that's why we needed we start

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:34,100
downloading the search assets make the

00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,170
API call and start rebuilding the Dom

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,339
tree right here on the front page before

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:42,170
user hits the Go button to deliver these

00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:46,150
search results as soon as possible when

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:49,310
he gets to the search page this is about

00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:52,520
preemptive star technique another one is

00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:54,500
called early completion where we have

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,780
the same event that we want user to

00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,310
perceive a shorter one but this time we

00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:03,800
put active phase at the end of the event

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,630
most probably the most obvious examples

00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,490
of this technique is pretty much any

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,890
video streaming services like YouTube

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:13,220
for example it all starts with a passive

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:15,319
phase users get to this side click the

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,150
play button and they wait for the video

00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:22,699
to be downloaded so the original event

00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:26,000
is full video to be downloaded but users

00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:28,100
do not wait until the full video gets to

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,750
their browser in the passive face all

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:33,760
the time once the first chunk of the

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:37,940
video possible for viewing is downloaded

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,340
the video begins and user is immediately

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,860
triggered into the active phase because

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,870
his brain is busy with mental activity

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,370
analyzing the visual information on his

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:50,540
screen even though the original event

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:52,790
keeps going in the background let's get

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,280
to our gizmodo example and see whether

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:58,010
where do they hide this 20 seconds that

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,260
we lost if you check the film strip of

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:04,360
rendering process of this side we will

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:07,460
notice that gizmodo starts rendering the

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,190
elements as soon as 1.5 seconds actually

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:14,960
a bit earlier but you're to the scale

00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:18,020
here and this is the critical moment up

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,300
until their users are in the passive

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:24,620
phase they have not no other option

00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:27,860
rather than just wait but once the side

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,570
starts rendering the things the brain is

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,940
triggered into the mental activity this

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,720
means that user is in active phase and

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,550
he doesn't mind and he doesn't care how

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,180
long does it take after this point

00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:43,340
whether it's 30 seconds 40 seconds to

00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,350
load the rest of the site he already has

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:52,910
information to consume he can start

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:59,840
reading today do not get me wrong i do

00:18:52,910 --> 00:19:04,460
not advocate for ignoring the the

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,680
industrial standards I just tell you

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,920
that when users are in passive face

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,830
they're very sad seriously we are we all

00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:16,670
hate waiting and this is the sweet spot

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:20,600
where we want to put our users as soon

00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:23,600
as possible and as i said i do not

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,660
advocate for ignoring industry standards

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:32,210
industry advices on absolute numbers and

00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:35,030
all the things because frankly all even

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,830
though i'm telling about perception all

00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:40,160
these perception techniques are driven

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:43,820
with technical means so in order to

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,669
employ all of this we still have to load

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,100
our assets as synchronously we should

00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:51,950
block rendering we should still keep

00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:55,639
compressing oh here comes a sink of

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:58,429
course async comes whenever it wants we

00:19:55,639 --> 00:20:04,039
should keep word using workers like

00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:08,600
service workers hi Jake we should keep

00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:10,519
using resource hints to preload prefetch

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,869
resources that we will need on other

00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:20,239
pages of our side but instead what I'm

00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:21,590
advocating for today is next time you're

00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:24,590
working on your performance optimization

00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,690
strategy to use the most powerful and

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:30,109
interesting tool available at our

00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:33,169
disposal being our brain and ask

00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:39,529
yourself a question is there any other

00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:42,859
way to do this and I couldn't finish my

00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:46,159
talk better than the quote by Apple in

00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:49,399
their basic performance tips that's as

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,999
the perception of performance is just as

00:20:49,399 --> 00:21:03,590
effective as actual performance in many

00:20:52,999 --> 00:21:05,749
cases thank you yes I hope I hope my

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,909
talk didn't keep you in passive wait but

00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:11,749
we are looking forward to the active

00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:13,970
phase that is being lunch so that

00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:17,239
question disposed because I cuz I got a

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:20,090
microphone okay so when you're which you

00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:21,559
show content on the screen that is isn't

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,659
currently active with JavaScript like

00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:25,820
would you add stuff visually that isn't

00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:28,279
yet clickable and how do you sort of

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:31,309
cope with that sort of thing so these

00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:33,169
stuff that is not clickable is probably

00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:34,759
it depends on the amount of this stuff

00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:36,739
if this is the only one button on the

00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:38,179
screen obviously users will try to click

00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:40,299
it and will be disappointed today's I'm

00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,919
clickable but if you have another

00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,950
information to consume to give user to

00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:48,440
consume then I think that it's totally

00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:50,059
fine to add this element uncle' well

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,509
maybe with some tool tip or something

00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:56,960
that says that yeah okay some more thing

00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:58,549
is coming but probably you should you

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,559
know I when it comes to performance

00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:03,019
every case is quite separate so

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,509
you have to analyze and you have user

00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:08,720
testing whether it works for them or not

00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:10,850
but it I would I would not mind putting

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,710
the unbelievable element on the screen

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,960
as soon as possible as long as the

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:17,330
functionality comes make sense thank you

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,730
very much so yes this now takes it to

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:22,509
lunch time lunch is just upstairs if you

00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,509
