Publication date: 2016-06-09
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2016
Description: 
	Load a page in less than a second; reduce the number of server requests; keep your CSS and JS merged and compressed to keep them under 50 kilobytes” – these are just a few among technical solutions and recommendations we are getting in the industry to tackle performance issues. But there is one catch – your users don’t care about absolute values in kilobytes, milliseconds and number of requests.

Performance is not about Mathematics. Performance is about Perception. Perception is what makes a site with a very few requests nevertheless feel slow, while a site that delivers search results during tens of seconds can feel fast enough for your user. User’s perception of your website’s speed is the only true performance measure.

This talk is about perception, neuroscience and psychology. The time is ripe to understand performance from the user’s perspective.
