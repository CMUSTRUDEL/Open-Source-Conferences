Title: Rachel White: Internet of Cats - JSConf Budapest 2016
Publication date: 2016-06-13
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2016
Description: 
	Ever lose out on a good night's rest because your pesky cats keep waking you up at 4am for food? Rachel has. Many times. For her first project using node, socket.io, microcontrollers, and johnny-five, Rachel built a web-based feeder that delivers tasty cat chow on a configurable schedule or when triggered remotely. She'll walk you through her learning process and get you excited about trying new things in your own projects. Finally, she'll show you how to take the first steps to release your work to the open source community.

hello

00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:18,020
I forgot to turn my screensaver off so

00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:20,300
give me a second yay okay so I'm here

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:24,860
today to talk to you about the Internet

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,690
of cats or trying new things is scary my

00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,060
name is Rachel white I'm oh ho on

00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,330
Twitter I'm a front-end engineer at IBM

00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:37,699
Watson and I live in New York so let's

00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:39,500
go this is me I love cats it might be

00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:42,830
hard to see I can't see that screen

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,589
right now but um this is in Tokyo last

00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,170
fall at a cat cafe and I am covered in

00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:50,089
about eight different cats that just so

00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,040
happened to blend in with the couch it

00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:56,299
was one of the happiest moments of my

00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:59,449
life and I I've always kind of liked

00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:01,940
cats and tried to have ideas of like how

00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:05,960
can I incorporate cats into technology

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,000
um but trying new things is scary and

00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,430
I'm mostly a front-end person like I

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,380
don't do hardware for my job I don't

00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,670
really do back end except now because

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,460
they're making me and I can't really

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,590
argue with them um so I was like okay

00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,460
how am I going to put this together and

00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:25,970
I decided to think of ways that I could

00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,410
try something new the ways that I think

00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,540
that trying things that are new or scary

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,370
is like you're trying something new from

00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,260
the beginning it's a totally new project

00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,170
you don't know how it's going to turn

00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,620
out maybe it'll suck maybe nobody like

00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,790
it maybe it won't even work who knows

00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,610
using new technologies for the first

00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,170
time is always scary to like you don't

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,820
know if all the documentation is there

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,530
you don't know if people are going to be

00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,630
there to be available to help you out

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,140
you just you don't really know what's

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,090
going to happen also scary is

00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,340
contributing to open source in general

00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,940
and I knew that I wanted to contribute

00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:04,010
an open source but I was afraid of all

00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,530
of the negativity around close

00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,500
communities and stuff and I was like how

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,050
am I going to do this pretty much like

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:16,099
putting yourself out there in general is

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:19,730
pretty terrifying let's talk about why

00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:22,470
it's scary for a little bit um like I

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,510
said you know maybe people laid it

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,580
maybe they won't like your project maybe

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,170
they'll think your code sucks maybe

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,250
they'll think you're stupid if they're

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,870
jerks and think that that matters

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,970
imposter syndrome sucks like are you

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,520
even good enough to finish this project

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,570
like will you be able to handle the code

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,930
if it's something that you're not

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:45,060
particularly familiar with and the

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,330
inclusiveness of communities I see this

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,880
happen more with smaller projects that

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,040
have a certain amount of contributors

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,770
that have always been contributing to it

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,900
and if somebody comes in and wants to

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:02,240
change something sometimes I'll just get

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:06,630
ignored or sometimes people just will be

00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,820
be very receptive to the feedback a bad

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,520
behavior in open source in general and

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,380
in tech I've seen a lot of people on

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,120
github lately that are just the

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,250
equivalent of a Twitter egg where

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,280
they're anonymous they don't provide

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,170
anything really productive other than

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,720
complaining about terminology code

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,160
conducts that kind of stuff which gets

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,769
me into people complaining about code of

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,050
conducts existing which if you're a good

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:34,680
person you shouldn't complain about that

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:37,050
obviously um so some examples of bad

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,480
behavior that I've seen our feigned

00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:42,150
ignorance uh which is I've encountered

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,980
in jobs before where instead of giving

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,330
constructive criticism if something

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,730
doesn't if somebody doesn't know

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,650
something that you just go oh you didn't

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,299
know about this like you should have

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,780
known instead of just telling you about

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,310
it so you don't have to ask again

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,530
completely ignoring contributions and

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,480
open source stuff so if somebody you

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,620
know takes the time to want to

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,660
contribute to something that you're a

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,920
part of and you just ignore them it's

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,540
not going to make them want to

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,989
participate in the future which isn't a

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,549
way to grow communities alternately for

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,370
maintainer is a demanding user base

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:16,590
which if you notice I've talked to a

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,500
couple people about this as soon as

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:24,780
somebody open sources a new project

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,970
usually the the first like slow of open

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,840
pull requests or issues will be people

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,070
complaining about spelling grammar they

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,590
don't like the way that certain things

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,440
are done and just like complaining in

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,520
general in

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,240
of being happy that there's something

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,770
new for them to try and also useless

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,700
pull requests for the sake of a green

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,830
timeline you don't need to be that

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,110
person that makes the first pull request

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,690
fixing a couple commas and periods just

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,150
for the sake of like commenting first on

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,100
a post it's like your github timeline is

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,570
not an indicator of your self-worth and

00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:05,290
I really wish that more people would

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:08,080
realize that also insulting the

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,780
contributor uh I don't even know why

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,030
this I have to say this it makes no

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,740
sense you shouldn't insult people that

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,800
are trying to be productive just don't

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,140
do it or disagreeing over trivial things

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,840
by trivial things I guess it's not

00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,550
really trivial but there's been a lot of

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,680
stuff lately with people complaining

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,750
about wanting to change terminology and

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,090
get rid of the master-slave terminology

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,160
which is completely warranted and you

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,450
shouldn't argue over it if it's still

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,680
going to function the same way but not

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,360
make people uncomfortable so when I was

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,120
like starting on this project and

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,720
wanting to get involved in open source

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,180
and see how other people that I interact

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,030
with which are mostly women in tech I

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,210
polled on Twitter to see what kind of

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,720
experiences people have and I'm just

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:02,169
going to read them to Jen shipper said

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,300
vulgar and brutal harassment expectation

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:08,910
and entitlement of your time without any

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:11,260
compensation offered the next one is

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,120
unfortunately the harassment was enough

00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,300
for me to stop trying before I had other

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,680
problems so that's where I met so they

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,360
didn't even get to the point where they

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,600
were contributing because of the

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,760
harassment in general this next one's

00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,380
anonymous because they didn't even want

00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,590
to be attached for fear of further

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,419
harassment entitlement of time the

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,330
assumption you immediately want feedback

00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:38,740
when you're just starting nerd pedantic

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:41,340
and obstructing learning a co-worker of

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,960
mine and friend Caroline said

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,120
mansplaining mainly in a general fear

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,950
that any commit I make will be open as

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,680
an issue

00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:54,140
debated about Caroline's involved a lot

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,970
with like security stuff and she has a

00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,790
legit reason for being afraid because

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,950
she has gotten doxxed and your family

00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:05,730
has gotten swatted it's like not cool

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:08,220
that these things happen and the next

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,230
one is sent a pull request with bug

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,450
fixes that got ignored for almost a year

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:18,330
after which the maintainer wrote the

00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:21,390
same fixes and said oops next is Tess

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:24,270
who also said mansplaining my own code

00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,520
to me and trolling Tess is pretty

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:29,670
relevant because she open source

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,920
something a little bit last year called

00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,410
echo chamber j/s which is all of the

00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,910
commenting none of the comments what it

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,220
is is it's a third-party script that you

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,350
add to your website that utilizes local

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,480
storage with your comments form so all

00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:45,690
the people that want to say garbage will

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,370
post hit that send button it'll store

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,900
locally on their machine and look at the

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,270
feel proud of themselves for being an

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,300
 that nobody else ever has to see

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:57,500
it which is really awesome and uh when

00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,270
she made this which is clearly like not

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,290
serious more of like social commentary

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:06,750
on internet comments she got trolled

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:09,350
this this awesome kind gentleman with

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:13,110
the Steve Jobs I calm it says I dead

00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:15,630
opened a pull request or an issue that

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,250
says you're fat and then they were like

00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,080
that's not enough so they changed it

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:23,370
from your fat to your fat and insecure

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,740
and then another one from ghost too I

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:29,370
believe is one of those people that only

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,260
complains on repositories and maybe like

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,580
commits to some things I'm going to read

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,770
this whole thing because it's really sad

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,330
I'll read it maybe I'll be quick web

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,280
development or web design does have a

00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,170
psychological part besides the technical

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,760
part and this library is intended to

00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:44,490
give the illusion to the user that he

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,800
and gate he engages with the website by

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,080
commenting it it clearly has the intent

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,790
or to do poor trick the end user as no

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,170
indication is given that his or her

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,500
message will not be sent through the

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,420
network I'm I'll skip the next one and

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,400
it says such library seems to rise

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,780
epical concerns about the relationship

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,090
between the maintainer of the

00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,860
site and the end user it is promoting

00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,930
relationships based on duping another

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,780
that is a form of irresponsibility and

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,400
indifference is it any good just asking

00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,680
to myself and I'm going to go ahead and

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,450
answer him and say no nobody was you

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,610
 and you shouldn't feel entitled to

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:22,890
even say this stuff so when coming for a

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,600
new project my proposal for new

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,820
contributors which is something that I

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,550
did myself is find something you're

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,600
passionate about for me it's cats in a

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:35,280
totally healthy way I swear or something

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,300
new that you want to try it for me it

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,980
was hardware and some back-end stuff

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,260
make something cool and open source at

00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,660
yourself which is this grade school

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,960
science project with popsicle sticks and

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,940
tape and wires because when you do that

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,770
the first point of contact for use your

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,970
peers and people that respect you as a

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,790
human being you're going to give you

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,860
constructive constructive criticism

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:04,530
which is a billion times more helpful

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:08,450
than randos being jerks so these are my

00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:12,000
cats their names are Rick Deckard and

00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:16,920
reset smith rick is fat and reset is

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,540
very handsome I like cats a lot I've

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,460
been talking about building a cat feeder

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,020
bought forever to the point that I think

00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,660
I just annoyed some of my friends and

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:28,650
they were like just do you have to do it

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:32,100
so you shut up about it from past j/s

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:33,660
comps in Florida I had loved my brief

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,020
experience with the node box community

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,480
it's so friendly and really helpful the

00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,950
documentation is amazing and all the

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,470
people are really great and plus there's

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,420
slack channels there's get er channels

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,890
people even answer you on Twitter even

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,820
when you sometimes don't want them to

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,770
it's like excessively helpful so I

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,840
decided to build a node-based cat feeder

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:59,610
that works over the web and that's this

00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:01,209
thing and it is robo kitty here's my

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,670
cats again

00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:08,410
that's reset I said he was handsome and

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:12,850
that's fabric so the tech that I picked

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:16,410
for this project was no jeaious Johnny 5

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:19,749
which is a JavaScript robotics library

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,699
socket i/o and then when I was trying to

00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:24,339
decide what microcontrollers to use I I

00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:26,019
struggled a little bit first I I wanted

00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:28,360
the Arduino Uno because it already has

00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:31,360
that Internet connectivity no it does

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,339
not and that's why it didn't work so I

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,019
grabbed the Arduino you which does have

00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:37,149
the Internet connectivity but it wasn't

00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,309
compatible with Johnny 5 and then I

00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:41,350
finally settled on particle photon so I

00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:45,819
spent a lot of money so you don't have

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:49,059
to UM the part list for this is a

00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:50,889
typical dry goods dispenser which I got

00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:53,800
on amazon it's the kind that they put

00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:56,399
cereal in at hotels for continental

00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,839
breakfast it's about twenty dollars a

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,269
particle photon kit with a breadboard

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,360
which also runs like twenty thirty

00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:08,589
dollars a continuous servo which is

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,660
taped on to the front and a four double

00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:12,850
a battery pack with on/off switch which

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,990
I would not recommend instead figure out

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,350
how to plug it in because that thing

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,970
eats batteries like crazy and a

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,649
miscellaneous harp and miscellaneous

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,439
hardware accessories that I use our male

00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:27,339
to male jumper wires which are for

00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:30,129
connecting the breadboard to the servo

00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:33,040
and I had to solder a little bit and

00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:34,509
some heat-shrink so never having worked

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,850
with any of this stuff before i bought

00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:38,589
it all and I'm at home I kind of have an

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,799
idea in my head of like how it's going

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:44,410
to work from point A to point B and then

00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,059
I'm like this otter trying to like put

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,649
all the pieces together and I was like I

00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:52,209
really i don't i don't know what I'm

00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:54,819
doing I mean in short like things pretty

00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:57,819
pretty much one smoothly except that

00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:59,679
electricity scares me I don't understand

00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,240
Ohm's law at all so I thought that I was

00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,069
going to constantly electrocute myself

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,990
which wouldn't really be possible even

00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:07,839
with the amount of power coming through

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,850
there now that I know I also didn't

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,830
realize that I needed to externally

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:15,560
power the servo I was like all right

00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:18,140
this microcontroller has power so if i

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,740
plug this into the microcontroller then

00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:24,590
it should work right no it doesn't i

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,020
also had no idea how to solder when i

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,450
began now I know how to solder I'm

00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,610
really good at it but um so what I did

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,680
is I went on YouTube and I googled how

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,690
to solder as you do when you don't know

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,290
how to do something and the video

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,610
results that I got was a very helpful

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,760
doomsday prepper he was wearing full

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:47,180
camouflage he had I don't know probably

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,220
like ready to eat MRE food rations and

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,930
he was just like take this wire you take

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,640
this wire and he didn't even like try

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,770
and preach about any other things it was

00:13:52,640 --> 00:14:01,580
really great so then I was ready to test

00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:03,950
the code was working awesome i'm using

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,600
cronjob currently because i wanted to

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,320
not only have it dispensed food

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,610
immediately i also wanted it to be timed

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,320
there's better ways to do it you can

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,230
open a pull request if you want to fix

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,640
it for me and the server was strong

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,170
enough to turn the feeder handle which i

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,420
was a little bit worried about if you

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,330
have it totally full is food gonna come

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,400
out so everything's working great except

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,900
it wouldn't stop at all if you push the

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,520
button like everything that was in there

00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,500
would just keep on coming out on all

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,660
over the floor and like fatrick loves

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,350
that but that's like the opposite of

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,850
what I wanted to happen so I do what I

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,320
always do when that something doesn't

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,060
work which if you follow me on Twitter

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,670
I'm sure you saw this morning because I

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:48,080
couldn't get it to work I started

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:51,680
freaking out I just like yell and I'm

00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,570
like why what's happening I'm sad it's

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,060
probably Rick Waldron's fault cuz it's

00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:59,780
fun to blame things on him it wasn't

00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,670
this time it was that time though but I

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,350
looked my peers for help like I

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,260
mentioned before the get er chat was

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,390
amazing Brooklyn jas which is where i'm

00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,810
from made a no BOTS room so i would stop

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,880
bothering them in dms people reviewed my

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,230
code actually soos who's talking

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,930
tomorrow reviewed my code and she was

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,930
like nothing's wrong it looks great and

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:23,120
then I was like well what's happening

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,980
but then something awesome happened it

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,249
was a bug in Johnny 5 and it was Rick

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:30,230
Waldron's fault

00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:32,569
so I I tweeted the code from my

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,910
automated feeder is done if I didn't

00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:38,989
already have a cat named Rick I'd name

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:42,319
the one after Rick Waldron and he he

00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:45,230
found the bug he fixed it and then it

00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:46,669
worked and that felt so good because if

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,999
somebody else wants to build it and it

00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:52,549
didn't work that would be a huge problem

00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:54,199
now I'm going to show you a little bit

00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:57,559
of the server code as it was when I

00:15:54,199 --> 00:16:00,169
first wrote it um this was my first time

00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:03,019
trying any of this stuff so I kind of

00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:05,869
just like dumped it into a huge file and

00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:08,149
this was done in November and it since

00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:10,609
evolved into way more elaborate stuff

00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:14,389
but i'll show you this a little bit i

00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:16,910
have like a regular node app running I

00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:18,499
didn't have any routing at the time you

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,689
just set up your little server thing

00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:23,119
sorry wordwrap is on but i'm not going

00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:26,689
to scroll over this is how you set up

00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:29,410
your board with Johnny Five and then the

00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:33,379
cron job is really ugly but there it is

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:35,809
and then once it's on and connected what

00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:38,839
it's doing is it tells the servo to stop

00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:40,579
in case it's on already which I don't

00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,549
know why it would be it's just like just

00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:45,169
in case you're on stop and then it turns

00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:46,789
on a little bit and goes backwards in

00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:49,850
case there's a jam and then turns

00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:51,949
forward again and is like yeah there's

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,809
food and it's set to New York so

00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:55,339
obviously if you're not in New York and

00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:56,779
you want to feed your cats on our normal

00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:59,539
schedule you'd have to change that and

00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:01,399
then so that's the server code and then

00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:06,230
the client code before routing was added

00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:07,939
in was just a plain website and it sets

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,010
it to every few hours and then clear

00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:13,309
schedule and then there's some inline

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,110
script at the bottom and the site's

00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:16,490
really cute because it's on theme and it

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:19,970
looks like this which I'll show you a

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:22,650
little bit later so once it works the

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:26,030
cats were like yeah

00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:29,160
this is not a picture of rec I promise

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:31,530
so I was almost ready to open source it

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,080
I was getting really close things were

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,820
working out great and I put a call out

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,710
on Twitter for code reviews because I

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,590
wanted you know people that I trust to

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,660
check it before people tear it apart and

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,450
the response was pretty pretty

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,640
overwhelming so many people helped me

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,520
out the contributions went from like

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,350
just me like sad at my coffee table

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,930
because my apartments not big enough for

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:58,710
a dining room table to like a ton of

00:17:54,930 --> 00:18:01,620
contributions they added in a routing

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,410
ave refactor did there's like an NPM

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:07,220
module I don't even know if it's done um

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:10,920
but yeah they had they helped a lot and

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,420
then I was I just told you all this and

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,250
they review the readme for language

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,320
that's like the biggest part of this

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,200
project since I didn't know what I was

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,620
doing when I started I wanted to write

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,330
the readme as if someone that had no

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:28,320
idea what they were doing technically

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:30,540
could go in and get the code and do

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,280
everything step by step so I made no

00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,990
assumptions it's really long and

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,300
honestly writing language that was

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,890
accessible to anyone without like

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,990
guessing what their technical background

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,740
was was probably harder for me than this

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,030
whole entire project but I wanted

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,500
somebody if they were interested in it

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,150
to have the same experience that I had

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,580
when I was interested in no bots and be

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,320
able to just like pick things and then

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,890
go find out how to do it and be able to

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,510
set it all up and after they did all

00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,250
this for me like the most exciting thing

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:02,400
for me was that they actually liked it

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:05,310
so I was really happy and then I got to

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,740
test it with the cats um it worked it

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:10,230
used to be cardboard but cardboard

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,110
doesn't travel really well and popsicle

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:17,700
sticks does better Rick was my tester

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:21,270
and we got this really cute animation of

00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,750
him being like yeah it's time to eat so

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:27,090
it worked really well I was ready to

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,110
launch finally and what I did is I

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:33,990
changed the repository to public I

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:36,029
tweeted about it for some reason I

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:39,659
submitted a link to hacker news

00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:41,759
and then I took a nap uh and and when I

00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:43,469
woke up from my nap it was on the front

00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,809
page of hacker news and people weren't

00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:47,999
being jerks which is surprising it was

00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,950
off brand but i was happy although

00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:51,749
someone was like you could have done

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,529
this and I was like whatever you do it

00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:57,719
I'll have two people retweeted it a lot

00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:01,049
it's like way more than this now and

00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:02,190
there's been some forks and requests for

00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,379
it to be on different microcontrollers

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,909
which I'm going to do after this because

00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:09,239
I spent three hours this morning trying

00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:11,609
to get it to work and it was start a ton

00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:14,070
it's actually over 700 now which you

00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:15,629
know not a matter of your self-worth but

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,489
it was my first open source project so

00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:19,649
it felt really great but the most the

00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:23,129
best most exciting part was that I was

00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:25,830
huge in Japan and this is like this is

00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:27,749
like from what I can gather the the like

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,570
Japanese equivalent of TechCrunch I

00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:32,339
guess um there's something lost in

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,799
translation they assumed that I had

00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:36,210
never done any programming whatsoever so

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,499
that's probably why they wrote about it

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,519
they thought it was a lot cooler than it

00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:42,659
actually was or cats who knows so the

00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,729
things that I learned from this whole

00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:47,279
project was um don't be afraid of the

00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:49,139
unfamiliar because what you don't know

00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,519
at the beginning you will know at the

00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:53,119
end and then you'll be able to tell

00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,859
other people about it and everybody wins

00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,649
also uh don't be afraid to ask for help

00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:01,499
this is something that I had struggled

00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:04,080
with for a while due to like bad

00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:06,330
experiences in tech but people that are

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,669
like willing to help you are are great

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,379
and then once they help you you can help

00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:14,279
other people and it's just an endless

00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:20,700
nice cycle of helping people really like

00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:23,070
cats unless you don't and then why don't

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,499
downplay your abilities when I started

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:29,219
talking about this project I was like I

00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:31,529
mean it's just a microcontroller turning

00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:33,269
his servo but I probably should have

00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:35,339
been like it's a really awesome cat

00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:37,349
feeder and like the only person that was

00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:38,759
probably like not the only person the

00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:40,289
person thought it was the coolest was my

00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:41,820
mom and she was like you should hire a

00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,919
lawyer and get a patent I was like mom

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,779
that's not what open sourcing is like

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,170
and I don't care and if you saw this

00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:51,630
thing you would not agree

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:54,090
also I really really really like node

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,500
BOTS there's so much fun there's so many

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,650
things that you can do with it I mean

00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,690
you can pretty much pick there's a ton

00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,850
of different microcontrollers and then

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,580
you're just like I want to connect a

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,710
light or a switch or a button or a

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,810
potentiometer or an accelerometer and

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,520
they'll tell you exactly how to do it

00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:17,520
and then you can do silly things like

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:22,680
this and now is the moment of truth all

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:29,910
right let's see if this demo works give

00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:39,060
me one second I'm gonna close this no

00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:41,490
doubt yes it is connected localhost this

00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,980
is Bravo kitty isn't it cute I'm gonna

00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,630
turn the battery on and there is candy

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,500
in here so if you like candy on the

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,500
floor it's your lucky day

00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:02,239
I'm gonna let it all right now all right

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:04,850
and then they have one more thing to

00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:10,970
show you not on the feeder and it's

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:14,479
basically just the end of my talk so

00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:16,669
yeah thank you I'm oh ho on twitter if

00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:20,210
you want to contribute to the repository

00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:23,629
at all it's rachel nicole / robo kitty

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:25,940
and my website is rachel is awesome with

00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:27,649
a dot Emmy and I'm cool online for all

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,779
the weird stuff that I like to make and

00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:31,249
please feel free to eat this candy it's

00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:32,979
been down there for longer than five

00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:35,979
seconds but it's probably still good

00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:35,979
