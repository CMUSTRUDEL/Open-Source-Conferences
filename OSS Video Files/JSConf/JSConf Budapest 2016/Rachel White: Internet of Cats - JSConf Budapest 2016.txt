Publication date: 2016-06-13
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2016
Description: 
	Ever lose out on a good night's rest because your pesky cats keep waking you up at 4am for food? Rachel has. Many times. For her first project using node, socket.io, microcontrollers, and johnny-five, Rachel built a web-based feeder that delivers tasty cat chow on a configurable schedule or when triggered remotely. She'll walk you through her learning process and get you excited about trying new things in your own projects. Finally, she'll show you how to take the first steps to release your work to the open source community.
