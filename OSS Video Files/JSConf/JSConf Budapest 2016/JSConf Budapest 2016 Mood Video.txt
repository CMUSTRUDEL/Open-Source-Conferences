I

00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:41,100
things that I like about my profession

00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:42,659
about development specifically is that

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,970
it's kind of constantly evolving and

00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,829
it's moving route fairly fast I think

00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,440
compared to other things I love my job

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,170
because I can do everything I have in my

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,729
hat and create stuff that other people

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,219
can see because you only need the

00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:57,690
problem I like JavaScript so anything

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,180
that has to do with JavaScript

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,429
immediately excites me there's no right

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,110
way to do things I think a note in

00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,030
particular people keep inventing new

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,590
ways of doing stuff and everybody goes

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,759
oh we could be doing it that way or we

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,649
could be doing it this way and nobody's

00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:12,149
really sure like what's the best way and

00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:14,250
that's my favorite thing about it is

00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:16,770
it's still constantly changing I really

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,740
love developing software and helping

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,600
others I'm also instructor and I love

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,700
combining the two where I've depends on

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,399
experience and it can go to people and

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,140
explain stuff that really works at the

00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:30,929
community I mean as I talked about in my

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,940
talk was I love the community is why I

00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:34,619
stick with the web and wife stuff with

00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,509
continuing to push it forward because I

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,890
think it's really inclusive and really

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,479
easy and approachable to get started

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,160
with and in case you to bring in more

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,950
people from different disciplines I love

00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,080
the ability to write something on my

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,700
laptop and publish it to the world and

00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,530
have an impact on people and help their

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,509
feedback as a researcher I get a lot of

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,650
flexibility I get to play with new

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,350
things and

00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,420
more ideas I love being able to work on

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,820
something with other people that in the

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,530
end has impact and being able to help

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,840
people with what we do with technology

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,010
is really thing that I enjoy most about

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,010
being insulted
