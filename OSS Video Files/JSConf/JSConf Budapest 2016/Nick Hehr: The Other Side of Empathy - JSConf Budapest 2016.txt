Title: Nick Hehr: The Other Side of Empathy - JSConf Budapest 2016
Publication date: 2016-06-13
Playlist: JSConf Budapest 2016
Description: 
	In an industry that is so focused frameworks & tooling, we tend to lose sight of the people behind the products and how we work with them. Iâ€™ve found empathy to be a powerful resource while collaborating with teams inside companies and across the open source community. By breaking down The Other Side of Empathy, I will demonstrate how applying its principles to your development process will benefit the community and the products they create.

you don't wanna step on all the candy

00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:16,730
that's a lot there hi so my talk is

00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,080
called the other side of empathy and

00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,779
I'll get into what that exactly means

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,480
pretty soon but a kind of apt

00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:27,949
description is kind of an intro into

00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:34,240
encouraging exemplifying empathy so

00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:39,530
again hello so who am i why am i up here

00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:42,710
how did I get here so i am nick her hair

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,840
if you're from Germany I am first and

00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:48,020
foremost an empathetic community member

00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,910
I am a maintainer of the one of the

00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,470
hoodie projects one of the many

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:56,450
different modules that they have and

00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:59,990
they put out I am recently a tehsil to

00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:02,810
hustle project team member and I am also

00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:05,509
an organizer of a meetup in New York

00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,070
called Manhattan jas so one of the many

00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:08,000
barojah so yeah we had a couple of

00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,030
people here tonight who have spoken

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,670
there too and then you can find me

00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,020
online at a hipster brown so look for

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,299
charlie brown with a mustache and that's

00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,469
me and if you may have noticed now I

00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:23,840
have a pretty wicked mustache but

00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:25,999
important thing to note as it's not to

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,939
be touched it may sound like a weird

00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:32,840
request but it's happened before so just

00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:34,130
going to put it out there so yeah why am

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,299
I here talking about empathy why do I

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:40,130
care so much about it I could say it's

00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,590
because I study psychology and

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,109
leadership in college and not really CS

00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,829
but really learn more about how people

00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:51,049
work together it could be because I as a

00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:52,520
front-end developer I'm causative

00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:54,709
collaborating with different types of

00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:59,060
people different backgrounds Putte

00:01:54,709 --> 00:02:01,429
designers or developers but for the most

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,700
part it's just because I love community

00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:06,740
and the JavaScript community and the web

00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,569
development community and node BOTS and

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,310
all these type of things it's the

00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:13,370
community that led me into exploring

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,349
those options it's the people there that

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,849
keep me there and make me want to work

00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:19,400
more and maybe going to work on open

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:24,829
source and contribute back

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:27,530
and I just really love it and now who

00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:30,620
else should care it's a pretty easy

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:35,180
question everybody I know crazy right

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:37,069
it's really wild but it's something that

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,859
we should all care about because it

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,329
impacts all of us you all are here today

00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,670
because you care about something you

00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:45,799
care about learning you care about

00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,400
talking and meeting with other people in

00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:53,560
the community or you care about candy or

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,180
shirts that you get at the at the front

00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,560
so it's called the other side of empathy

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,150
but what is empathy we may have heard it

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,040
as like seeing the world through the

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,040
eyes of someone else taking the walk in

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,930
someone else's shoes and it's very

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,389
general it doesn't give a lot of apt

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:15,049
description but I like to think of it as

00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:17,659
the ability to understand and share the

00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:19,579
feelings of another that's not

00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,170
necessarily all feelings and emotion but

00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:24,109
feeling it able to understand and

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:28,010
connect with them is really true empathy

00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:33,590
as I see it so where did the other side

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:36,220
of empathy come from so as anyone who

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,019
uses Twitter there tends to be some

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,069
negative thoughts that come out

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:42,290
something comes something new comes out

00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,060
like maybe the Instagram icon that got

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,650
released yesterday and there are many

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,540
snap judgments that people come up with

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,739
their people who instantly have

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,419
something and they take to Twitter and

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:54,919
it's like 140 characters firing off 10

00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:58,220
10 11 and then this mob mentality forms

00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,629
around it and it's just a layer of

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,510
negativity that's hard to get through

00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:04,849
and it must say just really bums me out

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,109
and it's hard to see some of the

00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:08,299
positive sides of the internet when

00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:10,400
stuff like that happens and I wanted to

00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:12,769
be able to see and connect with those

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,720
people and be like but if you knew the

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,970
person who worked on that would you say

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,789
to their face which you able to connect

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,139
with them that way and if you knew could

00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:22,760
empathize with them would you say the

00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:26,479
same thing and we've heard from Rachel

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,789
about how she was so fearful of

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,320
contributing and becoming part of the

00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:31,820
open source community because of those

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,020
negative things that happen it's not

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,120
just Twitter

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,370
and in a lot of open communities so how

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,470
can resolve that how can we add empathy

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,690
and encourage it from our perspective

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,490
and get and receive it as well so the

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,879
other side is encouraging it as well as

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:50,389
be able to receive it back so it breaks

00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:53,720
down into kind of four tenants I like to

00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,900
say one of them is context constructive

00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,460
feedback as rachel has mentioned before

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,740
communication is very important and last

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,990
of all caring and these are kind of what

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,190
I'll be going through in-depth and

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:10,780
describing kind of how these apply to my

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,460
everyday job and as well as how I

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,389
impacted by the open source community

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,849
and things I've learned from it as well

00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,860
so I gave you all that but that

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:23,630
background knowledge that's basically a

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:25,969
context so another description that

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,949
internal external factors that influence

00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:31,310
the decisions we make any actions we

00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:33,830
take internally could be subconscious it

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,780
could be something or could be external

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,289
factors by the way people we've learned

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:43,759
from others so it relates into this

00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:46,759
other side theory in that no one is

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,110
unoffending dated we have something that

00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,340
we we have some kind of bias that we

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,409
have we may not recognize it right away

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,669
but it's there we've heard of onion

00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:55,279
pending native frameworks but the fact

00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:57,319
that it's not a framework but a library

00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,400
or a bunch of modules is an opinion

00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,659
about how they want to structure their

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,389
project we all have biases like I said

00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:07,819
it may recognize it or not an important

00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:09,469
part of contexts listening if someone's

00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:10,880
trying to give you some from information

00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,819
and you're not listening or we're not

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,830
listening back then it just kind of

00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:19,719
negates the whole part of empathizing

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:23,479
with them and of course asking why and

00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:25,849
asking why in a good way in an

00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:27,650
intentional way and wanting to learn

00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:30,169
from it and just continue asking why

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,509
until we find out and can connect with

00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:34,550
them and not why in a condescending way

00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:38,659
like rachel has heard from before and

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,819
kind of feigning ignorance and we can do

00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:42,589
this a bit more and set the example

00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:45,110
around giving context and receiving it's

00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:46,670
a great way that I've done it at work

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,740
and in have been courage to do it

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,260
or in open source projects is code

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,620
comments coke comments are really easy

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:57,080
way for people to read through a snippet

00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,680
of code and understand what the author

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,410
was thinking about during that time it's

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,940
the ability for someone to jump into the

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,920
authors Bryan say what the heck were

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,830
they thinking or that teklet was I

00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,730
thinking while writing this bit of code

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:15,200
and as especially in hardware I've

00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,600
become more aware of how important this

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,620
is so this is something actually

00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,920
straight out of the tehsil CLI it's

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,590
dealing with node chip which is binary

00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,230
modules doesn't really matter but seeing

00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,510
that but python is inside this no script

00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,120
might help clear up why the heck this is

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,610
here it without all this kind of story

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,770
and train of thought that we could

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,670
follow along with we wouldn't really be

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,830
able to follow that if we had to

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,940
continue with it later or if someone

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,310
else is trying to jump to the project

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,870
contribute and salt just a bunch of

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,620
nonsense they're like why is this here

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:55,520
I'll just remove it and then we can just

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:59,060
remember what's going on again and so

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,940
remembering contexts for me comes in

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,050
kind of four steps I generally take a

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:08,060
deep breath and then I try to push aside

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,270
some snap judgments that come up I'm

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,290
very clear on recognizing what comes up

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,120
acknowledging those biases and trying to

00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,260
see where they come from but making sure

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,490
that's not the first thing that comes

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:22,550
out of my mouth sincerely asking why why

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:26,510
did they choose to do this thing where

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:29,270
did this context come from and then

00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,670
listening really really listening and

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,990
trying to pull in and parse what they're

00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,729
saying and then asking why if you don't

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:38,720
understand again don't make assumptions

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:42,650
and sincerely try to connect with them

00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,540
and once we get that context and once we

00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:48,910
give our context as well we might start

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:51,950
asking for constructive feedback and

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:55,550
understanding and getting to get

00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:57,650
responded with embeth empathy so

00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,510
constructive feedback very simply put is

00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,100
the return of information that helps to

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,279
do

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:07,240
or improve anything it can be a blog

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:10,019
post code design and it's that

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,579
constructive part of it that is key

00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,350
there's negative feedback startup

00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:17,319
criticism isn't great either and we just

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:21,699
want or even positive feedback and I'll

00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:24,009
go into that as well so we may have

00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:26,079
heard when we were younger at least when

00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,490
I went to school it was a lot of if you

00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:30,220
don't have anything nice to say then

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,860
don't say it at all kind of the golden

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,759
rule or do unto you what you would have

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:38,410
done or something like that and

00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,360
somewhere between great school or

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,060
primary school were taught that we tend

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,130
to kind of lose it we don't remember

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,839
where it came from or even as we come

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,660
adults why we should keep remembering

00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,000
this and for this talk I specifically

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:56,199
want to talk about this constructive

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,089
part of it so when giving feedback just

00:09:56,199 --> 00:10:00,130
saying that looks great that's that's

00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:01,360
that rocks is and we're at when we're

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,279
genuinely asking for constructive

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,589
feedback that doesn't really help yes

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,970
and so we're going to want to ask for

00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:08,800
another thing to constructive to say

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,560
don't say anything at all we may have

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,380
seen like github comments the +1 it's

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,630
great to get that feedback but it's just

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,490
going to annoy cause noise for that fee

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,410
that issue we want to get genuine

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,670
constructive feedback and help people

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:27,639
using it or make it help it improve

00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,720
later on and then some people kind of

00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:33,430
have brought up before what about

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,110
negative feedback and as I've talked to

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,949
some people on Twitter before again back

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:42,310
with Twitter a negative feedback can

00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:45,399
might make change but good feedback

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,139
takes more than 140 characters as Rachel

00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,360
maver reference before getting feedback

00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:52,089
and trying to get help on Twitter it's

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,250
really hard you lose context people jump

00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:55,959
in to random bits of the conversation

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,490
not seeing what was happening before and

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:02,350
not just getting enough information to

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,730
give a really helpful comments yeah the

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,139
whole hundred forty characters problem

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,329
maybe we shouldn't use Twitter for that

00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:10,209
type of stuff sometimes it could be

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:13,690
better ways and so constructive feedback

00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:16,480
is mutual mutually agreed upon like

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,340
for like Rachel reference before is like

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,950
random people coming in for someone's

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,660
first contribution when it's generally

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,000
not asked for yet if they release it and

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,230
people jump in without being knowledge

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,330
that they're being asked for

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,220
constructive feedback it becomes off as

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:33,430
defensive for the people receiving it

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,110
and it set up with expectations okay i'm

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,560
getting code review I which I'll

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,000
reference soon and the expectation is

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,920
that I want you to focus on this part of

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,080
the code not this part I recognize that

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,280
it's not great but it's going to be

00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,880
distracting if we start focusing on it

00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,050
now it's in an open space and by open

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,690
space I don't necessarily mean like a

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,820
big room I mean in a way that people can

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,280
pull back from that feedback if it's too

00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:00,940
much for them if it's anxiety driven if

00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:03,610
it becomes just too stressful that they

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,140
can pull away whenever they want to it's

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,970
not someone coming up to their chair and

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,410
in saying have some thoughts about this

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,080
and they're just like I can't do this

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,450
right now there's none and it's also

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,160
shared with context we need context

00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,610
behind why they think this is good

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,980
feedback so yeah code brews are a really

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,830
easy example at work and in an open

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,050
source and there tend to defined in fix

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,130
mistakes that are overlooked proving and

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,230
overall quality of software and

00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,050
developer skills overall quality can be

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,400
kind of subjective but the fact that

00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,720
they wouldn't improve it is the big

00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,950
thing it's not commenting on spelling

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,980
mistakes if that's not what's being

00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:41,230
focused on for a constructive feedback

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,940
and we can encourage it to especially

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,500
with an open source there's some great

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,100
little things that github is provided

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,620
and other platforms as well contributing

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,970
md files whenever some ties to open up

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,890
or request or create an issue we have

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,810
these guidelines for you to view and not

00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,780
everyone may click on that but they're

00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:01,330
available for people to view so my

00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,940
favorites are the atom projects has some

00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:06,130
great guidelines and with emoji and

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,900
great descriptions as well as the hoodie

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,510
project I'm a little biased but it's

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,890
really really perfect they go into all

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,600
sorts of things about how the project is

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,690
managed and how they can help out in any

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,750
way with writing issues and even code

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,610
and then recently issue templates

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,350
started popping up for github

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,210
repositories as well as get lab has had

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,640
them for a while and it's great for

00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:30,130
setting up okay I need this

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,420
back from you I need this context in

00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:35,800
order to really help out and so you can

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,360
give me proper feedback on something

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,530
that's bugging you or something that you

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,790
want to help fix and all of this type of

00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:46,600
context and constructive feedback comes

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,370
through proper communication basically

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,840
the successful sharing of ideas and

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,160
feelings between people and ultimately

00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,990
communication is how we interact with

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,540
each other we communicate by talking in

00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,770
the hallways communicate online there

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,960
are so many people who I've communicated

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,180
solely online and then just got to meet

00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,460
at conferences and having that solid

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,450
communication beforehand helped me feel

00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:13,990
more comfortable meeting them in person

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:18,670
so it relates in what we sing how we say

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:22,750
it and where we say it as well in how we

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,480
say things I statements are very very

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:28,480
nice for giving constructive feedback

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,810
saying I saw this thing that will help

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,320
improve this code I believe it's not

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:39,100
good for getting context saying that i

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,130
know this is better just because it's

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,350
not great for that use statements are

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,120
great for getting context why did you

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,900
make this decision why did you choose

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:53,470
this library why did you choose to have

00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,060
this arbitrary number of timeouts but

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:59,290
it's not great for giving constructive

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:05,170
feedback you should fix this you have

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:06,730
done this wrong that's not great and for

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,900
communication we have different so many

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,300
different mediums communicate through

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,740
now at work we communicate through so

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,750
many different options and they all have

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,020
their own purpose slack is a great

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,520
general super quick chats especially for

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,650
remote employees or even people around

00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,310
the office for just quick feedback with

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:27,910
a group stand-ups are great for giving

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,980
more in person one to one context and

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,940
then recorded scuss ins that comes with

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,940
github issues that can be referenced

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,860
later and enforce long form or a sync

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,690
email is the perfect option we don't

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,690
always need an answer right away email

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,320
is great to give people time and

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,230
measured

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,550
back and discussions mailing list might

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:49,270
be another thing but we'll go into that

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:51,790
the note option and we can create

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:56,410
communication I have one point here I

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:59,760
want to touch on the word sucks is kind

00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:02,980
of a trigger word for me because it

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,560
provides no context it provides no

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,810
constructive feedback and just kind of

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,270
it's dead in the water as far as

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,830
continuing and creating empathy whenever

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:15,310
here someone says something sucks on

00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,810
Twitter or in just general comments it

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,660
doesn't help me it doesn't help the

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:22,170
person who's getting feedback and unless

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,610
you're talking about like DJ Roomba

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:29,170
sucks or some kind of other vacuum sucks

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:31,630
has really no beneficial and sometimes

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,930
yes something sucks but we can be more

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,490
descriptive to help out other people

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,810
that said before there are many other

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:42,430
mediums to chat with people especially

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:44,230
online and giving more wide more

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,650
characters than 140 to chat with other

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:49,510
people their slack getter IRC that still

00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,490
exists I know slacks very popular I RC

00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:56,080
still exist as well and of course github

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:59,770
and slack I really like because of the

00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,390
customization options so in the hoodie

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:04,930
slack and some other slacks I've added

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:07,089
this little line in the slack bot to say

00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,680
when someone said something sucks could

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,060
you be more descriptive I don't

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,880
understand could you empathize on that

00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:15,100
or just different options to try to pull

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,780
more information from them so that I can

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,370
understand and others can understand

00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,209
what they're going through and how we

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:26,230
can help fix it and ultimately all these

00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:28,570
options they require caring it's

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,730
providing the need of something and

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:35,830
showing interest in it genuine interest

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:38,650
in it it's caring is sharing it's

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,910
listening and ultimately as I said in

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,210
the beginning it's understanding and

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:45,730
connecting with people and we can show

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,650
how much we care as contributors and

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,080
maintain errs and even people trying to

00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:54,390
use and as part of the community around

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,190
a project or a library or a person

00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,380
you care enough to write a blog post to

00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,790
kind of go through your steps that gives

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,370
so much context if we can read a

00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,870
long-form answer of that you can't have

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,280
to file an issue if you have a getup

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,740
account and you're able to file an issue

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,020
or even sending email as an issue to

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,570
someone do you have that time can you

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,640
you send the email do you have enough

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,890
time to record a screencast that really

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,900
helps give a lot of contacts with kind

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,480
of arbitrary details that someone might

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,100
not add through text I mean pictures

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,010
worth a thousand words a screencast will

00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,980
give you a million and you even have

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,690
enough time and availability and care to

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,130
submit a pull request I know not

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,260
everyone has the technical knowledge or

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,780
even the time or even the privilege to

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,150
go and contribute to that but if you

00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,860
have the time and the ability and

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,650
someone else is working on something

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,110
else overall or just does not have the

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,670
bandwidth to do that can you can you

00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,090
actually start helping at least and then

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:53,190
they can help finish you along the way

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:56,130
and of course don't give in to hate it

00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:59,820
leads to the dark side we shouldn't hate

00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,410
on things in the sense that we care so

00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,670
much about it that we hate that it's not

00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:09,050
getting done it's more about what can we

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:11,970
do to help in any way possible

00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,810
documentation is super important as

00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,060
we've been learning more and more

00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:18,510
throughout working on open source and

00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:21,810
even internally in companies wikis code

00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:24,030
comments style guides pattern libraries

00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,550
even a readme a simple reading can go so

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,860
far to helping encourage contributions

00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:33,390
or empathy empathizing with the creator

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:36,900
of a project and we can exemplify

00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:38,100
carrying in so many different ways I'm

00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,630
going to embarrass her right now but

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,750
it's one of my favorite things that's

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:46,710
kind of recently has been Susan's AVR

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:48,390
girl test pilot it's an example of going

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,690
above and beyond caring about

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:53,460
contributors and a community for project

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:57,600
it's an app that she bundled with the

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,810
CLI for AVR girl Arduino and it helps

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,680
people want to contribute to

00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,210
automatically run through her hardware

00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,310
test suite with whatever board they have

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,800
on them fast with Arduino and there's so

00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:10,400
many out there that this

00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,510
her not buy everything and helps her

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,790
contribute logs about maybe something

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,790
went wrong and in their environment that

00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:22,020
she can get a lot of context from that

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:24,240
and because they're opting into sharing

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,100
what they want they have the option to

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,260
be added as a contributor to the project

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,790
which is just great it helps that green

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,080
graph even though it doesn't mean that

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,850
much and shouldn't care too much about

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,710
it some people do and they want to see

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,140
that on their timeline and see that oh I

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,060
helped out this project so Sue's has

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,650
made that a great part of encouraging

00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:46,800
and caring more about the project and

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:48,120
this is great reasons why to create

00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,060
something like this manual testing is

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,440
boring and she recognizes that you don't

00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,090
get the little green square and most

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,530
people have Hardware know a lot of start

00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,840
there's lot of assumptions with the

00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,580
hardware background where oh I know you

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,010
know this so just run it and you're fine

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,290
or set this up set up a compiler and

00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,700
you're good to go but not everyone has

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,640
that time even for getting started with

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,800
hardware and sometimes there's too many

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,810
steps involved like I said before who

00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,520
knows how to cross compile something off

00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:17,880
the top of their head or once to even

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,070
spend hours googling for that and then

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,890
within open source I've been work I've

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,690
gotten a lot of mentors mentoring really

00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:27,360
matters do you remember starting out and

00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:30,030
not knowing any where you're going do

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,180
you even have a mentor did you want one

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:35,370
if so why not if you did then what

00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,830
happened and do you want to learn

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,540
mentoring and training teaching will

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,210
force you to learn so much about a

00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:45,480
subject that you're able to give it back

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:49,410
in a more cohesive and approachable way

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,720
and kind of a word of warning about how

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:55,110
much we care and being aware of what we

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,600
actually care about I ran into an issue

00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,610
with this recently for myself at work

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,000
and I was starting to care more about a

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:04,950
project in the code involved because I

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,010
was working on it so hard and I thought

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:11,010
it would solve a lot of solutions and I

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:13,560
began to ignore something the things

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,900
like I cared most about but had just

00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,170
completely pushed him to the wayside I

00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,370
was my communication was opaque I didn't

00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,990
give proper communication or a proper

00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,550
feedback or pay attention to it as well

00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,309
from when that was getting feedback from

00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:30,430
others and I was putting so much work

00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:32,050
and care into just the project I forgot

00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:36,490
about the people and the people I had to

00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:38,200
work with we it was very embarrassing

00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:42,610
for me because I became the hypocrite of

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:45,550
my own message and it code can be easily

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,809
tossed aside and built again but

00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,940
relationship with people either

00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:50,860
professionally or personally take more

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,960
time to mend and will be proved useful

00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,410
than any line of code I'll ever writes

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,910
if anyone's ever read the ten

00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,770
commandments of the ego lyst programmer

00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,200
it applies to so many different things

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,240
and that helped me recognize what I was

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,090
actually focused on and how wrong I was

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,700
and be able to recognize and care enough

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,260
to push aside your own ego and try to

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,120
connect with others even if it means

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,880
pushing aside a project they've worked

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,540
so hard on can be difficult but

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,150
enormously helpful and contributing back

00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,890
with empathy and anything we do it could

00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,630
be just listening for a day just take a

00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,850
moment and listen to what people are

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,429
saying and understand with them apply

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,870
the examples that I've gone over we can

00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:33,220
start off small too it doesn't have to

00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,559
be everything at once you can just start

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,140
maybe just trying to put a readme in one

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:39,520
of your project repos or just starting

00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,490
to influence and ask for more code

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,490
comments or just asking for feedback

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:47,410
sincerely remaining open to sharing what

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,090
others are saying or what you're sharing

00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,460
as well and be able to communicate with

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,650
that with others and some people might

00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,920
view this and say that still sounds like

00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:58,000
a lot of work I'm sorry it's just got to

00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,100
deal with it it's something that's

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,150
really going to matter and it's

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:06,040
something that's going to benefit

00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:08,470
everyone because by applying empathy to

00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,450
what we do we can connect with other

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:14,110
professionally and then begin to

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,910
reconnect with others personally some of

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,700
my resources so my favorite resource to

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:21,520
get started especially with the type of

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,200
empathy I'm speaking about practical

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,950
empathy is a great book to start out

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,140
with nonviolent communication is really

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:31,000
helpful for recognizing those i use

00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,280
statements and realizing more about how

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,020
we communicate with people creativity

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,060
inc if you have noticed i really

00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,190
Pixar and Disney it's a great way to see

00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:42,220
how people work together creatively and

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,600
learn more from each other but I also

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:48,220
gather a bunch of resources that aren't

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:50,770
just books at this website I love the

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:56,170
URL and I was fortunate to find it more

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:59,050
empathy online and I've started it back

00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,180
when I went to jas confi you back some

00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,710
September but I've fallen to the wayside

00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:06,250
unfortunate because of other projects

00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:09,460
but I would love your help it is open

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:11,890
source and it's under my repo hipster

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,450
brown the other side of empathy and i

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,460
created a readme because i realized last

00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,140
night i did have a readme for it and so

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,080
I was like oh I gotta get this up and

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,540
get it going and your help would be

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,070
enormously helpful like if you saw

00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,900
something that helped you understand

00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:29,050
someone else it could be a blog post a

00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,580
book a video a podcast even I love

00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:33,640
podcast I learned so much from hearing

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:36,490
people talk and listening because

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,680
there's no visual distraction and it

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,390
really helps and I have some hopefully

00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,370
very helpful instruction of how to

00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,780
contribute either on the web or even

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,390
through the command line but I know not

00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:51,010
everyone is as adept with get on the

00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:54,160
command line or even locally so that's

00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:56,320
basically it I want you to go out look

00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,360
for empathy try to understand it and

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,250
connect with other people and contribute

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,260
to this list for other people to learn

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,260
from as well thank you

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,570
