Description: 
	Aaron Blythe - Ignite: Failure and the Third Way

From The Phoenix Project there are three ways. This short talk is about the all important third way, which focuses on continual improvement and taking risks.

The Third Way is about creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure; and understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery. In operations we often focus on “keeping the lights on”.

We all have Technical Debt. Technical Debt has to be paid down. But which projects should we focus on? We have to start by identifying our constraints. By focusing on our constraints we can prioritize not only the work that we release, but also the technical debt projects that should be worked. These projects are a great place to introduce the idea of a safe place to fail and iterating based on whether the desired outcome is met.

Aaron Blythe -- Failure and the Third Way >>Aaron Blythe: Hello DevOpsDays Chicago!

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:15,549
Everybody having a good time?

00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:16,549
This is a DevOps conference, so you didn't think you would get out of here without hearing

00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,300
the Phoenix project?

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:28,940
So the are three ways, the first is flow, second feedback, the third is to create a

00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,660
culture of continuous learning.

00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,700
Oh, shit.

00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:44,089
[ Laughter ]. Good thing this is a talk about failure!

00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:48,559
I want you to think about that feeling that we have right now.

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,300
We're going to do an in-talk post-mortem.

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,829
Because the feeling you have right now is how you instinctually feel about failure and

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,280
the people around you.

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,300
Sydney Decker believes that you can have a culture that blames, or you can have a culture

00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,300
that learns.

00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,399
But you can't have both.

00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:13,170
So you're going to have to choose one.

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,160
In a retribution culture, we meet hurt with hurt, and we ask these three questions: Which

00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,470
role was broken, how bad was the outcome, and what should the consequences be?

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,590
Does that sound familiar?

00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,930
Are those the questions you are asking, when you thought I failed?

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,000
And in a restoration culture, we meet hurt with healing.

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,120
We ask three questions, who is hurt, what are their needs, and whose obligation is it

00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,140
to meet those needs?

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,640
And I hope you ask those questions when you see failure.

00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,720
If you get something from my talk, see Sydney Decker, just culture, watch these 15 minute

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,200
videos with your team, management, or both and discuss what you see in these videos.

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,840
We want to work to make a restorative culture, this is where you tell your account as opposed

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,310
to pain or settling it.

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,280
You have forward-looking compatibility as opposed to backward.

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,200
You ask what is responsible as opposed to who is responsible.

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,150
This is a picture of me when I was younger doing trapeze.

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:26,460
I ate it on the last one, but that is okay because there was a safety net.

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,060
We have to make it safe to fail.

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,680
The first way is flow.

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,840
And this is what you will hear a lot about at a DevOps conference, moving things from

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,700
your business or development side through your operations out to your customer.

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,810
The second way is feedback.

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,700
And this is where you build this continuous feedback through the system so you can do

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,330
things faster, smarter, better.

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,120
But to me, the most important is the third way.

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,790
And this is to build a culture of continuous learning.

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,490
And what we've learned from Sydney Decker is you can't do this if you have a culture

00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,490
of blame.

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:08,319
So what we need to do is to eradicate, or lower the amount of blame in your organization,

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,740
which is not an easy thing to do.

00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,040
It takes a lot of trust to build that.

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,010
The DevOps handbook is a follow-on to the Phoenix project, and this has real-world stories.

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,860
In this book, there's a story from this company called Netflix.

00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
And this is a DevOps conference.

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,260
So it's always Netflix, right?

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,120
And at Netflix, there was an engineer that had taken down the system twice in the last

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,030
18 months.

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,940
I want you to ask the question what would happen at your organization if you or a teammate

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,770
took down your site twice in the last 18 months.

00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,730
Because at Netflix, this engineer was not fired.

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:55,100
This engineer was moving Netflix forward, not by miles, but by years.

00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,590
So we need cultures where we trust each other, and we have that ability to fail.

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:06,680
Because, if you don't have that ability to fail, you get hiding, secrecy, evasion, self-protection,

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,959
fingerpointing and, worst of all to me, repetition of errors that you could have otherwise learned

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,310
from.

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,359
Those are the best times to learn something is when something bad happens.

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,460
If you haven't already read Blameless Post Mortem and adjusting your craft log, that's

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,820
my second assignment.

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:31,469
I read this, it changed my live, I held 500 retrospectives in different forms over my

00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:36,099
career, and you need to listen to people.

00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:41,529
It is easy to place that blame on the sharp end, the individual, when the whole system

00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:46,789
created the failure and it has to be the option to put it on the blunt end.

00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:53,389
I'm Aaron Blythe, I want to thank you for allowing me to come to Chicago, I love Illinois,

00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,389
I grew up here.

00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:57,749
I want to thank the AV people for allowing me to seem like there was a failure, when

00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:58,819
there wasn't.

00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:03,159
You did an amazing job, I did one of these in Kansas City.

00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:10,650
If you happen to be in the area, October 25 -- 24-25, that was the first time I messed

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:17,270
up, see you there.

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,199
Bye.

00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,129
