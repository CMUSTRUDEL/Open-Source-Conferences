	Aaron Blythe - Ignite: Failure and the Third Way

From The Phoenix Project there are three ways. This short talk is about the all important third way, which focuses on continual improvement and taking risks.

The Third Way is about creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure; and understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery. In operations we often focus on “keeping the lights on”.

We all have Technical Debt. Technical Debt has to be paid down. But which projects should we focus on? We have to start by identifying our constraints. By focusing on our constraints we can prioritize not only the work that we release, but also the technical debt projects that should be worked. These projects are a great place to introduce the idea of a safe place to fail and iterating based on whether the desired outcome is met.
