Description: 
	Pete Cheslock - How to find (and retain) your hardest to hire positions

Back in the spring of 2013, I had this idea floating around in my head. I had watched so many companies spend countless time and energy in order to recruit the best staff possible. But after you were in the door, it seems like none of them really cared about how you might retain all those people you spent years investing in. I had to pleasure of giving my first conference talk ever at an event about this topic of “how to retain your hardest to hire positions”. Why do companies spend FAR more resources to hire new people, when losing any one of their existing employees would in many cases be a massive hit to the productivity of the company.

Now - 6 years has gone by. A lifetime in the technology space. To give you perspective - I gave this original talk BEFORE Docker was announced by Solomon Hykes at Pycon 2013. It can be hard to imagine a world before tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or even concepts like Serverless took over the day to day conversation. So much of HOW we get work done has changed in the last 6 years, has anything changed with how we recruit and retain our valuable employees?

Let’s revisit this talk and see what still works, what needs improvement, and new learnings from the last few years.

Pete Cheslock - How to find (and retain) your hardest to hire positions

00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:15,299
>>Pete Cheslock: All right!

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,299
Hello.

00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,299
So it is so funny, Matt asked me for a walk-on song.

00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:23,949
I had two choices, to pick a song that is good, or to troll the audience.

00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,509
I have had to listen to the Lego 2 song 2,000 times.

00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:30,199
So I thought I would share with the audience.

00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,420
I'm Pete Cheslock, the VP of products for CHAOSSEARCH.

00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,430
Who has heard of it that doesn't know who I am?

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:48,980
We are a brand-new start-up, launched in April, I started there a year ago.

00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,769
And what we basically have done is turn Elastic S3 into Elasticsearch cluster.

00:00:54,769 --> 00:01:00,000
It is a challenge that I'm passionate about, I'm a former operator, have run a lot of Elasticsearch

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,610
clusters and would love to talk about it.

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,240
You can find me on Twitter,@PeteCheslock.

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,212
I don't tweet a lot about tech stuff, mostly I got a smoker because I'm a suburban dad

00:01:14,212 --> 00:01:19,430
and I tweet about meat tweets.

00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:29,300
And so I was at Amazon, a lot of different start-ups, most you have probably not heard

00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,630
about before.

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,739
Dime DNS is one that people have heard about before, Oracle killed that, sorry Oracle.

00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:44,069
I made this change over to the product side, and I got to do this.

00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:47,880
So who here has, sorry Maddy, sorry, PagerDuty.

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,320
Who here has pager duty or is paged for their job?

00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,950
This feels as good as you think it does: Duh-lete!

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:06,069
I have yet to run into a 2:00AM emergency, I need a PowerPoint!

00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:14,200
So in 2013, which feels like a lifetime ago, but also feels like yesterday, I submitted

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,780
a talk to my first DevOpsDays, DevOpsDays Austin.

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,220
I was hashtaging and doing the Twitter right.

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:29,170
And people were talking about, I need to hire DevOps, and here is how to do it, these unicorns,

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:35,580
and nobody talked about how to keep them happy and at your company and nowhere else.

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:42,630
My talk was accepted, and I was excited, but classic fashion, I was freaking out because

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,860
I had to put this talk together.

00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,470
And in my classic move, I finished my talk the night before I had to give it.

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,569
So 2013, again, seems like a long time ago.

00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:00,330
Solomon at PyCon talked about Docker for the first time that same year.

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,200
I mean, can anyone imagine a world before Docker?

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,510
It seems like a lifetime ago.

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,890
And so, I created this talk.

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,680
The whole point of it was not only attracting the talent, but keeping them happy, keeping

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
them there.

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,940
What was most interesting, this is a slide from the old deck, it is aged a little bit,

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,650
4 by 3 instead of widescreen because PowerPoints do not support wide screen.

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,010
I did not say DevOps here, I said system engineering release automations.

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,020
I was anti the concept of DevOps as a job title.

00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:39,490
And you can see here, where people do DevOps wrong, they say, we built the DevOps team,

00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,130
it is a DevOps problem.

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,130
Just a brand-new silo.

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,890
I was annoyed with the title of DevOps.

00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,540
So, what I have basically done here is went back to the old slide deck.

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,360
And basically, I said, hey, what aged well, what didn't, what have I learned in that time?

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,459
Since that time, I have interviewed hundreds of engineers across different companies and

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,040
built sizable teams.

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,420
What were the incorrect assumptions that I had, and I will share some of the learnings.

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,319
So I like to make it a little bit of a disclaimer, that there is no one true way, no one way

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,460
to do it.

00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,840
You need a lot of different methods and techniques to recruit and retain.

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,509
Every company is different.

00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:26,720
And this is, again, based on my personal experience and conversation at events like DevOpsDays

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,360
and books and blogs and whatever.

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,090
I have been wrong a lot, I have hired the wrong people, let go good people, let good

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,699
people quit, I have screwed up a lot of times and that is a good way to learn.

00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,249
And the most important point is you cannot keep everyone at your company.

00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:49,590
Eventually, people are going to leave, it might be because of simplistic things, I wilt

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,110
get more money at this place.

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,159
They might leave because you are not giving them a challenging job, they want to grow

00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:58,010
in their career, or they want to change.

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,460
I changed a job recently to be a product person.

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,720
I was never going to get that at my previous company.

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,559
The biggest thing is that your employees are your biggest investments.

00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:13,770
This should be obvious, but the time it takes to hire, to train, to bootstrap -- losing

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,760
them is a massive bane to your business.

00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:25,560
It is hard to work for companies no one has heard of, and I have done that a lot before.

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,309
And is this the case, and it is strange to be reminding back 6 years ago.

00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:36,949
And back then, there weren't a lot of companies, as many as today, going all in on cloud.

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:42,819
I was lucky that I was at a company on Amazon in 2009, which was a little too early for

00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:45,080
Amazon.

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,610
If you wanted to do cloud stuff, there was a handful of people.

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,360
And now everybody is doing the DevOps with the Kubernetes and the cloud, everyone is

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
doing it.

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,460
It is not you have to go to this place if you want this type of job.

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,240
And back then, it was only two people addressing Chef and Ansible and puppet and now we are

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,159
in a post-config management world.

00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:14,419
And I don't think your company matters as much, because what you do from a technology

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:15,919
standpoint is largely the same.

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,460
How many of you are researching, implementing, or curious about Kubernetes?

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,059
It is a lot of people, it is most of the audience.

00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:30,520
So if you wanted a job doing Kubernetes, guess what, I'm sure there is somebody that will

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,819
hire you for that.

00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:39,819
There's a simplistic why people go to a company, the team, the technology, the money, if you

00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,240
get 2/3, you are probably happy.

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,949
From my perspective, if I have two of these, good team, good money, technology sucks, I

00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,210
will survive.

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,839
If you don't have 2 out of the 3, it will be painful.

00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,110
How has recruiting changed?

00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,749
The bad is still bad.

00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:03,339
I saw this on Twitter a while ago.

00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,349
The bad recruiters are still bad, it is a volume business.

00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:09,990
It is hard to read this, I'm just going to read it briefly.

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,960
It says, hey, Angela, I have never heard of the companies you have worked for.

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,520
She worked for Google and Class Pass, she was the founder of Class Pass, I never heard

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,089
of your school, probably okay.

00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:23,379
She went to UCLA.

00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,330
I almost didn't write this email, because I'm really busy, but why not.

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,759
Good, god, this is terrible!

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,560
So you have to treat recruiting as a long game, many years ago, before the conference

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,840
talk, it was probably 8 years ago, some friends of mine in the Boston area, I'm from Boston,

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,300
we were getting together for lunch and drinks and whatever.

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,729
We decided to get together, instead of one off meetings, and just network and chat and

00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,249
we do it once a quarter.

00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:58,589
And it has blown up into a full-blown meetup, although I'm busy and I have kids.

00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:02,860
So scheduling the meetup, it does not happen quarterly.

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:10,449
We don't do presentations or demoes, this is for people in your job that are operators,

00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,339
but it is a very wide group of people.

00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:18,629
And the joke here is that it is not that there's a Slack channel, too, and people is have have

00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:19,629
figured me out.

00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:24,619
It was a networking thing, but Pete's recruiting vehicle.

00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:32,680
I was sliding into people's DMs on Slack, I'm at this cool place, and that is part of

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,330
the networking community, there's a group of people that are on the market, right now.

00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,580
And there is no recruiter that will get to them.

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,010
And for most companies, they never get to them.

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,300
By the time that you hear they are available, they have the next job lined up.

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,920
You need to start recruiting the key people YEARS in advance.

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,541
Some of the best people I have worked with, I have started recruiting at least 2-3 years

00:08:54,541 --> 00:09:03,730
in advance, building those relationships, networking in your community, and broadly,

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,730
too.

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,730
The rise of remote work is huge.

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,009
You don't have to focus on Chicago, or the city you're from.

00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:19,370
By the time that you hear of the new thing, they have the next role out.

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:25,000
But pepper spraying candidates does not work anymore.

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,250
I was spending a lot of time talking about hiring, they were like, I thought you were

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,300
talking about retention.

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,730
You cannot keep the right people if you hire the wrong people.

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,540
If you hire the wrong people into your company, nothing will make them happy.

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,430
And the wrong hires will be destructive for your organization and sanity as well.

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,660
It can cause your best engineers to leave and a bigger problem.

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:55,319
And there's it the the concept concept of a brilliant asshole, they are just bad people

00:09:55,319 --> 00:10:00,089
and you have to get rid of them and act on it extremely fast.

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:05,920
So I keep saying the right hires, air quote there, but I want to talk about a check box

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
hire.

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,190
I hired so many people that fit this description, it is embarrassing to talk about.

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,050
Sometimes you have no other choice.

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,810
So what's a checkbox hire?

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:23,649
These are the people that you are like, I need Amazon experience, Chef, Go, Ruby, Terraform,

00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:27,389
you find a person and they check every box.

00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:31,170
This person will hit the ground running, no ramp time.

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,640
But the problem is they are experienced in everything you need.

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,920
So they will come in and they will actually not learn anything new.

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,130
And I guarantee you, in six months, they are going to be bored out of their mind.

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,389
They solved those problems at other companies.

00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:48,839
It is hard to keep them happy.

00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,190
And if you don't have anything new, you are like, sorry, we have years of work that is

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,790
in this checkbox you were hired for, and a little bit on them, they should ask, but mostly

00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,790
on you.

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,519
If you are just going straight check boxes, and this is a classic recruitic tactic, I

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,880
am hiring someone with four years of Amazon experience.

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:17,199
I like to hire for key attributes: Intellectual curiosity, and the aptitude to learn.

00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:24,779
And I found if you really keep it to these two items, they can be broad, you find people

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,509
who are curious and who like to learn.

00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:31,129
These are the attributes you need, because almost every company I started at, I did not

00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:33,829
know anything about that technology.

00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:37,550
And also, too, look at Kubernetes for example.

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,130
When Kubernetes created, there were no experts in Kubernetes.

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,199
You had to figure it out, that meant testing and trying and learning everything else.

00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:48,880
The technology will always change, finding those learners, those people that are interested

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,379
in diving in, keeps people happy and engaged.

00:11:53,379 --> 00:12:00,790
So who here has been a recipient of a white board interview process?

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,370
Is it basically the worst thing you have ever done?

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,209
It is terrible, I have been a part of those as well.

00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,709
I will never, ever do a white board interview.

00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:17,610
If you are a hiring manager, or you work for a large search engine-based company, and it

00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,199
ends in oogle, you have to stop doing that.

00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,890
It is a terrible way to hire people and it pisses everyone off.

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,990
What can you do instead?

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,370
You want to gauge this person's ability on a technical side.

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,290
What we did at a previous company, we creaed a clearly-defined project, a time box, aligned

00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:47,350
with a role, you don't give me this blah blah, computer terms, and if something is part of

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:54,000
their role, you time box it, and see how far they can go.

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,930
So build an API server.

00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,189
If you are a DevOps person, why would I build an API server?

00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:01,790
A lot of what you do is probably interacting with APIs.

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,199
And building a basic API server is easier than you think it is.

00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:11,560
So what we said is, build an API server that responds to one end point only, written in

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,430
any language.

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,779
When you hit the end point, it responds with the current time.

00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,100
And at four hours, just stop.

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,449
And there is something that I desperately want to do, and I heard rumors out there that

00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:27,730
there are companies solving this, I want to pay people to do this task.

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,839
It is four real hours of time.

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,279
But the tax implications of paying the people you are interviewing is weird.

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,000
I heard rumors that gift cards work, there is no tax thing, I hope to have an open space

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
after.

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,550
If you want to know more about this, let me know.

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,400
I would love to pay people for it, because it is work.

00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,360
And then we also made it escalating difficulty as well.

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,889
Okay, give me another end point, a time zone conversion.

00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:55,329
And then another was, deploy it somewhere.

00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:01,459
So you think, did they deploy it to Heroku, did they spin up an easy two instance, run

00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:05,089
a server somewhere, did they spin up 10 servers of Kubernetes and deploy it there?

00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:11,110
It didn't matter how or when, just taking it to the next level.

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,829
Add SSL support, etc.

00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:20,269
We had an individual that didn't write any code, but 10 pages of documentation on their

00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,680
thought process on how they are trying to solve this problem.

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,019
It was so clear and well-written that we hired them on the spot.

00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,660
It didn't matter whether or not they completed it.

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,690
We wanted to see how you think, how did you get through it?

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,020
So from my previous slide, I had this one, losing people sucks.

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,529
And spoiler alert, it is still the worst.

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:44,720
It is terrible and it cuts deeper when it is something that is avoidable.

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,890
So why do we lose people in the first place?

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,490
Well, I think there are these items here that drive, and there's a great book by Daniel

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,490
Ping called drive.

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,360
He talks about autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:04,459
And these items, if you can have at least one or two, that is great, to keep people

00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:05,459
engaged and happy.

00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:10,230
You have to feel like your work is meaningful, that you are becoming a master of a, an expert,

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,940
and you have autonomy and you can derive value from what you are doing.

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,360
I had a slide about autonomy, I took a picture of my daughter on my computer, because I thought

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
it was hilarious.

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,680
I said this line, and I said, I tell my kids what to do, not my engineers.

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,660
And the reality is that it is not a, you know, hey, you do this, you do that.

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:37,490
It is, let's have a discussion and let's understand what needs to get done and how we prioritize

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,800
that.

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,240
That's a great way to have people feel like they have control over their job, they are

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,710
guiding the work -- that you have a piece of infrastructure and nobody is listening

00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,990
to you.

00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,069
You make mistakes, course correct, and it is a back and forth process.

00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:03,029
And this being a long time ago, I said to my daughter, can we -- I will show how many

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,470
years ago it was.

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,390
It is not the same laptop, it is a totally different one.

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,430
There's a lot of stickers on it.

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,189
And I was excited because she never listens to me, this was the first time she was like,

00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,709
yeah, I will do that.

00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,579
So we got to capture this.

00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:22,129
So if I'm not telling people what to do, how do I get work done?

00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:27,069
If you try to align work with an owner and back off and give them the ability to complete

00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,290
the task and get it done.

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,069
It is not that you let them off into their own little world for six month and have them

00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:34,180
do what they are doing.

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,499
You are continually checking in.

00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:38,120
How many people have a one on one with the direct manager?

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,689
Keep your hand up, do you have that weekly?

00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:48,160
So having a weekly one on one is huge, it should not be, hey, how is this project going,

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,730
it should start with, how are you doing?

00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:57,740
And then let's talk about projects, how you are doing, are you having issues, do you need

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:04,650
support, training, somebody did a talk on taking time at your job to read a book and

00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,650
learn something.

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,650
I that is awesome.

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:12,990
So mastery, it means getting better at something that matters to you, not to the other person.

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,020
And then there's the concept of continuous learning, we are learning new things and trying

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,100
to get better.

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:24,650
This is not just technical skills, but management and leadership training, writing, a lot of

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,730
things that people, in a technical role, honestly probably should get better at.

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,230
I joke that I think more technical people should take a business class, or a finance

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,480
class, do you know how your company makes money, it is shocking how many engineers don't

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,950
know.

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:46,830
If you are at a company that sells a product, go to a demo and watch how they sell it to

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,830
another person.

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,730
You might be amazed or horrified.

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,560
Any piano players in here?

00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,730
This is a perfect picture of, when you become a master, you suddenly don't enjoy it anymore.

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:10,060
Be part of something that matters to you, and not, oh, this is a big deal, it has to

00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,490
matter to the person.

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,490
So no one has ever has ever said this, that code will go into a hole that is not wasted.

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:24,390
Writing code that is notes used is demoralized, if you had an awesome thing, nothing is worse

00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:31,970
than them telling you that we had a shift in priorities, which is code for that's not

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,970
getting done.

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,720
And open source projects, I talked about this six years ago and it is more important now,

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,370
it is easier to give ownership, easy to recruit people, the costs are minimal, although if

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,790
it is popular, it can be a lot.

00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,500
But the more popular they are, a bigger recruiting effort for you.

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,600
The benefits are massive.

00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,890
How many of you have heard of a tool, Sensu, a monitoring framework?

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,360
I talked a lot about companies that people have never heard of before.

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,470
More people in here have heard of Sensu versus the company that created it.

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,910
I was at a company that was very angry with Nagios.

00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:20,270
It did not scale to handle dynamic workloads in the cloud, we built this open source project,

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:29,030
they are now a company and it is really cool, and that helped engage the engineers that

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:34,150
were extremely hard to find and kept them at the company that went nowhere.

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:39,340
And how you keep the company excited is working on projects like this to move the business

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,340
forward.

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,630
How many of you are remote workers?

00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:53,670
Is this a slide from my deck, six years ago, it is harder to hire people.

00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,200
And talent beats location any day of the week.

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,570
The manager of that person is responsible for their output, not the location.

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:08,940
And not everyone can work from home, but it shouldn't matter where people are contributing

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
from.

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,650
And this is from the slide six-plus years ago.

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,980
It is funny how this aged really not well.

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,500
[ Laughter ]. Like IRC, Skype, Google hangouts is done,

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,680
it is Google meet, Hip Chat, they are gone.

00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:33,590
It is basically GitHub.

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,860
Slack has taken over the world, and it is never going away.

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,450
So now we have to talk about money.

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,550
Because this is a key part of employer retention.

00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,990
And I actually, I just talked about this on Twitter.

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,010
I was like, why do you like this company?

00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,940
Because you pay me.

00:20:51,940 --> 00:21:00,410
So I hate this slide, and I have heard it before, and it is self-selecting, and everyone

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,820
takes a paycut to come here.

00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,240
It is the classic work for exposure thing.

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,730
And I think the line is, you don't work for exposure, people die of exposure.

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,050
[ Laughter ]. And the problem with a paycut to work here

00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,560
is that, another company is going to pay you more which, guess what, they will.

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,060
And if another company is willing to do an above market, and guess what, they are.

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:27,210
Then that above market salary offer is a massive bump.

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:32,031
Who would not change jobs if you are talking a 20 to 30 percent raise, I think you would

00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:33,930
have a really hard time doing that.

00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,950
It is just a cheap way of doing business and it opens the door.

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,770
If you under pay an engineer to $80,000 a year, and that's the going rate for your city

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:47,070
is $100,000, there will always be a company that will overpay to bring them on.

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,990
There is a company with more money than you, and they will use it.

00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,780
And so basically, you have to take the issue of money off the table.

00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,360
If the fact is that you can always go make more money somewhere else, as basically the

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,990
receiver of the money, I say to myself, listen, it has to be enough where I don't think about

00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,990
it.

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,990
I don't feel like I'm underpaid.

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,400
It would be great to have more money!

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,980
But you have to have it just be enough to take that issue off the table.

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:18,280
And, now, the talk day, the open space we did the other day, if you showed me a list

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,690
of employee salaries at a start up, and it is any non public start-up, I can tell you

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,520
how long they have been employed there.

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
I almost guarantee you.

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,920
The people at a start up, when they come on today, are paid market.

00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,590
Two years ago, paid less, four years ago, even lower.

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:42,370
And start ups are notoriously bad at going back and correcting those mistakes.

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,140
How many of you have heard, we cannot give that engineer a $20,000 raise?

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,840
Or they will be suspicious?

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,550
Nobody will be suspicious.

00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:57,710
You can tweet them like adults, tell them, you are paid less than market, we are fixing

00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,780
that.

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,920
I would be happy about that..

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:11,510
Another critical metric, STPR, the shit-to-pay ratio [ laughter ]. There is somebody that

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:17,150
will pay you more for what you do today, so what do you have to put up with to do it?

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:24,920
If you take the job for more money, there's a ratio, the shit-to-pay ratio.

00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,260
Under pay your engineers at your own risk.

00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,440
And this is important today, it was important six years ago, it will be important five or

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,420
10 years from now.

00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:39,680
And companies fall down on this so hilariously, if this is the one thing you do at your company,

00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,500
you are beating out 90 percent of the market.

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,850
And, you know, people say, well, we just don't want to hire people for money, they want to

00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,120
be here for the cause.

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,790
I'm here for the cause, I have a mortgage and kids to go to camp and 300 other things.

00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,870
Your company, what you do, is probably not special.

00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,460
You are doing Kubernetes on AWS?

00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,460
Cool.

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,290
Everyone is doing the same thing.

00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:07,200
And then we have, this is my favorite one, no, we underpay because you get stock options.

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,120
You can get rich here!

00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,080
[ Laughter ]. I have a bunch of slides here, I cannot stop

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,230
too long to laugh at that one.

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,720
Here is the deal about stock options, you need to ask yourself these questions, if there

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,860
of them are yes, that is probably a good one.

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,730
Are you a founder?

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,290
Your founders have, when the company starts, if there are two founders, they have 50 percent

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,020
of the company.

00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,830
When investors come in, they have 40 or 30 percent.

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:40,160
You can see when the start-ups files the S1, there are 2 people or maybe 3 that hold a

00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,260
single percentage at that point.

00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,640
Unless you are crazy, like Slack or something, and some of these companies that have grown

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
really fast.

00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,290
But further down, in a start-up, it goes the founders, and then the next hire, if you got

00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:58,290
one percent of that company, that would be CRAZY.

00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,760
From there, if you are like an engineer, maybe you are the first one, 1 percent, and maybe

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,700
the next, a half or a 10th of a percent, and then next, you just get 10,000 shares, which

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,270
means nothing.

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,110
Were you granted restricted stock?

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,730
Most likely, you were not, you were given stock or a set of stock options.

00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,190
If you are given restricted stock, that is stock, they give it to you.

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,510
Why don't companies do that?

00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,850
You have to pay for it, or they gift it to you, which is basically income.

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:32,600
And there's not a lot of people, taking a new job, that are willing to pay 10 or $20,000

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,250
to buy the shares in.

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:42,020
This exists for the founders, when you start the company, the value is zero.

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,840
When you come in anytime after, they have a value.

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
Does the grant have protections for change and control?

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:58,030
If the company is acquired, do -- and you get fired, do you get all your shares?

00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,570
That is important to keep in mind.

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,570
New CEOs that are fired, I see that clause in.

00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:08,860
And if a new CEO comes in, I need to bring in the sales people, we need that protection.

00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,760
Is there a convertible node?

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,180
There's debt on company and different ways of deletion and debt wins.

00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,340
And that's why tech people need to take a business class, if you understand how businesses

00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:25,850
are funded, it is really easy for the shares you think you have a lot of to get diluted

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,540
to nothing.

00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:33,121
And there's the concept of liquidation preference, my favorite one, if the VC is going into a

00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:36,910
start up, I take it out first.

00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:43,900
If you put in 10 million, sold for 100, I take 10 out and the 90 is split up between

00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,210
all of us, including me.

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:51,310
If sometimes the company is not doing too well, the preference is 2X, 3X, or 4X.

00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:58,140
So if I say I will put in 10 million, I want a 5X multiple, we are sold for $50 million,

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,860
and I will take out the money and nobody gets anything, including the founders.

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:08,420
So you can see why your stock options are not going to work.

00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,240
You will probably not get rich aft this start up, it does not mean you can not make money

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,590
in other ways.

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:23,790
If you work for a public company, this does not apply, you can give stock and sell it

00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,030
and take the cash and run.

00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,350
I did all these things you said, someone left anyway.

00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,801
Guess what, congratulate them.

00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:34,150
That is pretty awesome.

00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:39,850
Ask them for honest feedback, and don't ask them for the feedback unless you are ready

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,850
for it.

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,850
You might not like it.

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,290
But you should understand what the reasons are.

00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,620
I'm leaving because you are a terrible manager, as we talked about many times, you're a terrible

00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,150
manager, that's why I'm leaving.

00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:55,340
But, hey, this role was new and different and I wasn't going to get it here.

00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,330
That's awesome.

00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:01,560
If you have been in this business for long enough, it comes around again.

00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,980
There have been people I worked with 10 or 20 years ago, I come back around and worked

00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,430
with them in the past.

00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:16,500
Stay connected with them, 2 or 4 years from now, you will hire them again.

00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,570
So the other thing I like to talk about here as well is the concept of a counter offer.

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,530
If someone comes to you with an offer in hand and they are ready to go, my opinion is I

00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,820
never offer a counter offer.

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,740
And that's maybe unpopular opinion, I know some people use it as a way to get more money,

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,850
which you should absolutely do that.

00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,860
Always try to get the most for what you are doing there.

00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,000
But the problem I always have with a counter offer is that person is already mentally there.

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,210
They are looking at the paper and they see that dollar amount, or maybe the opportunity.

00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,820
They are mentally there.

00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,260
And it gets weird, if you have ever taken the counter offer and stayed, it is weird.

00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,110
It is always weird.

00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,580
So I never -- I never extend them out.

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,490
I had engineers get upset because they thought I was going to.

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:07,600
If it comes to a money thing, as a manager, I want to know that in advance.

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,800
I've had engineers say, hey, I have been here a while, looking that market, I think it is

00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
higher.

00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,540
On the talk pay thing, there's a spreadsheet I believe is going to be shared, use that

00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:23,970
information to get a raise, but that is different than, I'm changing jobs.

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:29,390
If I think someone is leaving, I cannot provide them with what they want.

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,721
At the end of the day, people excel when they are excited about their work, there are high

00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:38,540
levels of trust across the organization, they have personal ownership, that responsibility,

00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:44,840
that they are making something better, and the responsibility to affect change in an

00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
organization.

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,530
So, just to really distill it down, people need to be challenged, there needs to be ownership

00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,390
across the employees, high levels of trust on both sides, you have to trust they get

00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,520
the work done, and that you will get out of their way.

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,400
If you're a manager, you're the shit umbrella, you have to keep it up there to help your

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,590
engineers do what they need to do and get it completed.

00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:13,450
That does not mean hide everything up here, but making sure they are not distracted, context

00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,770
switching all over the place.

00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:22,130
If you give the worst work to that person because they will take it with a smile on

00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:26,490
their face and do that work, don't be surprised when they leave.

00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,060
Because they will just ghost, they will be gone.

00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,280
I think it works until it doesn't, and it is pretty bad.

00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,540
At the end of the day, tweet them like adults.

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,520
And it seems like such a basic thing, you are like, I'm going to treat these adults

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,450
as adults, but it is funny how often times companies spend this time, energy, money,

00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,970
hiring these capable, intelligent individuals into the business and then micromanage them

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,730
to the end of the day -- these are highly-paid professionals, you have to tweet them like

00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,180
the skilled adults they are.

00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,660
For open spaces later, I would love to talk about stock options.

00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,360
If you are thinking about going to start-up, if you are at a start-up, I have been through

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,950
this so many times.

00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:12,510
I have learned the hard way many times on all the different ways, things you might want

00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,510
to say.

00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:18,570
So keep an eye out for that later, I would love to chat more about stock options to help

00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,100
everyone out with that.

00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,710
That's all I have, thank you very much.
