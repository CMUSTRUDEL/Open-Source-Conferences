	Heidi Waterhouse - Ignite: Deploying Radically, Democratizing Release

The best practice we know is driving to get software out the door more quickly, at an ever-accelerating pace. We admire companies doing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, even if we aren’t there ourselves. What can you do to make your software ready for the world more quickly?

The state of software is driving to get software out the door more quickly, an ever-accelerating pace. We admire companies doing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, even if we aren’t there ourselves. What can you do as one person in an organization or one team in a company to make your software ready for the world more quickly?

This brief talk will cover these concepts:

Release vs. Deployment
Feature flags
CI/CD requirements
Ring deployment
Flags for all departments!

Heidi Waterhouse -- Deploying radically, democratizing release.

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:15,549
>>Heidi Waterhouse: Hello, this is a punishment for me being late.

00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:19,900
I'm Heidi Waterhouse, and I'm here to talk about deploying radically, and democratizing

00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,900
release.

00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,740
I think it is super exciting, I was explaining this to my team last night when we met up

00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:41,510
at a really fancy restaurant, Avian -- drop in audio -- release is 

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,570
something different.

00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:49,059
So let's talk about Martin Luther and Che Guevara and what they have in common, a lot

00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:55,160
of them don't think they have a lot in common, one a constipated churchman and the other

00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,120
a cranky revolutionary, but they are both radicals.

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,610
They saw the value of change, looked at the system around them, they said, this sucks

00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:12,670
and I would like to change it for a lot of people, all at once.

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,510
Given this, this is what they wanted to change.

00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,830
They believed in universal literacy, everybody should read.

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,500
They wanted marriageable clergy, Che didn't know why we had clergy, but they should get

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,850
married, and overthrow corrupt leaders.

00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:39,720
In democratic release, people are empowered, people get to push things into production

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,030
and let them out into the world to test them and we don't need a ton of controls on that.

00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,140
We don't need to say that everything has to run through everybody.

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,489
And that's pretty scary for people who living in controlled and regulated industries, but

00:01:55,489 --> 00:02:00,170
the thing is, we need to control what gets out to the public.

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,360
Democratic release is like a reverse online, you want to pull it out and see the release

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,229
for myself.

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,220
That's the thing about and onlines, they are powerful.

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,250
If anybody can stop the line, why not start the line?

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,020
Release is about business needs, it is about money, release is about the things that we

00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:40,270
are doing to make money with our software -- 

00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,270
drop in audio -- revenue.

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,940
It doesn't matter how many customers you have, if they are not paying you money.

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,670
Sorry, that's just the way it works.

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,470
Sometimes we have customers who pay us money some day, and we are excited about that.

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,030
On the whole, if they are not getting value, they are not paying us money.

00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,700
We want to talk about getting money.

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,890
So Martin Luther says, what if the people could self serve?

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,290
He wants them to self serve religion, but I want to be able to say your customers can

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,940
self serve their own software, they can say I want that feature or I don't want that feature.

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,670
Power to the people, right?

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,390
Che says dissempowerment leads to disengagement.

00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,410
If you don't have the power to do something, you kind of check out.

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:30,120
If you can never push to production or you can never see your stuff live, we check out.

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,600
So how do we liberate the code from the constraints of the Catholic church, capitalism, or the

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
change board?

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,300
We are nice people, but how do we get out from under them?

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,050
How do we get it out in the wild?

00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,830
Well, feature flags.

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,700
I want you to be able to say everything is deployed, everything is possible, the world

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:58,090
is your oyster, all you have to do is decide who to turn it on for.

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,400
And so, I need to tell you what a feature flag is.

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,970
The simplest explanation I have come up with so far is a feature flag is a way to control

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,950
code after you deploy it.

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:15,319
After it is out in the world, you can change how it behaves.

00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,030
Martin says, we all deserve grace.

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,690
Everybody deserves this power and beautiful release.

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:31,251
And Che says something very similar when you think about it: We all deserve rights, we

00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:35,759
all deserve this power, and this capacity.

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:43,990
And I think software is a place that we could be more libratory, we can be more reformtory,

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,610
we can do more to make it individualized.

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:56,460
So Toggle our mascot says go faster, be safer, and include everyone in the business decisions

00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,479
of who gets to see software, including the customers.

00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:02,220
This is my link for getting the free t-shirt.

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:08,090
Again, we are always hiring, we are starting to look at remote hires.

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,870
If you have not applied before, you can try it again.

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:19,270
Thank you very much for your time.

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:26,669
