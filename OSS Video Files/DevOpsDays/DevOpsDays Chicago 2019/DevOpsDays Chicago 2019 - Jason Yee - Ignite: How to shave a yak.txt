	Jason Yee - Ignite: How to shave a yak

In the IT world, we often talk about “Yak Shaving” - term to describe a chain of tasks that seem unrelated, but which are required in order to accomplish your primary goal.

When I mentioned this term to a group of well-seasoned knitters, they all exclaimed that you shouldn’t shave yaks. I was quickly informed that yak fiber (the industry term for yak hair) is one of the most expensive and prized materials to knit with. But in order for yak fiber to be useful, you need to collect it in the proper way.

In this ignite talk, I’ll share lessons that we can learn about Yak Shaving from the experts who actually care for yaks, collect their fiber and produce some of the worlds best yarn; and the knitters who turn it into clothing and other goods.

Jason Yee -- How to shave a yak >> Okay, as we are making our way in, everybody

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
have a good lunch, fajitas?

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
We were coming up with a microservice joke about loose interfaces.

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Time for ignits, this is a lot more entertaining than me, this is awesome.

00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Ignite talks are a little different than your standard talk, they are 5 minutes long, they

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,500
are composed of 20 slides of auto advance, every 15 seconds, so the presenter has no

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,500
control over what happens.

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
It's a lot of fun, maybe it is stressful, maybe it is not.

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
The beautiful thing if you are wanting to give a talk, some folks tell you that ignite

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
is a good way to start, it is short, it is challenging, but if it is rough, it is only

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,500
5 minutes and then it is over.

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,500
You have a 45 minute talk that is rough, you have up there sweating for a long time.

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
So we're going to start by bringing up the ignite speakers and introducing each of them,

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
and then we will go down the line and we will see what they can teach us each in 5 minutes

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,500
alone!

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
So the speakers, c'mon up.

00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
And we will -- I should have said that already.

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
It is good.

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
So first, we have Jason Yee, followed by -- well, any order that you are walking up.

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Followed by Heidi Waterhouse, Aaron Blythe, Martez Reed, and finishing us off is Joshua

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Zimmerman!

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,500
So Jason, I will give you the mic.

00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500
>>Jason yee: Shoo them offstage.

00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Awesome, I get to be up here and say silly things.

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Maybe I will talk about fire, or how to shave a yak.

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Who has heard the term yak shaving?

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
That is most of you.

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Who has done some yak shaving this week?

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Well, that's -- that's a fair number of hands.

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Not as many as I expected.

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
For those who don't understand the term, and are confused, yak shaving refers to the series

00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
of seemingly endless tasks you have to do.

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,620
You have to do task A, but to do task A, you have to do task B, and to do that, there's

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,080
a prerequisite for that, you have to do task C. When I mentioned yak shaving to my girlfriend's

00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,120
group, they were mortified, you don't shove yaks!

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,539
That's what you do in the DevOps world.

00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:16,170
This is Sophia Weiss, a yak farmer, she has a yak farm in Ashland, Oregon, on the California

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,970
border and graciously shared tips on shaving yaks for me.

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:31,670
I would like to introduce you to JasonCarcuttaB126, a cute name.

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,100
And I asked Sophia about the name, just rolls off the tongue.

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:47,480
The first is the farm code, the yak's name, and the ID number that has the year the yak

00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,810
was born.

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,549
Yak farmers track the sire and the dam, the father and the mother, because tracking the

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,799
lineage of the yak explains why it is the way it is, not just the physical appearance,

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,500
what the fur is like, but also how it behaves.

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,171
So when you're actually going about your yak shaving, you should track your tasks, not

00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:18,010
just what it is, but where it came from, what is the higher-level goal that this is supposed

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,970
to unblock?

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,230
When was this made, who made it?

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,060
Without this information, you lose the context of why you're doing that task to begin with.

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,629
How many times that you've done that, you started on yak shaving, you are doing a thing,

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:32,870
and why was I doing this?

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,670
You never know when to stop going down the chain if you don't know the context.

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:47,400
The knitting group was right, you don't shave yaks, because yaks grow down fiber that keeps

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,489
their bodies warm for the winter.

00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:58,110
They use a special tool, an undercoat rake, a brush, and that separates the fur out from

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,940
the outer guard hair, the course hair on the outside of the yak.

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,850
So when you separate it out, it allows you to make the super soft yarn that knitters

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,370
love.

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,909
So you don't shave yaks, when you shave it off, all of it comes off, you have the outer

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,710
hair and the soft hair and you can no longer make the nice yarn.

00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:27,720
It is enticing, when working on tasks, to build the perfect solution, architect the

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,940
perfectly well-built application.

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,620
But you don't need that to unblock your tasks, you need to learn to start to brush your yaks,

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,150
just like real yaks.

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,560
Only do enough to unblock what you originally were working on.

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,730
Otherwise, you are just going to end up creating more yaks as you build these perfect solutions.

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:56,300
So I was talking with Sophia, and she mentioned that farms, like in tech, there is way too

00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,860
much to do and not enough people to do it.

00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,700
They have unplanned incidents, like we do, that cause extra work.

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,740
And, you know, doing capacity planning, planning to have workers on hand really helps.

00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,500
Having the right infrastructure really helps.

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,010
But even, with all that, it all boiled down to she said -- if you are dealing with fancy

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:26,050
yaks, when you are dealing with complex systems, sometimes you end up having to shave yaks.

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,870
But the one thing that is notable about this is that shaving yaks does not mean what we

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,870
think it means.

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,280
It does not refer to the endless chain of tasks.

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,020
It's this: It is flipping that table over, burning everything down, and starting over.

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,210
It is what I call extreme refactoring.

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,139
Just do it again.

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:52,240
Because you end up with naked yaks, and naked yaks have to grow hair.

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,930
As you start thinking about yak shaving, number one, track your yaks, your tasks, and understand

00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,050
when you should stop.

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,330
Brush them, only do enough, and avoid the shaving, because shaving does not mean what

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,740
we think it means.

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm Jason, I work At Datadog, we build observability tools, we have a ton of yaks that need brushing.

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:24,320
If you need opportunities and like yaks, come and talk to me later.

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,910
Thanks.

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,500
