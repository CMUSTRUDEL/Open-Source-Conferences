	Jay Gordon - Ignite: What I Learned From A Dress, an On-Call Nightmare

In 2015 the viral internet moment of “The Dress” occurred that completely changed what I knew about deploying production web servers. As the on-call resource over the evening I saw web traffic that peaked at 670,000 active visitors on BuzzFeed.com. In this talk, I share lessons on the moment.

After a day of managing a physical data center build and dealing with a bunch of llamas getting loose in Los Angeles, I came home to what I hoped was an average evening. After a meal and a quick shower my phone began blowing up with alerts. My wife was sitting on the couch and turned to me, and asked “oh is that about the dress?” I ask her, “what dress?”

A dress was shared on the internet that people seemed enamored with due to a visual trick that caused people to see the dress in different colors. This set off a huge interest in sharing what people thought the color was. BuzzFeed’s editorial team quickly used a NoSQL backed database app to quickly capture votes from the dress crazed masses.

There was one big problem, no one could do anything else. The rest of the website’s backend failed causing front end servers to no longer be able to serve new web traffic.

After a several hour alert incident and various remediation's the team I worked with were able to place a reasonable fix in order to keep the mass of traffic coming to our app for collecting people’s votes. The toll an incident like this takes on a team is tremendous. I can explain how old ideas with trusted technology can still lead to failure that can’t be predicted.

Attendees should also take away an understand of the human cost of toil in a team when you’re not sure how the traffic is going to come.

Jay Gordon - What I Learned From A Dress, an On-Call Nightmare

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,780
>>Jay Gordon: Hey, how is it doing, Chicago?

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,780
So what I learned from a dress.

00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,180
It is an oncall nightmare, it is something we're going to talk about.

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,509
And I hope you enjoy the story.

00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:29,369
So first and foremost, I will wait for a minute, there it is.

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,071
That's me, Jay, I'm an ops professional, I work in Microsoft, this is my one-year anniversary.

00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:39,410
And one of the coolest things that I have learned is storytelling.

00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,070
It is what makes working in this DevOps field interesting.

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,530
And so I just -- I started, I decided to start a podcast.

00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,460
And I called it on-call nightmares, because I wanted to collect all your stories.

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,050
I wanted to hear what you have been through.

00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,300
And then I decided, I'm coming to DevOps days Chicago, I'm telling my story.

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:08,110
My podcast has three rules, do not incriminate yourself, others, and help us learn.

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,520
I think of us as being blameless and having retrospectives.

00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,710
That's what the story is about.

00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:21,890
This is my story, I worked at Buzzfeed, part of the ops team, it was a regular day, I was

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:32,090
building mongo racks in the data center, on call for alerts, and then suddenly, llamas!

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,090
That's right.

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,259
So how does a bunch of llamas impact my day?

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,159
Well, simply stated, there were a pair of llamas that went on the run.

00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:54,090
You know, a real Jay-Z and Beyonce thing, and the internet, of course, went ape shit.

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,640
That's what the internet does, when you see ridiculous things that make people interesting,

00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,420
they create viral moments, and alerts explode, right?

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,859
So a lot of times, you are on the floor of the data center, and you are figuring out

00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:12,010
why the alerts are exploding and we figured out that we had so much technical debt.

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:20,360
So much time was spent, and we built a system that couldn't handle the amount of traffic

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,090
that we had.

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,860
And so what do you do about that?

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,120
You stop, think, this is our technical debt, we will make remediations.

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,319
So I went home.

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,360
And do the things that we all do when we get home, 8:30PM, the pager goes off.

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,530
My wife asked, is this because of the dress?

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,850
[Deep sigh].

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,620
I asked what dress, and this is the dress.

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:59,769
I kept alerts from my boss, and you can see that things were really pissed off.

00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:06,319
And for those of you that don't know what the dress phenomenon was, it created 670,000

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,800
active connections per second on a lamp, and that P stood for PERL.

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,129
So sorry.

00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:21,190
And it all started with the most interesting thing, Kay, a wonderful woman, worked for

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:28,720
Tumblr and now at Buzzfeed and said in an email, can you settle the argument for us?

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:39,430
What happened, alerts explode, because Kay put out a viral post, because holy shit, there's

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,819
a dress, nobody knows what color it is.

00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:52,060
The internet does what it is, and I get more alerts, and pager notices, yeah, you're screwed.

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,750
[ Laughter ]. So what do we do?

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:11,750
We start recognizing that we reached a really, really bad point and this is supposed 

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:21,220
to be -- >> This is what came up when the PERL app

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,690
would go to hell.

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:31,800
And Ben Smith, the editor of buzz Feed said we can't do anything, we tied everything together

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,860
and assumed capacity.

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,310
That's the whole DevOps part of this.

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:44,690
We assumed that a capacity, because I'm not going to name names, we kept blameness, because

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:50,720
people didn't want to use the systems through auto scaling they didn't trust.

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,370
So we assumed the clothes rack we had was enough for the dress, and obviously it wasn't.

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,090
We had a huge request from people to wear that dress.

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:07,190
The thing I learned, this is how I will wrap up, is you need to be ready to restock and

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,840
reassess when the season's hot style is unexpectedly in demand.

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:26,370
It could create a nightmare, so thanks, love you all.

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:26,770
