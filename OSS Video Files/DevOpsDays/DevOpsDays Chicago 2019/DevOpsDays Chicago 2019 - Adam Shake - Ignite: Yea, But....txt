	Adam Shake - Ignite: Yea, But...

How often have we suggested a change and “Yea, But..”. It could be DevOps or a new tool, but you always get an excuse why “That won’t work here” or “We don’t have time”. Lets explore the ways people make these excuses, and then some ways to overcome them. All while having a little fun!

Adam Shake - Yea, But >>Adam shake: I work for Mediamath, and they

00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,660
hire me to direct their cyber reliability engineering team.

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,560
I think that is appropriate, because I wasn't working for them when they sent me to do this

00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,449
talk, and yet, they sent me, as well, and I don't have to do DevOps anymore.

00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:42,640
So that's cool.

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,930
But no, really.

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:51,309
Clearly, at least in my mind, and in many minds, the simbiosis means between those worlds

00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:52,850
are very important.

00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,330
I'm excited to talk about this subject.

00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,570
And put yourself into this situation, maybe you will have it today.

00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:08,750
You go to an incredible conference, SRE Con, a developer conference, DevOpsDays Chicago,

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,390
or an incredible DevOpsDays conference.

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,979
And you sit in rooms like this and hear from people more exciting than me talk about incredible

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:20,979
things.

00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:25,590
We had incredible speakers, and you are excited about the things you are hearing.

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:37,140
Hopefully many of you are sitting in your seats right now -- and I'm pumped to do all

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,289
of the things.

00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:44,409
So you get back to the boss, you want to do this, and maybe you are lucky that the boss

00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:50,920
came with, you do this, and he says, yeah, PowerPoint, that's what you are going to do.

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,960
So you have to create the read-out PowerPoint, you have to create the deck that tells everybody

00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,210
what you learned and they are going to know it all from the PowerPoint.

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,990
You will share it with the team, the leadership team, who knows.

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,420
You are getting head nods, thumbs up, everyone is excited and you get to the end and there's

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,540
a call to action, we will do what we just talked about.

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,450
And the face goes from the thumbs up to the grumpy cat.

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:25,410
This is where you start to get the first instances of this phrase that I cannot stand.

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:34,420
So the boss starts to wield his power, and you get that first, yeah, but....

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,080
And what is that, right?

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,150
You hear yeah, but... whatever.

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:45,110
Yeah, that won't work, we can't do that and there are excuss.

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,420
Why are you getting yeah, but?

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,850
You are getting that because people are resistant to change.

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,670
The person you are trying to convince to do things in a better, faster, more efficient

00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,860
way is used to the way they have done it.

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,920
You have an excuse, what are the common excuss?

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,260
Yeah, we're too big, yeah, we're too small, and the funny thing is, when you hear that

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,900
from the same organization.

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,730
And it does happen, I heard enough laughs to know you have heard it.

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,100
There are others, right?

00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,390
Yeah, but we don't have to time to do that, or we don't have budget, or yeah, but that

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:29,690
won't work for my, insert whatever, my infrastructure team, my waterfall project, my... whatever

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,690
that might be.

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,070
So what are you supposed to do?

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,960
You heard yeah, but... how do you overcome that?

00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,620
That's what I'm talking about.

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:47,350
It is not a secret, but at the core of everything we do in DevOps, in SRE, and as developers,

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:52,800
there's one thing that has to exist, many of us are bad at it, all of us can be great

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
at it.

00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,310
That is how you deal with the yeah, buts, and any of the excuss and it boils down to

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,280
relationships.

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,110
You have to go out and build relationships with the people in your organization to have

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,210
the conversation that allows you to affect that change.

00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:17,350
You can't just go be directive, or share your excitement in this vomit of awesomeness and

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,780
expect people to want to do it.

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,090
So you have to go and have the real conversations, and uncover pain points.

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,660
People are experiencing stress and pain in the organization because of existing practices,

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,880
uncover them, look for new wins, find folks that are excited.

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,650
You have to have these conversations.

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,599
Small wins are critical.

00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:43,650
You go out and find the things for little to no money, time, or permission, and start

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,870
to do those things.

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,969
Solve those problems first, and then you will get someone else as excited as you were when

00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:52,050
you got back.

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,150
If you can start to build excitement, over time, you will build a groundswell for how

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,259
you are going to change your organization and it all comes back to that relationship.

00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:12,240
So that is my time, I want to thank you for having me talk, enjoy the rest of the ignites.

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,580
