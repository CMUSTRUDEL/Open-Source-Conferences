	J. Paul Reed - Ignite: Attempting to Bring Blamelessness to Traffic Court

The new interest in the ideas surrounding blameless retrospective culture and examining the deep role human factors play in our work is changing the way the technology industry understands and responds to service-impacting incidents.

But what would happen if we took these ideas to traffic court? Would they be as understanding about this type of “incident” as we strive to be about ours? And just which modern incident analysis techniques might be useful in traffic court? Come find out!

J. Paul Reed - Attempting to Bring Blamelessness to Traffic Court

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,070
>>J. Paul Reed: Good afternoon, Chicago.

00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,070
We are in that zone.

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,070
Well, hopefully we will wake up a little bit.

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,070
My name is Paul Reed, I work at Netflix.

00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,860
And... there it is.

00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:26,220
I spend most of my days thinking about incident management, analysis, retrospectives, post

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,760
mortems, who thinks about retros?

00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,410
We are going to think about it in a different context today.

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:41,890
So the story starts in Daly City, California, with one of the best In N Outs there because

00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:48,650
it is co-located with a Krispy Creme, one stop for fat and sugar.

00:00:48,650 --> 00:01:03,000
I went with a friend, and I made a left turn to get back on the highway on the other side

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,350
of the street.

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:13,350
This is the intersection I roll up to, a normal day, fat and happy on cheese burgers.

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:21,640
And as I made that turn, coming up behind me, which is certainly unexpected, is a police.

00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,000
This is the PD that pulled me over, I put him in the deck because he has the best name

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,890
ever, Officer Directo of the Daly City PD.

00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,010
He is not like, do you know what you did wrong?

00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,710
He said, did you see the sign?

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,790
What sign?

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,259
License and registration, please.

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,329
So he runs all of that funny information, and in the next 15 minutes, he comes back

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,520
with a ticket.

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,060
And I was like, what just happened?

00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,479
I was having burgers, and now I owe the county $238.

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,049
This is not a good afternoon.

00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,119
So we're going to go back to the intersection.

00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:19,280
I'm going to be quiet, do you see anything weird in that intersection?

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,230
So how many signs did I supposedly not obey?

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,970
There are two right-turn only signs that are supposedly in your field of vision, but I

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,919
was like, this seems weird to me.

00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,560
Why are there two signs, are they about the same intersection?

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,109
The signs have a different font, different dimensions, and they look different.

00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:45,139
That is kind of strange.

00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:51,610
And I had the question, well, what should a sign look like, a right-turn only sign look

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,630
like?

00:02:52,630 --> 00:03:01,000
I went down a rabbit hole, the manual of traffic signs and what they should look like and should

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,579
be placed, and 20 minutes later of my life that I will never get back, that sign has

00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:11,630
not been street legal for 15 years.

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:19,650
That is interesting, and that's the regulation -- R11 California, R is preceded by R053R.

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:27,750
The signs are weird, and then we will look at the right-turn only sign.

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,949
The markings on the ground, this is the Daly City DMV, that had you go that way.

00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:35,949
That is odd.

00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,910
And some people shouted out the tree.

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,870
The picture on the right, you will notice that the tree is obscuring more of the sign.

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:50,650
So who is responsible for making sure that we can see that tree, the city, someone else?

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,930
And the street markings are odd, you can see that where there was a right-turn arrow painted,

00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,660
and somebody was like, no, no, we are painting another arrow.

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,240
You will also notice there is no double yellow line.

00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,250
So it wouldn't occur to you to not turn left.

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,400
So there are three take-aways.

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,580
When I rolled up to that intersection, when the cop rolled up, we both had a view of what

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,669
the other person was thinking and neither was correct.

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:21,139
In an incident when that happens, the situation is not what it seems.

00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:26,930
When you are conducting an incident analysis, you want to do it as closely after the incident

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,930
as you possibly can.

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,790
If I had not returned later in the day to take the photos that I took, I probably wouldn't

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,320
have the data to show that something was wrong.

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,871
And finally, I love Dr. Decker's quote, if it made sense to one person, it will make

00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,680
sense to other people, too.

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,400
I watched a bunch of people turn left at that intersection when I was taking photos, so

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,280
I can go to traffic court.

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:57,110
So, of course, my case that day was the only case that the judge did not make a ruling

00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,110
on.

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,890
She said I will take it under advisement, she said, I don't know what that means.

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,890
That is bad.

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,840
But did they take the arguments?

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,130
Well, boom.

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,190
They did.

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,510
[ Applause ]. So, friends, practice those incident analysis

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,850
skills, you would be surprised where they come in handy.

00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm J. Paul Reed on Twitter, that's all I got.

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,320
