Description: 
	Karissa Peth - Document Like a Scientist

Learn how scientists document their work and are able to pick up new experimental protocols quickly. Apply the concepts of scientific protocols to your documentation to make them more useful to yourself and your users.

Working in the “S” part of STEM has taught me a lot of applicable practices to apply to tech. From thinking about distributed systems as cell signaling pathways to troubleshooting deployment problems on variable at a time to writing and expecting high fidelity documentation. Learning some of these thought patterns took years to develop, but implementing high fidelity documentation is possible by following a few best practices from science.

In this talk, I’ll discuss standard aspects of scientific documentation that allows scientists to pick up new experiment protocols with over 100 steps and execute them flawlessly. We’ll dive into the purpose of each piece of scientific documentation and how that translates to a better experience with technical documentation. These features don’t require writing more, but thinking about how the features of the documentation help not only the user but also the writer of the documentation.

Karissa Peth - Document Like a Scientist >>MATT STRATTON: Fantastic.

00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:15,269
Thank you, Baron!

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,269
All right.

00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:17,269
Before we get to our last talk of the morning, we have a fun game that we're all going to

00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:18,269
play together.

00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,269
The first thing we want to talk about, as we introduce the DevOpsDays, I want to talk

00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,269
about why you are seeing so many references to yaks, you see it in our logo, we have someone

00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:21,269
dressed as a yak, we have a yak, for crying out loud.

00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:22,269
How many of you are familiar with the term yak shaving?

00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:23,269
This was a term that was coined at MIT's AI lab, and it refers to an apparently useless

00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:24,269
activity that allows you to overcome intermediate difficulties, allowing you to solve a problem.

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,269
I was doing a little bit little bit of yak shaving, but it paid off, or it is consciously

00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:26,269
or unconsciously procrastinating doing something useful.

00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:27,269
And this is big in DevOps.

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,269
>>SASHA ROSENBAUM: And we can either learn from Jason's ignite on this includes miscellaneous

00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:29,269
additions to the agenda which were posted more than 72 hours in advance of the meeting

00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:30,269
as indicated on the supplemental agenda afternoon, or start an open space on this.

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,269
>>MATT STRATTON: Yes.

00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:32,269
And joining us on this is the DevOps yak.

00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:33,269
[Game].

00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:34,269
. >>MATT STRATTON: Sasha, would you like to

00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:35,269
introduce the final speaker of the morning?

00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,269
>>SASHA ROSENBAUM: Yes, I would like to introduce Karissa Peth !

00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,269
>>Karissa Peth: Hi, I'm a developer at Microsoft working in Azure.

00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:38,269
And I started in tech 4 and a half years ago, I caught myself to code in Python while I

00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:39,269
was commuting back and forth to my previous job by ferry in the San Francisco bay area.

00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:40,269
And there was one thing when I was teaching myself to code that I kept running into.

00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:44,680
And I still run into it now, four and a half years later.

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:54,110
And it's -- I miss scientific documentation, and what is going on that that's the feeling

00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,110
I keep having?

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,930
Three weeks ago, I was teaching myself something new, and the same feeling popped up all this

00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,949
time later.

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,909
So the part I haven't mentioned is what my previous career is, by the title of the talk,

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,140
you are probably guessing something in science.

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,060
I was a cancer researcher.

00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,700
I was trying to cure cancer.

00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,100
And we don't talk about it that way when we are doing cancer research, but that's what

00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,670
I was doing, and I did that for about nine years.

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,799
And no, it wasn't data science, it was in the lab with the lab coat and goggles and

00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:35,210
gloves and pipettes and all the crazy stuff that goes along with it.

00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,149
And if you are wondering what the picture is, it is a pretty cool picture.

00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:42,450
Those are immune cells attacking cancer cells.

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,069
And that's close to what I was working on right before I left.

00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:53,159
But cancer research, that is cool, it doesn't really look like that, day-to-day, it looks

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,399
more like this: Scatter plots of cells.

00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:06,479
Each one of the dots is a cell, analyzing them, and taking a subset of the cells and

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,090
analyzing them further.

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,810
This is what cancer research looks like day-to-day.

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,319
So why would I expect cancer research to be similar to tech?

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:26,600
That is far apart, they are both part of stem, but not the same, right?

00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,390
Surprisingly, though, my transfer into tech has felt pretty natural.

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,200
We both do sprint planning.

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,780
The one on the left is literally an example of a sprint plan I did.

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,110
We didn't call it sprint planning, but weekly naming sessions.

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:50,570
And on the right, a weekly documentation plan from the sprint planning.

00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,970
We both do sprint planning.

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,600
We both do white boarding.

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,100
I was shocked, when I put these together, how similar they looked.

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,760
One of these is a photo from my phone.

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,460
Can you tell what that is?

00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,400
The one on the right is mine.

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,360
That is cancer research.

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,710
On the left, that whiteboarding image is from a Stack Overflow blog post.

00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,980
Yeah.

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,810
And also, this.

00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,370
We both work on really complicated systems.

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,900
And we both look into those systems when something goes wrong.

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,450
Canter is the system going wrong.

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,040
So that's all the same, why?

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,420
What is it that is making me feel this way?

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,400
That's the same, we are logical, stem, what is making me feel like I am missing scientific

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,040
documentation so much?

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,660
I will dive into what it look like.

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,300
Do you remember the scientific method, science, chemistry?

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:07,410
It is used across all of science.

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,030
I think the best way is to look specifically at the project I was working on right before

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,600
I left.

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,019
And you have this again, this is bigger, I know.

00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:28,530
This is showing cancer signalling as it invades a cell and the immune system.

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:37,970
That's a lot going on, I worked on the stuff in the bottom, the left gray square, some

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:44,460
of the work that I published is now being used in people to treat their cancer.

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,689
And with all the stuff that we know, and we will take a moment, legacy systems, everyone?

00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,689
Legacy systems.

00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:55,169
There is stuff we don't know.

00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:00,949
There is still questions, and that's what I was looking for.

00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:08,199
So, in cancer research, I was looking for an unknown receptor that binds to a known

00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,580
protein that is upregulated in cancer research.

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,530
I was looking for these question marks.

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:20,830
When I started this project, I had to go and learn about everything that was out there,

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:27,749
execute the plan flawlessly, analyze the output, and keep moving.

00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:29,129
That's the process.

00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:34,529
And I know some of you might be feeling this way, having bad flashbacks, to bio class,

00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:38,500
biology, high school college, I'm not sure.

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:47,479
I promise you don't need to know any more biology to implement better scientific documentation.

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:52,660
The reality is, some of the process that I just talked about that I would use to do the

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,599
research, it sounds similar to you all, too.

00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:00,009
This is another thing that is similar.

00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:09,060
You have a problem statement and break that into smaller steps that are easier to carry

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,060
out.

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,289
You go looking for tools, for a process that you think might be the right way.

00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,551
And then you actually execute that process.

00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:21,550
And then you confirm that the output is what you expected, and you go to the next step

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,719
or a whole new problem statement.

00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:28,370
So this is similar, the bioscience.

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,779
My receptor is determined from the protein.

00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:38,259
That is like staying in an Airbnb competitor, I will just go and build it.

00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,650
How are you going to build it?

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,620
These are general ideas of how I would go about researching for this receptor.

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,819
And the first one is, I'm going to determine if this protein binds to certain cell types

00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,629
more than others.

00:06:52,629 --> 00:07:01,360
We know that this protein is related to cancer immunology, so we will start with those types

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,889
of cells.

00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,270
And the next step, I will start searching.

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,599
We go to Google, start searching, this feels normal.

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,650
We do that, too.

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:19,460
There are whole analogous to Stack Overflow, there is something -- two sites out there

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,629
that are used for research a lot of times.

00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:25,500
The reality is, this is where things are different.

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,409
In science, we do more of this.

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,470
And you might be, like, what's the data, a data what?

00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,039
You are thinking, she is from Microsoft, you are thinking this?

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,009
It is not Excel, or a spreadsheet.

00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:44,289
I know you are thinking data, I showed you scatterplot -- nope.

00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:49,869
It is not prettier either.

00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:54,861
Yeah, that's what a datasheet looks like, mechanical and electrical engineering was

00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:56,639
here earlier.

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:05,610
This might feel familiar to people like that, there is a database for chips and stuff, too.

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:13,629
This is a protocol for how to separate immune cells from human blood.

00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,550
And we're going to look at this a little bit further.

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,509
But the key thing to keep in mind is a data sheet in bioscience is your vendor docs.

00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:30,399
And in reality, there's two types of documentation that can happen in bioscience.

00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,460
Your vendor docs are a data sheet, and your lab notebook.

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,140
I cannot show you my notebook, that's a bunch of proprietary information, so I'm showing

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,850
you vendor docs, but this is what I would do when I write a protocol and put it in my

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,320
laboratory notebook as well.

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:57,220
So it applies, lab notebooks, documentation, your run books, code, incident plan, and vendor

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,210
docs is what you try to do, go and use someone's service.

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:09,120
So back to our experiment, we need to isolate immune cells from human blood.

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,990
This is what the directions look like from the data sheet.

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,490
That's a lot, if I get rid of the notes, that's what it looks like.

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,890
We're going to add something to a tube, delete a sample, put the sample in the tube, spin

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,960
it, centrifuging, pour something off and wash.

00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Seems pretty simple.

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,460
What if I added this?

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,380
There's an image, now I know what the tube looks like.

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:44,410
How many of you came here today and thought you would get immune cells out of human blood?

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,590
How many of you thought, with these instructions, you can probably do this?

00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,510
Yeah, see?

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,110
This is what I'm getting at.

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,650
Great documentation gets you out of the how and into the why.

00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,540
Do you remember why we're doing this?

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,900
We're looking for a new cancer treatment.

00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,940
That is important, that's a big problem that I want to solve!

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,870
I don't have to think about how do I actually have to do each one of the steps when we have

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,870
good documentation?

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,030
I can focus on the big problem we are trying to solve.

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,660
All of you are using it to solve an unsolved problem, otherwise you are not looking at

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,710
it.

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,280
What makes documentation work?

00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:42,870
I'm throwing in cool science images and the blue line is 

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,870
the nucleus.

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:50,800
And you might have seen this in some documentation, but it is not widespread yet.

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,650
But what does that look like?

00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:58,020
This is in science documentation, this is very specific.

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,850
It has an actual part number in there.

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,681
It gives you a note, actually, about that part number, all of it.

00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,020
It is very specific.

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,840
Maybe this doesn't work in tech, but how about this?

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,660
This is from the home project.

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:22,480
You are told to have a Kubernetes cluster, this manages Kubernetes clusters and packages

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
for it.

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,610
And these are things that you have decided or thought about.

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:34,260
The materials list, that is like homework.

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,300
Nobody likes it, and it helps you learn and your users be successful and getting through

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,910
the rest of the documentation.

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,250
If you tell them what they need to get, they are more likely to get through it.

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:52,530
If you are trying to cook through something, you don't want to get halfway through and

00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,510
say, darn, I didn't know I needed garlic.

00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,050
I didn't say it at the top.

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:06,080
Don't tell them they need a log in, or acsss they don't have, or an account they haven't

00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,560
signed up for.

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,570
Make sure that they know what to do to be successful.

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:16,820
Diagrams and pictures are worth a thousand words.

00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,810
It doesn't have to be fancy.

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,740
It can be something like this.

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:40,840
It has a few lines and the process it takes, I have a few notes, and compiling stuff is

00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
bad, but that's long.

00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,880
And this looks like this, the HashiCorps terra form documentation.

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:54,670
That is great, it tells me how long, the process, and adding the diagram doesn't take a lot

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,760
of effort.

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,910
This might surprise you, and low-vision type of things, but it increases the accessibility

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,410
of the documentation.

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:10,630
There's a lot of us that are visual learners, myself included, there are people with dyslexia,

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,380
or reading is not their favorite thing to do.

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:21,420
And one thing that people do not think about is the diagram can help people, when the language

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,070
that your docs are written in is not their first language, or they are translating it.

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,590
If you give them a diagram, they are more likely to have an idea to piece it together

00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:37,900
with the bad Google translate that came through.

00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,240
This sounds really basic, but every time I talk to somebody about dates on docs, it is

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,590
the most controversial thing in tech.

00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:52,130
People are like, no, then people will know my docs are old.

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:57,370
Yeah, that's the point.

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,420
It is not bad, a book is not less valuable.

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,970
We still read stories from way back in the day.

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:11,660
It doesn't make necessarily unuseful if it is older, it gives me some context.

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:20,630
This isn't in every bioscience that we look at, my lab has dates on every single page.

00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:26,560
So let's add dates to this, this is not granular dates, this is 2017.

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,240
But having that information, I know this is a newer protocol than when I left.

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,240
So I need to go back and really re-read this to make sure something hasn't changed.

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:44,850
So I know it is newer, or older, and I will know that these things worked, maybe some

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,930
things have changed since then, but it still worked.

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,120
This is hard to find an example from tech.

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:59,070
I cannot tell you -- some people are like, wait, my docs are on GitHub so it is fine.

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,760
Sure, just put it in the top.

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,150
Don't make your users go digging to see when the last commit was and when you added a comma

00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,150
somewhere.

00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,730
That doesn't tell me whether the docs are new or old.

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,820
Put documentation somewhere.

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:20,510
And it tells users if they can rely on it or not.

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:28,080
If you go somewhere and there's a screenshot, and the button is not there, maybe it is moved.

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,310
If I know the documentation is old, it is easy for me to be like, yeah, they probably

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,310
just changed the UI.

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,230
If I don't have a date, I might think that I have gotten somewhere I shouldn't, or did

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,610
something wrong, or there was a problem in what I was doing.

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:50,720
You can add dates, you have this metadata, and these are the easiest things you can add

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,250
to the documentation.

00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:02,580
Positive controls, you may know what negative controls are, from chem or bio.

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,220
Negative controls is when you don't expect an outcome.

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:13,300
A positive control is confirming you have done something right, so you have a positive

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:22,040
outcome, it is planned and you know about it ahead of time -- and in tech, you have

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,790
confirmations all the time.

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:30,120
The user database has a confirmation, but I'm not being shown this is correct.

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:44,180
So this is a positive control for a cell experiment, and if I don't get a clump

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,870
like here, I did something wrong.

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,220
If I get something like that, then I did something right.

00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:01,130
In tech, this is taken from a tutorial on how to build a static website.

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,970
And it shows you exactly what you are supposed to see as soon as you open up the browser,

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,529
if you get to this point.

00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:11,120
A lot of people have a lot of screenshots in their documentation.

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,470
That's fine, don't remove those.

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,790
But a lot of those screenshots don't tell you what you are going to see after you click

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,790
the button that you drew the red box around, it shows me that I'm supposed to click the

00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,610
red button.

00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,480
So tell people, if it is confirmation message, if it is a response code, tell people if there

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,160
is something from the command line that should have an output, give people that idea that

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,540
they can see what they are supposed to have.

00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,679
It is like a map, and it tells you that you are heading in the right direction.

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,390
You come out of a subway station, and you are like, I don't know if 42nd street is this

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,390
way or this way.

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:50,860
And you look at the street signs, and you are like, I don't know if they are walking

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,820
the right way.

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,350
Positive control signs are street signs for the users.

00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,250
Don't make it hard to tell, did I do it right?

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,250
I'm not sure.

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,240
And these are positive check points, if I did something wrong this time, you will not

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,210
go all the way back to the beginning.

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:13,690
You will go back to the last check point, somewhere between that positive control and

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,580
this I messed something up.

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,540
That helps with the problem solving.

00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:38,540
Rationale: So this seems very basic, but put rationale in your documentation, and why you

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,170
would use this one piece or this one feature.

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:51,480
That is not too hard, how do I do this call, and do I want to use this API for this?

00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,520
I'm not sure.

00:18:52,520 --> 00:19:03,510
And in bio science, we have long introductory paragraphs, I took a couple pieces here so

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,050
you can read it, what it looks like.

00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:12,691
So it is telling me about the biology, that there's not very many immune cells of the

00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:15,130
type that I'm looking for in human blood.

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,720
So that's a low number.

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:26,100
And in the bottom, the blue, detection and characterization, a rare, AG-specific T cells.

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:33,830
So we can analyze and work on these cells and their T cells.

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,540
It is telling me that's what I can do with it.

00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:43,240
So some rationale, why I want to use this, if I don't want to work on T cells, I probably

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,360
don't want to use this protocol.

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,100
This is what it looks like in tech.

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:59,120
This is from Honeycomb's documentation, on using or should not use heatmaps.

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,540
Don't use it if you get complete noise, but when you see a larger spread of values.

00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,770
That is helpful.

00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:14,480
I know when I should use something, and when I shouldn't use something.

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,800
That's a lasting impact of your documentation, when you add the rationale and use up front.

00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,170
People do it not remember to click the button, you can get back to the docs to do that.

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:31,380
They need to know why to use a service or a feature in the first place, or why they

00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,690
shouldn't -- nope, I wasn't supposed to use this, it is not the right thing, that rationale

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,260
is what people remember.

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,150
That's the learning, is the why.

00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,960
The how doesn't matter as much.

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,110
So that's why I missed scientific documentation.

00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:56,270
And the thing to note here is that I showed you examples from tech documentation.

00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,750
You have it, in each one of the docs you have it.

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,890
And the bioscience clips are from a protocol or document.

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:16,640
I have not come out at a single document in tech 

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,130
that has all five of those in a single place, if you have, tell me.

00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:27,880
It only has maybe one, the date, the job, the positive controls, that is very rare.

00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,020
Good job if you do.

00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:35,150
And nobody has put all of these things together, even to me, this is just standard!

00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,220
This is just everything, even my lab notebook had all five of these things for every single

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:48,660
experiment that I ran.

00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:55,429
So let's shift from focusing on the how we do things to what problem that we're solving,

00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:59,679
let's get our documentation to the point that people can really focus on that problem that

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,380
they're working on.

00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,590
Don't make it that difficult for your users, and apply it to the stuff that you apply internally.

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,230
Those five things make a big difference, but you need them all together.

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,470
One of those is not going to make great documentation.

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,940
You need everything to come together, but as you saw, they are not that hard to implement.

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,920
They are pretty small, it is not more docs, but a few little bits that are missing, a

00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,640
couple holes.

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:34,350
So I hope that this science did not bore you too much.

00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:42,600
One more scientific photo for you all, a 3D cell culture with S RNA in there, our tech

00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,180
slides are way cooler than bio slides.

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:58,559
We do not have gifs -- and what scientists do that is cool in their presentations is

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:06,279
we always had an acknowledgement slide, which is for anybody that helped you do your research,

00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,850
or supported the researcher.

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,270
So I just thought I would add that as well.

00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,213
Major shout-out to these people who helped me.

00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:13,213
