Description: 
	Joshua Zimmerman - Ignite: The Princess Bride and Devops

“Are you kidding? It’s got fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles.” This describes not only devops, but the greatest movie of all time, The Princess Bride. With those similarities, perhaps there are lessons that we can learn from this great movie.

Devops is the greatest thing in the world, except for a nice MLT - mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich where the mutton is nice and lean. However, we can still learn from things outside of devops. Need to see how people with cross-functional skills can overcome challenges they couldn’t alone? Look no farther than Westley, Inigo and Fezzik storming Florin castle. This talk will use scenes, quotes and references from The Princess Bride to teach everyone things about devops.

Joshua Zimmerman -- 10 things The Princess Bride teaches us about DevOps

00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,340
>>Joshua Zimmerman: DevOps.

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,390
DevOps is what brings us together.

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:29,969
DevOps, that blessed arrangement, that dream within a dream [pope voice from the princess

00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:30,969
voice].

00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:43,610
DevOps is great, except for an MLT, where the mutton is lean and the tomato is ripe.

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,920
If you have not seen The Princess Bride, you have homework now, and I promise it is more

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,059
fun than Aaron's.

00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:58,109
This teaches you the most essential of the DevOps lessons, that we need to work with

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,199
people at different skill sets and backgrounds to achieve goals.

00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:14,410
At the movie's climax, we need brains, brawn, and sword skills for storming the castle.

00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:19,790
And they can meet all of the separate goals by collaborating and working together.

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,930
And we also learn that people are not always enough.

00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,940
We do often need tools and technologies to assist us.

00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,540
But it is just like them, it is important to know precisely what you need.

00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,210
Wesley does not bemoan having a Kubernetes, I mean, a catapult to storm the castle?

00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:45,570
They want a cloak and a wheel barrow, so instead of attacking, they can scare the guards away

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,200
and sneak in.

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,630
We can learn from their mistakes.

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:58,420
After using for strength, wesley and indigo ditch him to accomplish their goals separately.

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,270
However, they forget to plan their mistake.

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:11,480
And the man with strength handles it for him, and he finds four white horses, doing what

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,459
everyone underestimates him for, his brain.

00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:21,780
When you underestimate your colleagues, they do not pick up the slack where you need them

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,370
to pick up something.

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,670
Our organizations pay us to solve difficult problems, for that reason.

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:37,470
No vendor, no tool, is go to take away the tool or the challenges from running your applications

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,470
at scale.

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,390
That is just how it works.

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,230
Indigo lives his life, reacting to the instant of his father murdered.

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,020
When he meets them, he asked if they have six fingers on their right hand, asking systems

00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:59,480
questions to determine what the steps he need to take, observability, and this teaches us

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:06,100
in many occasions, this is a different set of questions than if you want to know if a

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:12,720
glass has poison in it and you will die if you drink it.

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,380
Systems can lie to us, Indigo says, I fell over and I'm fine, but he doesn't look so

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,650
good.

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,569
Our systems lie to us.

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:31,350
When Indigo and Wesley meet, they talk before Indigo tells him he has to kill him.

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:40,390
It is like having cattle instead of pets for servers.

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,420
To do our jobs well, we need to discard the work that ourselves and our colleagues have

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,450
done previously, we need to respect it, as Indigo and respect each other, but you cannot

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,730
claim to it.

00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,010
You should not kill someone with our skills, please don't.

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,750
And the movie shows us to be ethical, too.

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:12,340
The strong man and Indigo says what they are doing with Fisiney is wrong 

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:20,030
and they go against him, they are rescuing someone, stopping a war.

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,180
And Indigo gets a cushy gig as a pirate captain.

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,750
Don't do something unethical because someone is paying you.

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:35,949
Indigo is telling Fisiney that he is going to dual left-handed, his off hand, and Fisiney

00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,240
decides to wrestle him.

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,280
If you don't give people structure of how they express their skills, they will do it

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:52,320
how they want to, which is a good way to figure out tools you want yoloed into production.

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,200
Give people structure before they flex skills.

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:04,480
And Visiney treats of great blunders, your organization will not succeed in a land war

00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
in Asia.

00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,699
But he teaches that only slightly less well known is go against a Sicilian when death

00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,590
is on the line!

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:28,756
[Laughing maniacally, similar to the bald guy on The Princess Bride].

00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:29,756
>>MATT STRATTON: Thank you to all of our ignite speakers, and now it is time for open spaces

00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:30,756
again!

00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:30,770
