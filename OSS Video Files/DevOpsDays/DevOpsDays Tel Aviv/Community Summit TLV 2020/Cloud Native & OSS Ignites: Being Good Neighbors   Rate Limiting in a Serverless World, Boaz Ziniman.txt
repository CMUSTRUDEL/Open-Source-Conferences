Description: 
	How do you avoid DDoSing other systems or running out of resources when developing serverless applications? Serverless cloud based applications bring new challenges with their architecture and scaling capabilities. In a perfect world, this should be an advantage only, but we all know by now, that the world ainâ€™t perfect.

This session will focus on why rate limiting is so important in serverless systems and how you should design a better system that acts as a better neighbors.
