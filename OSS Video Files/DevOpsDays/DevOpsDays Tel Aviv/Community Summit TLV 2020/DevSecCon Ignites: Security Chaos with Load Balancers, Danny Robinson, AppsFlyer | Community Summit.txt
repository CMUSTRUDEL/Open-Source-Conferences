Title: DevSecCon Ignites: Security Chaos with Load Balancers, Danny Robinson, AppsFlyer | Community Summit
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Whilst testing a directory traversal vulnerability within one of our services, I found that I got different behaviour when testing through a load balancer and direct to the service. This talk is about the research the that followed. Key Findings Discussed: AWS Application Load Balancers share code with NGINX, NGINX parses http urls in a special way which results in a protective behaviour for directory traversal attacks, How I bypassed this protection behaviour, and Quick lessons from the research
