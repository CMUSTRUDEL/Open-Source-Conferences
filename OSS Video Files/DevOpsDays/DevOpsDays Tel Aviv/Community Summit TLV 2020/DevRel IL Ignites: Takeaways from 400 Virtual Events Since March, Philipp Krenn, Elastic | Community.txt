Description: 
	Virtual talks are the new norm. In theory, they are great — speakers and attendees can join from around the world, infrastructure is cheap and scalable, recordings are simple. But what is happening in reality with problems like Zoom fatigue? What is and what isn’t working? At Elastic, we have done 400 virtual talks and meetups since March. This talk gives an overview of the development over time, specifics in regions, differences in tooling,… and adds some personal anecdotes.
