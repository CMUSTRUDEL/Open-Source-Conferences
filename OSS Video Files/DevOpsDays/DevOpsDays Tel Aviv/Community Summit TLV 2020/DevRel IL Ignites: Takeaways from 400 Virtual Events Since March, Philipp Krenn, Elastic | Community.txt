Title: DevRel IL Ignites: Takeaways from 400 Virtual Events Since March, Philipp Krenn, Elastic | Community
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Virtual talks are the new norm. In theory, they are great — speakers and attendees can join from around the world, infrastructure is cheap and scalable, recordings are simple. But what is happening in reality with problems like Zoom fatigue? What is and what isn’t working? At Elastic, we have done 400 virtual talks and meetups since March. This talk gives an overview of the development over time, specifics in regions, differences in tooling,… and adds some personal anecdotes.

[Music]

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,760
and from there we're going straight

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
to our next speaker philip crane from

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,679
elastic

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,960
hello philip hi how's it going

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,280
good how are you where are you joining

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,200
us from uh well i'm at home in vienna

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,399
for a change unfortunately not i'm not

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
in israel this year

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,680
because december is always very nice in

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,559
terms of weather because

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,879
austria is pretty crappy right now yeah

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,520
yeah

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,640
definitely uh uh less less favorable in

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
terms of weather-wise

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,520
and you're going to talk to us about

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,520
something very near and dear to my heart

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
being a developer advocate as well at

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,960
logs io then

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,000
you know the the virtual situation in

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
which we were all thrown

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,920
into due to the coffee 19 situation and

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,080
you're going to share with us about the

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,439
takeaways from 400 virtual

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,000
talks since march so i'll share your

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,680
uh screen and the floor in yours

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
let's see what we can do here so yeah

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,040
thanks for the introduction i wanted to

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,880
show you what we are actually up to so

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,320
i'm i'm a developer advocate uh

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,840
in elastic i lead the european developer

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,240
advocacy team now um globally we are

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,799
like

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,880
20 people on the team so that's how we

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,479
got to 400 talks it's not just me doing

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,360
400 talks since march but

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,840
all of us plus the community so we kind

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,720
of like

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,400
tracked a lot of things being part of a

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,159
larger organization the problem is of

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,000
course people will come to you and ask

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
what are you even doing and why are you

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,479
doing this and why are we paying you

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,000
um to do all of that stuff so that's why

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,079
we got a bit better at

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,439
tracking of what we're doing why we're

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,000
doing it how we're doing it what is

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,640
working what

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,119
is not working i wanted to share some of

00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,840
that

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,799
so that the first thing that we always

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,560
need to tell

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,320
internally and it probably makes sense

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,640
to establish that at other companies as

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,080
well

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,440
is that advocacy is about reach

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
and not leads or revenue if you're about

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,840
leads

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
um then you're actually a marketing

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,800
organization you're just calling

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
yourself community if you're about

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,239
revenue you're a sales organization um

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,160
and you're also just calling yourself

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,959
community so we are really about the

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,520
reach and our goal is to touch as many

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,040
people

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,760
using or being interested in our

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,879
software as possible

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,160
coming corona um everything changed

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,879
before we were doing a lot of

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,720
in-person events nowadays elastic's

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,680
policy is pretty strict there is no

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,239
travel at all anywhere and no in-person

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,599
events

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,280
at all so it has to be virtual so

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,280
what we're doing is we're of course

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,879
organizing our own meetups

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,319
there it's a bit easier to see what is

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,000
working and what is not working because

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,319
it's more under our control

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,599
but of course we are also attending

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,000
external meetups

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,519
doing conference talks like this one uh

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,159
lunch and learn sessions we are

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,120
doing like student sessions sometimes

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,120
workshops

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
and all of those we try to match

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
together in some statistics which

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,159
might look something like this obviously

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,920
we're tracking everything

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,599
in kibana but that will not surprise

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,360
anybody so you can see i

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,440
i'm almost lying in my title because

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,080
we're getting close to 500 events now

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,360
and this is since the 1st of march what

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,599
we have been trekking

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
and you see like a bit of a seasonality

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,560
in in spring and then like in fall where

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,879
stuff

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
spikes and summer being lighter but we

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,319
actually kept the good

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,879
cadence of events throughout the years

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,920
in terms of attendees you can see um

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,440
there was this initial curiosity bubble

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,519
basically when people wanted to do

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,599
virtual events and everybody joined

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
um especially over summer everything

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,640
died down and even though we did a lot

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
of events we didn't get that many

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,400
attendees

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
and now in fall stuff started to climb

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,959
up but we also see

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,840
a certain amount of zoom fatigue and you

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
can see

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,480
blue is for example conferences and

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,760
green would be like internal conferences

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,280
that we have been organized

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,959
sorry internal meetups that we have been

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,080
organizing um

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,560
so yeah we reached almost 40 000 people

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,439
since

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
march with our events um roughly 100

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,199
people per

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,280
per session or so um for most of those

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,479
or for half or so of those we also have

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,280
youtube videos

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,400
um and those we are tracking as well in

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,280
terms of

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,800
region like we are broken up into apj

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,919
europe middle east

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,520
africa and north and south america

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,320
at first when you look at those numbers

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,400
it looks very sad because it looks like

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,000
the americas are doing much better than

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
everybody else in terms of average

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,160
attendee per event

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,080
but for us i'm not sure if that is a

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,639
general trend but at least for us

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,919
um brazil is working amazingly well in

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,320
terms of virtual events

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,199
so if i exclude brazil from that list

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,120
suddenly

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,320
no the americas are only like in the

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,560
middle and then it's much

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,600
closer between the the three regions

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,320
than it was before

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,639
so for us brazil is really an outlier

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,360
and

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,639
we're not really sure yet why we have a

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,240
good advocate there but we have good

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,400
advocates in other regions as well

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,160
um we'll need to try to see how we can

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,440
replicate that to other regions or if

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,479
that is really just

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,440
specific to brazil um we do use the

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,960
usual tools

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,280
um often zoom youtube live streaming

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,160
um the the meter platform that we use is

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,320
baby

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,479
the nice thing about youtube is that we

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,360
once we have the link we just tracked

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,759
the views over time and you can see how

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
many

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,199
youtube views we get on our videos so

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,080
that's also another

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,000
easy thing to track and then post we're

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,919
also trying to track um

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,280
like per event type the average

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,039
attendance but that is very

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,960
jumpy over time so that doesn't show you

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,120
much um

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,800
who is doing what that is especially

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,520
within an organization of an interesting

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,759
question

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,880
um so we are kind of like trying to keep

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,800
track like

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,880
who is hosting our events who is

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,680
presenting and what are the the top

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,600
topics that we do so this is just like

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,440
the usual tag cloud so we throw in all

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
the titles that we do and this is what

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,720
pops up

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,479
to see what are we actually doing and

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
what might be working or what might not

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,680
be working

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,639
um what is great about the virtual

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,600
events

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,080
they just scale i can do three events

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,319
today

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,000
in three different regions um and the

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,759
cost is very low because well

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
as long as my internet is up everything

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,720
works the downside is

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,960
and i want to have like some interaction

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,039
on chat afterwards but in reality

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,800
interaction and feedback is definitely

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,560
more limited with all those virtual

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
events and there is no good way around

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,840
it especially

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,520
sponsoring for us does not really work

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,240
that well anywhere

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,800
one funny side note sponsoring cost we

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,080
saw go

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,800
down in europe uh and

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,319
the americas probably because venues and

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,599
food are expensive and you don't need

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,720
them anymore whereas in

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,400
apj we saw sponsoring costs go up and we

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,160
don't really know why but our guess

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,319
is that like international platforms

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,039
like hop in and so that many conferences

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,560
use

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,400
they are priced in dollars and they're

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,639
the same everywhere so

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,240
before events in apj were often

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,080
relatively cheap run with the

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,440
international platforms like the costs

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,000
even out everywhere

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,919
so it's the same amount to run an event

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,919
in emyana or in nasa

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,840
as it is in apj which is kind of an

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,639
unexpected development for us

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,720
um and of course the steps for this talk

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,800
will go right into this dashboard

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,280
afterwards so if i give this talk again

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,319
it will be part of that data collection

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,319
thanks a lot

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,440
if you have any questions like we have a

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,039
lot more of those

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,120
little dashboards and screenshots in

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,680
there um if you want to know more

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,039
ping me on chat and i'm happy to dive

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,160
further into it with you

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,639
thanks a lot thank you very much philip

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,319
and that's

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,680
definitely a challenge for all of all of

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,120
our industry i guess

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,720
the question that popped into mind you

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,520
you touched it at the very last slide

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,840
saying that

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,680
uh uh the downside is or one of them

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,240
that is more more significant to me is

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,479
that

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,240
the the direct interaction that used to

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,759
happen and the physical events in

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,960
between the talks you know when you

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,919
got to the the the way to chat to uh get

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,680
the feeling and

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,440
feel the pulse with the developers not

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,560
just relaying you know outbound

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,960
communication but also

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,400
get the feedback in um and that's i

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,080
guess the big challenge for all of us

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,639
do you have any tips on that or are you

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,080
still struggling with that yourselves

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,680
i have the feeling there is no good

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,280
replacement and we're very much looking

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,280
forward to in-person events because

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,280
there is just no replacement over having

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,039
lunch together or a coffee and then just

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,839
having a discussion is just much more

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,919
natural

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,200
and also most people are just very tired

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,360
of any chat

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
and any other zoom call and whatever so

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,880
if i say like hey i'm here i'm a sponsor

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,839
just talk to me everybody's like

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,680
not another zoom call so i i'm afraid

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,560
it's just not working out that well for

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,160
for some stuff yeah so i agree with you

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,920
anyway i'm looking forward to having the

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,320
physical events again and also hosting

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,399
you

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,839
in israel thank you very much phillip

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:04,800
thank you i just wanted to join to say

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,800
