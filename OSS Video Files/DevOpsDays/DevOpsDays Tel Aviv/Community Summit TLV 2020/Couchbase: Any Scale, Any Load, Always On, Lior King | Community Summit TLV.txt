session

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,720
couch base any scale any load always on

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,840
my name is leo king and i'm a senior

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,759
solutions engineer

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,000
at couchbase couchbase was selected as

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,880
one of the leaders of the nosql database

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
market

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,439
above much bigger competitors such as

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,000
google and aws

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,200
countries can be found in a wide variety

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,320
of verticals

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,360
in e-commerce travel gaming

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,159
financial services and many more our

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,360
customers

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,399
span from fortune 500 companies to

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,480
small startups cadres is a perfect

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,319
choice for modern data platforms

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,800
it is based on an award-winning flexible

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,920
document-based database and countries

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
can scale out

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
to as many services necessary that

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,879
enables calculus to serve

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,879
millions of requests per second cache

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,360
base has one of the fastest caching

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,599
engines

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,080
in the market capable of performing

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,840
operations within microseconds

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,319
and couchbase is an ideal uh

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,720
platform for agile development and

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,440
continuous deployment

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,680
being a document based data platform

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,319
cardbase offers a flexible schema

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,080
for an agile development and your

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,000
deployment of your system

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,720
cadres has an internal caching engine

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,599
that produces incredible performance

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,319
it offers linear scalability and data

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:07,760
rebalancing within a click of a button

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:11,040
and it is always on with 99.999

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,480
availability but couchbase is also

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,560
uh the only non-relational platform

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,000
that offers comprehensive support for

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,640
the sql language

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
just like a relational database and it

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,680
offers

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,239
all the known capabilities of sql

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,799
including

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,840
all kinds of joins sub queries

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,239
aggregations

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,360
common table expressions you name it

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,400
whatever you know

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,599
about sql we have it in our language

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,120
on a non-relational platform uh

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,280
with couchbase you can perform

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,560
multi-document transactions

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,519
also known as asset transactions catrice

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,480
has an advanced

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,840
scalable search engine uh if you're

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,480
familiar with elasticsearch

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,280
we have capabilities that are similar to

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,519
it

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,519
it can perform any kind of analytical

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,319
query and you can easily connect

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,760
couchbase to bi tools such as tableau

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,319
power bi and others countries offers an

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,480
advanced data stream processing engine

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,840
and it offers an active active

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,319
replication

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,879
between remote clusters and that enables

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,920
you to

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,759
change the same data in both clusters at

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,959
the same time and countries can

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,280
perform conflict resolution if necessary

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,440
cadres also offers a mobile solution

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,400
with a small footprint database that can

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,639
be installed

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,000
as a part of your application on your

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,120
mobile device running a

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,040
ios or android and

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
it can automatically synchronize the

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,160
data between the mob device

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,960
and the central cluster and

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,240
cache base can manage itself

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,840
autonomously

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,280
on kubernetes so catrice offers various

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,080
services

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,800
and they can be activated on dedicated

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,240
nodes if you

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,240
if you want that way you can execute

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,320
thousands of queries and at the same

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,360
times perform millions and millions of

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,039
operations

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,600
uh data changes uh that is because

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,160
the services are not competing with each

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
other

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,800
over resources such as cpu memory and

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,800
disk

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,759
the data changes and the queries are

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,680
simply executed on different nodes

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,520
every service of cache base can be

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,840
scaled individually

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,639
allowing you to utilize your hardware

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,000
much better

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,199
and get true linear scalability we call

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,360
this capability

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,360
multi-dimensional scaling and couchbase

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,039
is the only product in the market

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,800
that offers this capability couchbase is

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,120
the first commercial database

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,080
company that have released an operator

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,400
for kubernetes two and a half years ago

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,440
the cajbus autonomous operator for

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,039
kubernetes

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
automates most of the database

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,320
administration tasks for you

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,440
the installation the upgrade automatic

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,400
recovery automatic backups replication

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,560
setup

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,840
and many many other tasks but the

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,639
coolest feature

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,440
is the automatic scaling of the services

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,600
of cadbus

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,280
that's right auto scaling you can

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,680
configure the conditions

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,319
of scaling your cl your cluster up or

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,880
down

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,240
and the operator will automatically

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,120
scale your cluster

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,080
when these conditions are met so of

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,319
course

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,080
five minutes cannot really cover a wide

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,400
solution such as couch base

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,280
so you are more than welcome to reach

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,639
out to me

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:34,520
