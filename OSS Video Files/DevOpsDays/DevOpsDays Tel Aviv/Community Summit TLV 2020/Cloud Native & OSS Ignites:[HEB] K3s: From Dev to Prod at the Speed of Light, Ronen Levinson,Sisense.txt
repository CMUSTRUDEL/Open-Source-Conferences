Description: 
	This talk was given in Hebrew.

With Kubernetes becoming the standard container orchestration tool, we got to a point in which apps are deployed and managed in the same ecosystem for different purposes. As a result, the number of Kubernetes distributions started to rise in order to deal with different scenarios. To name a few: OpenShift, RKE, Tanzuâ€¦ K3s is one of the newest distributions made by Rancher, which is an open source project that recently joined the list of CNCF Sandbox projects. The main goal of K3s is providing a lightweight k8s distribution using a single binary, while reducing the memory consumed by the orchestration tool.In this lightning talk we will discuss what k3s is, compare it to k8s and see how it can be installed for different purposes: CI, Edge, development and production.
