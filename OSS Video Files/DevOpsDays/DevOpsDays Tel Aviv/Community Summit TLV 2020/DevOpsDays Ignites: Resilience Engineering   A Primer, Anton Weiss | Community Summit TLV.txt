Title: DevOpsDays Ignites: Resilience Engineering   A Primer, Anton Weiss | Community Summit TLV
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Lately we've heard some buzz around the term "resilience engineering" in relation to information systems. Much of it initiated by none other but John Allspaw - the man who inspired the birth of DevOps. My talk will lay out how the ideas of resilience engineering relate to our daily work.

[Music]

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,240
one time here

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,760
next coming up is anton weiss

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,680
hey anton hey how are you

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,039
i'm doing pretty well pretty well so the

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,480
floor is yours you have

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,160
five minutes wonderful

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,520
well uh 31 years ago my life

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,120
crashed into iraq

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,200
a soviet-born teenager brought up in the

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,680
beautiful city of leningrad i found

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,600
myself in the midst of geola

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,079
a jerusalem neighborhood populated

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,160
mainly by

00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:52,160
ultra-orthodox jews

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,680
it's january 1990 a great chilly morning

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,719
i'm surrounded by ugly dirty buildings

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,960
and strange bearded man wearing

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,000
weirdest black overcoats and fedora

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,559
heads

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,760
i'm staring around me in shock and

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,400
disbelief

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,080
what is this where am i who are these

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,640
people

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,320
wishing desperately i was back in russia

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,080
surrounded by my friends

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,640
rock music perestroika but there was of

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,759
course

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,759
no going back in the upcoming years

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,119
israel never ceased to surprise me with

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,520
more and more of the things

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,799
nothing in my previous life has prepared

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,400
me for

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,360
it was a bumpy ride street fights drugs

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,759
alcohol even imprisonment one could say

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,880
it's a miracle that here i am today

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,280
a well-respected israeli citizen like

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,840
many of my fellow immigrants i found a

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,159
way to adapt to overcome the unexpected

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,479
challenges of the new reality

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,240
but there were also others those who

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,200
failed to acclimate and fell

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,920
victim to depression delinquency

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,439
addiction

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,560
suicide resilience

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:06,399
is the thing that helps some of us

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,399
adapt and succeed while others crumble

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,000
i was in no way better than those who

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,160
failed but there were certain

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,520
choices and actions i took that allowed

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,040
me to find

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,599
my place in my new home

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,040
as john also puts it resilience is not

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,480
something a system has

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,879
it's something a system does it's not a

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,520
property but rather an activity

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,239
resilience is the ability of a system to

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,120
withstand the unexpected adversities to

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,080
adapt

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,640
to the changes they require and then to

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,239
bounce

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,640
back now why am i talking about all this

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,760
at an

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,400
i.t conference why is resilience

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,560
becoming

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,120
top of mind for the most profound

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,360
visionaries of our industry

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,720
well it's because the systems that we're

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
building are becoming

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,560
more and more complex and unpredictable

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,840
interconnected

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,360
and chaotic while we become increasingly

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,400
dependent on them

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,920
for performing our expected capabilities

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,840
as a society

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,840
as a civilization how many production

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,000
incidents did you have in the last year

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,640
how many of those were expected how long

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,560
did it take you to come back to normal

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,319
as an industry we are coming to an

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,519
understanding that in distributed

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,239
complex system

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,080
a failure is a feature not a bug and

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,480
what really matters is the system's

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,040
resilience its ability to withstand the

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,400
failure

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,239
and recover now as engineers

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,560
we should be asking the question can

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,120
this be intentionally built

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,360
engineered can we build organizations in

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,720
such a way and consequently our systems

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,760
in such a way that they do more

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,200
resilience and do less brittleness

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,640
and the answer is maybe we somewhat

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
understand the principles and the

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,120
algorithms of how resilience

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,560
works but the paradox lies in the fact

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,319
that resilience

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,040
uh can only be tested when an unexpected

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,560
event occurs so like many other

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,599
activities in software delivery it's a

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,159
continuous quest

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,680
based on never ending learning and

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,159
adaptation

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,080
the quest has begun there's already a

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,760
lot of knowledge out there i'll happily

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,079
share the links on discord

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,120
but there's still a long road ahead of

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,840
us and it's up to us to walk that road

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,880
to build the resilient systems of

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,000
tomorrow

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,440
and then maybe just maybe we will

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,639
all be ready for the unexpected crap

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,639
that comes our way

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,639
thank you and yeah definitely i think

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,440
all of us

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,880
who have been operating uh in the past

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,759
production

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,120
issues we grew we hope our systems would

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,160
have had more resilience and

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,960
our personality would have resilience

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,400
to handle those issues as well and then

00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:05,520
we have manual fixes to help

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:05,520
