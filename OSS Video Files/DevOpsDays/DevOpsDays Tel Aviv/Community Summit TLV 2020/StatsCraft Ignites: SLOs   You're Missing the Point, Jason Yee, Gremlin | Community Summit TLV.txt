Title: StatsCraft Ignites: SLOs   You're Missing the Point, Jason Yee, Gremlin | Community Summit TLV
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Innovation is how you win customers; reliability is how you keep them. To succeed, you need both. But as organizations adopt Service Level Objectives (SLOs) as part of their Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices, they become fixated on reliability and innovation suffers. In this talk, I’ll discuss why you need to spend more time on innovation and how to do it. I’ll also share how you can escape your everyday toil and stressful firefighting to rediscover the fun in engineering—and help your company succeed at the same time!

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,960
going straight

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,359
to jason yee hello

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
how's it going great great how are you

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,760
doing

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,719
doing pretty good i've had

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,559
joining you from uh portland oregon so

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,399
northwest

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,680
so first of all thank you very much for

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,239
the early

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,600
morning wake up uh for us and then we're

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,559
very very happy to

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,440
have you with us um jason is from

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,280
gremlin

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,920
and he's going to talk to us about how

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,199
to balance your reliability

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,480
with innovation and we'll show the

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,520
recording and then we'll get back to

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:13,840
jason on that

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:13,840
good luck jason

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,240
an idea only becomes an innovation

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,119
if you build it turning

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,479
ideas into reality using software and

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,119
hardware

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,159
that's what you do and that's what your

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,360
company needs

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,680
in order to be successful

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,600
the other thing your company needs is to

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,399
be reliable

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
innovation is how you win customers and

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,759
reliability

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,640
is how you keep them you need both

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,680
you've probably heard a lot about slos

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,560
service level

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,119
objectives ever since google published

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,920
the site reliability engineering book

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,319
everyone has been adopting slos as a way

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,440
to ensure reliability

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,280
so what's an slo it's a goal defining

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,080
the quality of service you intend to

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,440
provide

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,080
in an objective well-measured way

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,480
for example setting the target that

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,720
ninety percent of your web transactions

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,920
will be error free and take less than

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,920
one second to complete

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,640
but if you're only focusing on slos and

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,760
reliability

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,560
you're missing the point the difference

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,760
between

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,640
100 perfect and your slo

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,120
is your error budget this is the time

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,640
you're

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,400
allowed to fail to be unreliable

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,480
while in the pursuit of innovation

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,959
like a financial budget the important

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,000
part isn't how much you've saved

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,120
but what that savings allows you to do

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,440
the ability to retire comfortably or to

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,159
buy a house or a new car

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,680
or in the case of air budgets to strive

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,480
for innovation

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,480
and fail without negative repercussions

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,599
because innovation is fraught with

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,560
failure

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,760
or as thomas edison once said i haven't

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,239
failed

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,640
i just found ten thousand ways that

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,120
didn't work

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,680
and he was right learning what doesn't

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,760
work

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
is just as important as learning what

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,280
does

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
the learning is important and it's the

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,840
key to successful

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,080
innovation as you pursue

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
innovation focus on learning and

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,640
prioritize

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,680
four things number one

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,599
validate your assumptions our systems

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,480
and applications are becoming more

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,519
and more complex even as we try to

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,239
simplify

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,000
we create abstractions that mask greater

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,920
complexity

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,360
this complexity means that the way

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,640
things really work

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,560
rarely matches the way we think they do

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,920
and if our mental models are flawed it

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,080
becomes impossible

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,319
to improve things or fix them when they

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,599
fail

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,280
number two reduce unknowns

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,639
when you're trying new things whether

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,280
it's a technology

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,320
or a new process the things that you

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,919
don't know

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,320
vastly outnumber the things that you do

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,360
even more critical are trying to reduce

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,160
your unknown

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,880
unknowns the things you don't know that

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,720
you don't know

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,120
validating assumptions and reducing

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,440
unknowns are why chaos engineering

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,880
intentionally causing failure in order

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,320
to learn more

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,479
is so important to innovation

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,720
intentional failure allows us to

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,360
validate how we think systems work

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,560
and it helps expose the areas that need

00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,960
more study

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,520
number three improve what already exists

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,639
innovation often appears like something

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,680
entirely new

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,000
and revolutionary but more often

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,440
it's a collection of minor improvements

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,680
that add up to big

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,800
changes number four

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,840
fail frugally we often hear the phrase

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,960
fail fast fail often

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,360
failing fast is being frugal with time

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,560
the failure can often be expensive

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
financially

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,400
or with your error budget failing

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,800
frugally means

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,039
setting up safeguards having the right

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,080
monitoring in place to quickly detect

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,400
problems

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,479
and using feature flags or canary

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,800
deployments to minimize the impact of

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,759
failure

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,600
ultimately validating our assumptions

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,600
reducing unknowns

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
improving what exists and failing

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,560
frugally will help you strike

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
the right balance it'll help you avoid

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,560
becoming

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,600
overly focused on reliability and it

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,840
will allow you

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,840
to innovate

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,240
thank you very much jason that was uh

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,240
very interesting actually uh

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
you know we we're used to uh hearing

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,800
about slos

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,240
uh in a very conservative uh context you

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,120
know because of the nature of

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,639
sre uh profession and obviously because

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,800
of the fact that that's how they're uh

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,680
incentivized so uh hearing that in the

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,479
context of uh

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,199
developing innovation is uh is actually

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,120
quite uh

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,319
refreshing in the in the discussion

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
there yeah

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,919
i feel like one of the challenges that

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,880
we have in what we do as you mentioned

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,599
is sre is

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,599
like and generally ops people and devops

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,400
people we're so focused on reliability

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,360
that

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,120
our jobs are often not fun anymore right

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
like you're so worried about oh what if

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,639
this incident happens in

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,720
preventing those that you forget like

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,639
why you started the job of like building

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,720
things and playing with technology

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,160
uh which i i think is important with

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,240
what we do

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,599
definitely definitely i agree with you

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,160
so thank you very much for sharing that

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,520
with us

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,680
and guys jason is with us

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,280
if you want to ask more questions please

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,080
join us and look for jason

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,080
on the discord thank you very much jason

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
