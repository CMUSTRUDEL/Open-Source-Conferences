Title: DevOpsDays Ignites: Waste Oriented, Hunch Based Web Architecture, Michael Zion, AppsFlyer | Communit
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Community Summit TLV
The software engineering field lacks hunch-based decisions.
It's oriented towards making things right, rather than going YOLO and enjoying life.
In my talk I'm suggesting an alternate approach, where production is important, but not as much as the feelings of the person changing production.

[Music]

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,880
so

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,600
next coming up is michael zion from

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,119
up flyer michael is the devops engineer

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,960
with appsflyer

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,439
who is going to talk about waste

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,199
oriented web architecture so

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,840
michael take it away thank you very much

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,920
so welcome to my talk i'll show my

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,000
screen

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,120
let's do it this way can you guys see my

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,520
screen

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,719
i mean i can tell you guys so i'm just

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,399
assuming we can

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,320
so i'm going to talk about waste

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,200
oriented hunch based engineering

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,160
and my name is michael i work at devops

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,239
as a

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,840
topspin as a devops engineer and uh

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,280
what does it mean in waste oriented

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,600
hunch-based engineering

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,440
before i begin actually it's this talk

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,120
for you so in every lecture and every

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,680
talk in every conference

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,199
the person talking saying hey i know

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,720
you're waiting for lunch i know you're

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,040
devastated by lunch

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,479
but i know i only have the ability to

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,159
catch the attention of the people who

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,240
always forget to eat

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,160
so that's just a side note i'm looking

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,240
at you guys

00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,720
[Music]

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,080
so i want to start by showing you some

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,560
concerning graphs

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,560
and the first graph is the importance of

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,479
production to engineers

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,240
opposed to the importance of feelings to

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,520
engineers and you can see

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,400
the importance of production to

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,400
engineers is constantly on the rise

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,960
uh which is very concerning while

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,280
feelings are pretty much stagnated

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,320
um another concerning graph is the

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,159
number of

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,960
cloud cost companies companies oriented

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,119
towards

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,399
saving your money as opposed to wasting

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,000
your money

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,920
for comparison you can see the number of

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,320
falafel shops stayed completely

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,360
stagnated

00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,159
so very concerning observations

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,520
i'm here to claim two things one is

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,640
feelings are more important than

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,399
production

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,159
and the second is wasting money is more

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,599
important than saving money

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,599
and i'll explain why uh so let's start

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,760
by wasting money

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,760
aristo said wasting money makes you look

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,840
rich now i don't really know if he

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,200
really said it but it really helps my

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,760
argument here

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,800
and the argument is that if you look

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,959
rich you feel better

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,879
and feeling better as i already

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,120
mentioned is extremely important

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,200
more than production so um

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,800
then you might ask me but how can you we

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,319
waste money in order to look rich in

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,519
order to feel better

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,280
and it's a good question um so

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,640
i'll show you a couple of ways the first

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,800
way is

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,879
by increasing increasing the traffic

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,360
cost let's say you have service 1

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,640
talking to service 2 via http in the

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,000
same data center

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,080
what you can do is you can deploy

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,800
service to in another data center

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,519
and then it triple or even quadruple the

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,400
costs

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,000
of the inbounded outbound traffic so

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,159
this is one way

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,920
another way to maximize cost is uh

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,040
maximize cpu usage

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,040
um and when i say cpu usage i mean let's

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,319
say service one is talking to service

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,720
two via http

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,720
the same as the previous example and he

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,360
sends a post request with a key

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,640
the key has a value what we can do is we

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
can hash the value

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,239
and since hash is not a reversible

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,840
function it would be very

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,000
uh hard for service 2 to get the real

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,560
value from the hash

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,400
so it really makes the cpu work harder

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,319
and it's another very efficient way to

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,280
maximize cost

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,400
but wait it's maximizing cost enough so

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,239
of course not your loan

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,879
you know the answer maximizing cost is

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,159
just a way to feel better you also have

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,400
to be able to ignore the

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,680
production burning and only once you

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,120
have this ability

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,840
only then you'll be truly happy and

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
this is when your feelings come to their

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,560
full potential

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,439
so uh this is where i introduce so kfi

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,080
okfi is a tool i built

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,959
in order to help you ignore production

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,040
and

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,319
for example you have a python test you

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,720
run the test

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,160
and then you pipe it into okay file

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,799
let's say the test fail

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,320
you get the response you want and it's

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,680
super important of course

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,880
so let's do a quick demo um first of all

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,000
i'll show you how you want

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,000
okay if i without anything special

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,520
just i okay if it's calculating a

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,919
non-offensive response

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,880
and it returns you the response you want

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,840
now let's

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,320
see the exit code exit code oh this is

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,360
lovely

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,960
so let's say i run a bad command

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,360
and the command is uh yelling at me

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,240
i feel terrible and if i look at the

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,400
exit code

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,919
you can see it's not zero this is just

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,680
terrible what can i do

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,520
i can type it into okay file and then

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,720
okay if i will calculate a non-offensive

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,840
response

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,639
and will uh give me the response code i

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,759
deserve

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,240
and another cool thing you can do is

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,639
you can pass the i'm offended flag when

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,000
you pass the offended flag

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,199
basically you get an apology instead and

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,560
there are a lot of interesting

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:23,600
integrations for example khalsa

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,120
so you can get a cow saying whatever it

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,840
is you wanted to say

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,960
and this is a tool to make this

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,720
philosophy

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,720
kind come to life and

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,320
in summary wasting money makes you feel

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,759
better

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,000
feelings are more important than

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,800
production and the tools promote

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,880
philosophies

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
and if you take one thing from this

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,759
stock

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,479
don't let it be the third one take

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,440
either the first one or the second one

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,360

engineer this is my twitter account my

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:07,840
github account and my makusharim account

thank you for listening

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
yeah i thought i think you're muted i

now i can hear you sorry about that yeah

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,319
so thank you michael and i just wanted

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,080
to say thank you for the tool i just

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,680
love it when my cli makes me feel good

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,520
about myself

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:31,360
amazing happy to be awesome thank you
