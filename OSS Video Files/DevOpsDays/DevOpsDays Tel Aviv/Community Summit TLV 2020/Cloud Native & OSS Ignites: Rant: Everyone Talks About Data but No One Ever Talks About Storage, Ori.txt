Description: 
	We live in a data driven world, and the data needs to be stored somewhere on some storage. This makes the storage a critical resource that may break your application and even lose all your data! Ignoring it just won’t work. You have to choose the right kind of storage for your workload: block, file or object. You need to use it wisely or you will lose performance and scale. You need to consider cost efficiency or pay a large bill in the end of the month You must make sure your data is secure by using best practices, access control and encryption. Don’t forget about Data protection as losing your data is a huge disaster!
