Description: 
	On average, any Instagram story gets 2 sec of attention from a person viewing it. Yes, that’s the speed with which we’re already consuming information. But, how much information can you get from a 2sec look at your monitoring? And if you just joined a company and it’s your first production incident today? I’m sure, using the right tools and thinking of monitoring as a product, it’s possible to build intuitive and user-friendly monitoring, which will dramatically reduce the amount of debugging and troubleshooting in your life. My talk is about how to do it, why it’s important to pay attention to it and how to measure results.
