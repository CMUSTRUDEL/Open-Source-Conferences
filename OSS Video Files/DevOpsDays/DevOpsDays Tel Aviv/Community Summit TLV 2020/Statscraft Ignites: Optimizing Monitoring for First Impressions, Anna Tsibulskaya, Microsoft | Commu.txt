Title: Statscraft Ignites: Optimizing Monitoring for First Impressions, Anna Tsibulskaya, Microsoft | Commu
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	On average, any Instagram story gets 2 sec of attention from a person viewing it. Yes, that’s the speed with which we’re already consuming information. But, how much information can you get from a 2sec look at your monitoring? And if you just joined a company and it’s your first production incident today? I’m sure, using the right tools and thinking of monitoring as a product, it’s possible to build intuitive and user-friendly monitoring, which will dramatically reduce the amount of debugging and troubleshooting in your life. My talk is about how to do it, why it’s important to pay attention to it and how to measure results.

microsoft and you're going to talk to us

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,760
about optimizing monitoring for first

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,360
impressions right right great so

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,440

great so anna the floor is yours i'm

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,640
going out

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,359
thank you so my name is anna and

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,600
i work as sre at microsoft and i'll talk

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,880
today about optimizing monitoring for

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,520
first impressions

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,280
uh it's a pretty short talk so i will

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,920
just touch the subject and then

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,159
talk about one side of it but i hope to

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,360
inspire you for more sultan

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,840
um agenda for today is the first part

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,920
about

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,840
uh what our goals of monitoring for

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,320
production incidents and why we're doing

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,119
it

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,600
at all uh second what matters when time

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,840
matters and the short summary

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,960
so goals of monitoring for production

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,799
incidents for it

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,079
is to understand if there is a

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,079
production incident

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,520
is production healthy and if everything

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,600
is okay with it

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,520
and second whenever protection is

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,200
unhealthy how can we recover

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,479
as soon as possible um

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,040
and while production incidents usually

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,000
at time matters the most because we want

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
to recover as fast

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
as possible because downtime actually

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,399
equals some

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,000
money loss and what we're not usually

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,320
paying enough attention to is that

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,560
usability and comprehensibility of

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,439
monitoring is basically a factor to our

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,440
downtime

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,920
because with a good usability of

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,120
monitoring and with clear metrics with

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,400
understandable dashboards we can fix

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,239
things faster

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,680
without spending time to understand

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,560
what's happening or

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,520
to find some specific dashboard and then

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,160
our downtime basically shortens

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,440
so what matters when time matters during

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,160
a production incident

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,760
first of all being super obvious and not

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,160
wasting any time

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,640
it's what saves time and what i mean

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,400
here is that

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,560
basically you should have monitoring

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,920
already in place it shouldn't be added

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
on

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,760
right in the moment of uh an incident

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,800
and

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,840
it should be thought through before um

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,879
second minimal contact switch if you

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,879
have

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,640
i know five different dashboards which

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,560
you have to take a look at and you're

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,360
opening it in five different types of a

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,200
browser

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
and for example your graphana works on

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,000
me in chrome while kibana only can

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,519
be supported in firefox then you always

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,680
need to switch between

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,760
tabs and browsers and you're basically

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,000
wasting time

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,959
which is also a bit obvious but a third

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,360
part is

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,840
less obvious and i will focus on it the

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,000
most is about user experience of

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,400
monitoring and for showing what i mean

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,319
by user experience and showing some

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,159
small part of it which is

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,799
very easy to apply and

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,720
very cheap actually i'll show you just

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,879
an example

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,840
so let's imagine something failed in

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,640
production

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,000
of course i assume you already have some

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,920
monitoring in place and

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,400
that monitoring for example produced

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,879
some log with that production status

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,799
um let's check few different options how

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,360
to present the same log

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,760
keeping in mind our goals of monitoring

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,000
so first options straightforward just to

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,280
show

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,680
a log we can see here that it contains

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
some ips some data centers

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,439
version of some service and the status

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,480
if the production is down or

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,959
up um one of the goals

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,720
first call is of monitoring is to know

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,720
if production is healthy or not

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,639
we can straightforward see here that

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,280
production is not healthy at least

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,560
part of production um because here some

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,040
statuses are up

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,600
but basically from a first glance we

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,000
can't

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,960
tell what happened and what is the root

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,120
cause of our problems in production

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,080
let's change a very small thing just the

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,320
font color

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280
uh it changed the font color for the

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,080
status

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,000
down is that red and up is green now and

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,919
we already can see that it's

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,280
half half of production is down and half

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,199
of production is up

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,919
um basically if we have a 50

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,759
redundancy we can be kind of calm

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,759
already because we know that

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,440
at least part of the system or at least

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,759
the system has chance to be still

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,400
working for customers and it's fine

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,720
um but we still cannot see

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,520
straightforward the reason what happened

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,639
option three i just put the same data

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,720
into a table

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,960
and if we will look at the slide for

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,080
long enough we will see already what's

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,639
the reason of

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,720
of our problems in production so i

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,360
assume you already know what the problem

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
is but

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,199
i will still continue here i use the

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,560
same table

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,800
just order it by status we can see

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
first part status down and send status

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,600
up and

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,199
we can see here that all the down is

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,919
coming from dc1 so

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,240
obviously the problem is in this one and

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,840
it's not related to a zone and it's not

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
related to version

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,680
but there is another option five to show

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,479
it visualized

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,280
and we can see for example if we show it

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,919
like this

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,440
we can see that dc1 is fully down while

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,840
dc2 is fully up

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,759
and it doesn't depend on the version for

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,800
example

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,960
um all this represents the same data

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,080
it's a pretty straightforward and small

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,199
example just to give you

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,520
an inspiration to look more at it so

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,280
summaries obviously time is important

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,080
during production incidents

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,400
uh usability understandability and user

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,800
experience of monitoring saves time

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
and visual optimization is just one

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,560
thing to an

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,199
end but don't stop there and as steve

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,440
jobs said

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,440
simple can be harder than complex you

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,280
have to work hard to get your thinking

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,199
clean and make it simple

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
but it's worth it in the end because

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,080
once you get there you can move

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,560
mountains

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,560
thank you

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,759
thank you natalie great talk uh i i

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
think it's it's uh the beginning of a

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,520
new

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,520
profession the uh production ux the guy

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,360
that will actually be ux designers

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,360
dedicated to the dashboards for uh

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,840
yeah that would be great but if you

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,360
still don't have production ux you can

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,199
just ask your

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,639
product unix to help you with that i

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,199
think they will be happy

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,479
stealing resources is always a favorite

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,680
profession

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:16,080
thank you very much for your talk

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:16,080
