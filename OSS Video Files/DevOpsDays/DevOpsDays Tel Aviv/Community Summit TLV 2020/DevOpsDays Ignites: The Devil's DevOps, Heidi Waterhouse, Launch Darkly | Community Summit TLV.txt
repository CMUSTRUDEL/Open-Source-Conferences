[Music]

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,120
but

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,560
in the meantime we are continuing with

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,880
our ignite stocks so

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,640
i'm going to welcome a heidi waterhouse

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,760
from a launch darkly

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,320
so take it away hey

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,000
i've recorded the talk for you and i'm

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
really excited that i get to talk to you

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,440
all again this year because i miss you

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,160
and i miss tel aviv

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,480
so i hope that you enjoy this talk about

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,320
sarcastic definitions of devops words

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,760
and let me pull that up

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,760
but let's go to the video

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,199
hi my name is heidi waterhouse i'm here

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,879
from launch darkly to talk to you

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,960
about some devops terms that you may

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,120
have been using wrong all along

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,280
i hope this satirical take helps you

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,680
understand where it is that the industry

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,119
is actually going

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,880
the cloud is just other people's servers

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,560
we know that but it's also an

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,560
abstraction layer for people who can't

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,240
get the budget to buy hardware to do the

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,520
things that they need

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,720
and it's the vaporous form of pixie dust

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,000
it's like magic infrastructure is

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,960
something that we labor

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,280
to simultaneously uphold and reform like

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,479
changing the tires on a car as it runs

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,320
down the road

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,320
it's really a thrill every minute

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
continuous integration is the state of

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,880
never being sure that you didn't just

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,880
build the

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,040
break the build if you're deploying all

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,680
the time then you could be breaking the

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,159
build

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
all the time in production it gives it

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,720
that extra special

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,520
exciting thrill automation is the

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,759
process of

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,960
making things fail without requiring

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,719
human oversight

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,399
if you automate something that gives you

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,960
time to do more thinking

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,920
about important new failures that you

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,959
could introduce into your systems

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,520
deployment

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,120
is when code escapes from where we keep

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,200
it into public view

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,480
and it's also the thing that just took

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,720
down production

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:25,200
and deployment is a wily devil like that

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,520
testing in production is a variant

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,000
pronunciation of yolo

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,920
you only live once it's also a great way

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,239
to find errors at scale that you might

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,840
miss

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,840
in smaller scale production

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,440
mean time to recovery is a measurement

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,280
of how long

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,120
it takes to stand things back up while

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,440
somebody is yelling at you and

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,840
how many swear words they use when they

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,840
describe how they feel about your outage

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,720
microservice is a small independent

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,519
operation

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,840
that allows you to infinitely increase

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,519
the complexity of your testing problems

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,959
every microservice you add is a

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,959
combinatoric multiplier

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,560
silo is a security device to keep

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,560
information from one part of the company

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,000
from getting into any other part of the

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,080
company they're

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,519
very rigid and very secure and i think

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,519
everybody is going to adopt them

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,040
nines are a unit of failure the more

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,280
nines you have

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
the more expensive they get out to

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,640
infinity and

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,480
anything that happens reduces all of

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,080
your nines

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,080
they're just hard to maintain that way

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,720
observability is the ability to tell

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,560
what has gone wrong in your system with

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,120
a high degree of cardinality

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,680
so even if it's not up at least you can

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,280
tell

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,519
who asked for the thing that made it go

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,519
down

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,439
a b testing is a way to show a new bug

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,040
to only half your customers at a given

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,959
time

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,959
it gives you that great feeling of

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,080
making sure that this can still see the

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,080
old bugs if they need them

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
chaos engineering is introducing poo

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
flinging monkeys

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,959
into your production environment on

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
purpose so that you can tell where the

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,199
poo

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,560
is going to fall or fly and whether it

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,560
will hit the rotary impeller

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,479
remote code execution is a way to make

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,639
magic happen at a distance

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,800
it might seem like a scary thing in a

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,440
security sense but that's only a problem

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
for

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,720
entities and companies that aren't

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,160
magical and obviously your companies are

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
magical so you're fine

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,800
don't worry event driven architecture

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,560
are systems designed around

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,720
messages being received hopefully and or

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,080
architecture designed around conferences

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,800
so that we can talk about them

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,800
that's an event

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,520
ticketing is a way to assert positive

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,120
ownership over something

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,520
so that you can pass the buck more

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,360
effectively a ticketing system is just a

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,160
really efficient way to get other people

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,160
to do more work

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,720
source control is a layer of software

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,720
used for hosting merge conflicts

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,080
and pointers to sketchy dependencies

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,280
that you didn't know you needed as much

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,280
as it turns out you need

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,880
serverless is code that you run on

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,960
somebody else's servers

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,919
you can also look up sleight of hand and

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,520
ledger domain

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,280
for things that appear to happen in one

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,400
place but actually happen in another

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,400
place

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,520
no trickery happening here

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,120
autonomy finally is the ability to get

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,440
good and messed up without needing to

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,919
have

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,520
any meanings about it if all of the

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,600
blame can be attributed to you

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,840
then you are an autonomous person in

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,840
your organization

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
congratulations

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,039
awesome awesome thank you thank you hey

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,960
uh i just wonder what was the thing that

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,120
got you to make this slide right

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,000
obviously people ask us different things

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,080
and mean diff

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,919
other things and confuse terminology so

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,199
what was the thing that brock you broke

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,400
you and made you

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,600
make those lights uh so

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,560
josh zimmerman who does uh devops days

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,680
madison did

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,039
a uh jack handy's deep thoughts about

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,960
uh devops and i had been reading

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,240
ambrose pierce's devil's dictionary and

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,280
i'm like what if

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,440
i just explained devops in

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,639
in ways that are both true and sort of

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,720
painful that we don't want to think

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,000
about

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,680
interesting yeah cool so thank you very

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
much haiti thank you very much for that

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,360
now i think we have common language to

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,840
speak among ourselves

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,840
