Title: DevReL IL Ignites: Monitoring People   An Engineering Approach to Human KPIs, Erik Zaadi, Salto | Co
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Feel like understanding systems is easier and more logical than people? Let's challenge that and see how engineering practices such as monitoring and CI can be correlated to understanding and improving humans, you know, those illogical chaotic beings, which are sooooo much different than production.

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,520
thank

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,439
hey well i guess i'm on there now so

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,000
hello everyone if you could just put my

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,000
slide on

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,719
awesome so yeah uh i'll be talking about

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,160
monitoring people

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,320
hopefully not in a creepy way i'm eric

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,600
i'm a developer at an awesome company

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,760
called salto

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,960
before i started my epic adventure at

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,399
salto

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,640
i used to be a manager for a couple

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,199
years so now currently

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,800
i'm an ic i don't do any managing at all

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,320
except

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,559
raid leading every now and then in world

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,800
of warcraft but i'll try to

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,840
show this talk with the prospective vote

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
as an ic

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,239
and as a manager and let's dive into it

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,720
i'm going to talk about an engineering

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,840
approach

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,520
to understanding human kpis

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,119
we're very proficient with how we're

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,439
monitoring production right

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,400
we're doing top bottom monitoring we're

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,560
having very clear

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,080
kpis which indicate the actual business

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,400
value of what we're doing

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,400
we have metrics supporting those kpis

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,280
but they are defined as metrics for

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,920
example

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,439
if we have a metric on a 100 cpu and

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,600
we're getting alerts from those

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,960
that might be interesting but as long as

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,360
no customer is

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,159
being impacted by that that's just noise

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,680
right we're not

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:41,200
we're fine within our main kpi however

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,399
with humans it's a bit uh

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,320
harder because it's really difficult to

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,040
try to measure human beings how do you

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,360
even measure

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,479
a successful employee how can i measure

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,880
myself as a

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,040
good employee is it the amount of chair

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,200
tickets that i just eat through

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,159
is it the amount of mergers or deploys

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,360
they're doing whether

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,079
they're successful or not is it the

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,560
amazing

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,119
lines of code that i'm just shooting out

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,399
is it

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,319
my ability to do 100 test coverage

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,959
or just how much you hear me in meetings

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,879
uh well all of those might be metrics

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,319
for some companies but they're really

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,080
hard to say that they are really

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,160
pointing to a true kpi

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,640
that is showing that i'm giving an

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,599
impactful value on the business right

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,920
uh for example jira tickets i can you

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,000
know

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,599
to be amazing in a sprint and do a

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,519
tri-zillion year tickets but

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,040
those might not have any impact on

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,000
what's really important right now so

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,040
that might be

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,720
just noise it's not really a kpi

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,920
so can you really have kpi for humans

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,760
well uh to have kpis you need to

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,280
understand what drives humans and what

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,599
makes humans work better

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,480
there are a lot of good resources about

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,160
how happy humans make amazing impact

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,159
but this is a very short ignite so i

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,000
can't share them all but you'll have to

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,640
trust me on this that happy people

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,159
are more loyal and they will invest more

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,159
hours they will care more and they will

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,959
do things better be more professional

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,080
if they're happy at your company so

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,560
knowing that

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,560
how can we make people happy how can i

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,319
ensure as an employee that i'm happy at

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,560
the company that i work for

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,480
well it start with having the gist of

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,440
why i'm doing what i'm doing right now

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,519
right and how

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,200
what i'm doing right now is impacting

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,640
the business it's actually giving

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,200
value it follows up with

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,720
a being able to take ownership if i have

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
a certain level of freedom

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,760
that will allow me to step up take

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,159
responsibility

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,920
and have ownership about of something i

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,680
will care more about it i will be more

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,920
proficient i will share knowledge about

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,640
it etc etc

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,000
in addition every human being wants to

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,000
be a part of something

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,519
the more i know about other people in

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,599
people's efforts whether it's

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,640
wins or pain that will be better for me

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,159
i can perhaps

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,920
offer to help if it's something i know

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,280
about or learn for some

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,879
somebody else and if there's something i

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,680
want you to remember from this talk

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,720
is you can allow people to give value by

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,799
letting them feel

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,400
valuable it's very simple you do

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,280
continuous feedback

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,760
and you have a culture of nurturing of

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,519
making people

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,280
learn from mistakes instead of being

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,120
afraid of mistakes because then they

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,400
will just cover up mistakes and make

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,919
make worse ones so

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,280
i'm an engineer right show me the

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,800
dashboard for all this show me the

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,800
metrics i want to get alerts

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,160
if i'm not happy or not preferring me

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
right right

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,479
well it's not that easy because every

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,240
person is a snowflake right as a manager

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,160
you need to talk to your people

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
as an employee i need to define my own

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,320
personal kpis

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,160
to do things correctly how can i do that

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,800
well it starts with having very clear

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,880
goals

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,479
for example for the next quarter i want

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
to lead a feature from design to

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,960
production

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,960
i want to work in a tech stack that i'm

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,759
not necessarily comfortable

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,040
and you should follow up with that clear

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,919
goal that kpi with

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,680
very clear metrics and those should all

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,960
always start halfway that should never

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,479
only be in the end

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,240
like for instance if i want to lead a

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,240
feature i want to gather information for

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,320
all the stakeholders for what is needed

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
i want to coordinate different resources

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,000
if it's teams etc

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
check all those check marks while you're

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,560
going through this to make sure you're

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,360
on the correct

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,800
course and just as in production it

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,800
doesn't end when you

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,320
finish your deploy right you need to

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,000
measure over time that

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,720
this kpi this clear goal that you've

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,120
defined is it does business impact

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,960
and it actually customers are using it

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,919
and so forth

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,280
so since this is a very short ignite and

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,080
i jumped on a little early

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,039
i got to summarize this really quick

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,960
humans can hate

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,479
kpis and they should have them it's

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,080
really hard to do that because there's

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,720
no single template that works for

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,360
everyone

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,320
but it's worth it having happy employees

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,360
having a

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,880
still kpis will make them work much more

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,400
in a fun environment and

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,560
be where more impactful uh

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,160
surprisingly we're hiring at salto you

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,080
can check out the careers thing

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,919
my guild in world of warcraft called

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
lazy peons is also recruiting if you

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,240
want to

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,319
dm me in twitter discord whatever is

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
comfortable and you're fine to do that

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,120
as well

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,319
and that's it i've been eric and i hope

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,919
you enjoyed this talk

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,600
awesome thank you thank you eric

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,440
definitely learning from our own

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
experience is quite important learning

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
from our own metrics

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:31,759
is quite important so thank you thank

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,759
