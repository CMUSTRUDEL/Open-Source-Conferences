00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,960
ready do you see my screen yep take it

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,600
away

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,240
all right hi everyone this is victoria

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,600
joef

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,759
from oracle mysql and

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
this year i have the pleasure to be here

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,439
with you for

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,000
this short talk about the hottest mysql

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,759
topics

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,040
in 2020 2020 is a particular year but

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,320
we didn't stop working we have a lot of

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,600
hot stuff which we want to bring

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,759
to you so let's get started

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,399
first off cloud so cloud is a big thing

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,200
and a couple of months ago we have

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,799
released

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,680
our managed service in oracle cloud so

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,640
mysql database service

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
with an addition which is called

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,600
heatwave

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,159
which implements real-time analytics

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,399
so you can see here you can get actually

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,759
if you contact us you can get the free

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,040
500. trial for to test

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,080
the mysql database manage service in

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,160
oracle cloud

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,000
with real-time analytics platform this

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,440
is going to be

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,319
a big revolution when it comes to mysql

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,560
world but

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,519
it is not the only one the second

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
big topic is in the field of high

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,840
availability

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,400
so we are working year over year to

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
improve

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,800
our high availability solution which is

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,959
mysql in adb cluster which

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,080
delivers automated failover

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,440
and automated recovery and automated

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,519
conflict resolution

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,400
so this is now a very well matured

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,680
solution

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,200
in the field of high availability

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,200
with mysql

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:11,200
then the third hot big topic is

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,239
security so we are working also to

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,120
improve security on mysql database and

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,800
around

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,200
your data and the

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,640
big thing about securities contained

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,920
about in mysql enterprise edition which

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,040
allows you to get support assessment

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,040
prevention

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:37,680
and detection on of security risks

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,680
on-premise and in the cloud

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,120
also a big thing a big movement in the

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,560
world

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,760
it's actually devops and with devops

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,319
we bring you an improved and a lot of

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,519
improvements in mysql shell if you

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,720
remember mysql

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,480
shell is this this is this futuristic

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,840
client which i spoke about

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,920
exactly one year ago at this conference

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,720
and it allows to integrate with devops

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,360
tools devops methodologies thanks to the

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,720
fact that

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,760
it's easy it's done for scripting

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,120
and it's done to embed several apis

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,840
and several additional plugins it embeds

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
the api

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,800
to work with high availability so we

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,759
read the previously presented in adb

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,360
cluster

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:33,520
and it embeds tools which is the

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
migration to cloud

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,040
the other very big thing is

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,000
microservices i don't know if you know

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,520
that mysql

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
can run in microservices so it can run

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,280
in

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,720
docker and kubernetes thanks to the

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,280
official mysql containers which are

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,800
officially supported and distributed by

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,280
us and we actually

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,000
this year was a big year when it comes

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,120
to micro

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,400
services because we actually

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,680
saw a lot of customers moving the mysql

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,199
installations

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,800
onto microservices so it's a good year

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,919
to think about this

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,199
and this was all from my side i hope you

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,880
enjoyed

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,000
this short presentation this about the

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,360
hottest mysql

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,840
topics in 2020 hope to see you

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:35,360
