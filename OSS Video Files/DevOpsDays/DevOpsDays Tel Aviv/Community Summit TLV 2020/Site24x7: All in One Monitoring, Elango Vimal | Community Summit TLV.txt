site24x7 i'll be presenting you

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,880
uh this session on all-in-one monitoring

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,759
so site24x7 is a product of zoho

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
corporation

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,280
i'm not sure how many of you have heard

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,040
about zoho zoho it's in a software

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,399
business for the past 25 years

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
with three different products in its

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,920
portfolio like server work online and

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,079
manage engine

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
site 24 7 is a combination of zoho

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,000
workflow and manage engine so manage

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,360
engine

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,280
is offering uh 30 plus

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,119
applications i mean monitoring and

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,759
management applications

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,439
on-premise and site24x7 is a cloud-based

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,960
i mean a sas based product which offers

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,959
30 plus applications again

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,879
so servo has 50 million users across the

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,000
globe and management has one million

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,360
enterprise customers

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
across the globe so site24x7 is

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,920
brought up with an idea of monit i mean

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,840
supporting the monitoring

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,280
from the cloud so we are offering the

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,480
managing monitoring module

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,720
under the name site 247 yeah so what is

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,160
the use of site 24 7 i mean i want to

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,160
show you uh

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,959
the problem that every infrastructure i

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,280
mean every organization is facing while

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,319
using multiple tools in their

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,160
environment

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,080
so site24x7 was brought up with an idea

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,120
of eradicating multiple tools in your

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
environment so if you take an

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160
environment

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,599
each and every organization is using at

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,840
least 10 different tools

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,440
in their infrastructure so a developer

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,720
who will be using a different tool an

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,080
operations team will be using a

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,360
different tool

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
the network team will be using a

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
different tool and i t support so you

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
will be having 10 different tools in

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
your organization

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,879
and it is an old method that you are

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
using

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,080
in case if you are using multiple tools

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,120
in your organization

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,959
so the the idea of site24x7 is to bring

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,720
everything under one single console so

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,560
we are supporting a full stack

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
monitoring solution

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,239
so we'll be able to monitor the end user

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,000
layer where you can monitor the end

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,640
users experience

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,319
and how they are viewing your web page

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,959
like availability monitoring

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,799
the web page analysis you can also

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,560
monitor the user's experience under real

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,959
user monitoring when it comes to

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,599
application layer you will be able to do

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,959
the troubleshooting of your apns i mean

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,599
your application

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,159
like java.net php ruby on rails or

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,000
node.js even python now

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,159
and when it comes to platform layer you

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
have the feasibility of adding plugins

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,400
to any monitor plugins in the sense you

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,080
can write the script and you can monitor

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
any application so you can write your

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,239
plugins in python shell

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,280
vb powershell script and you can monitor

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,400
any applications like

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,680
tomcat apache whatever you name it

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,439
and when it comes to infrastructure

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,159
layer you'll be able to monitor your

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,879
servers

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,799
cloud infrastructures like amazon web

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,680
services azure monitoring and you can

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,519
also do

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,519
the network monitoring as well so we are

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,440
covering all the four layers of your

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,079
full stack and you'll be able to monitor

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,479
everything on

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,680
under one single console so let me give

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,360
you an uh

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,120
idea on what is the difference between

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,120
develops i mean a developer an

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,520
operator and how we combine our devops

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,440
here so the purpose of a developer is to

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,160
make sure that their application

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,199
is working fine without any latency they

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,639
have to make sure

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,040
the end user experience is perfect with

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,560
with their own devices whatever the os

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,400
version mac or

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,960
windows or mobile devices that they're

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,680
using they have to make sure that their

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,280
code i mean the new update or the build

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,639
update doesn't downgrade or degrade

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,560
their performance and they

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,040
have also make sure that the mean time

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,320
to repair for each and every issues is

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,320
very minimal

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,639
whereas on the other hand the operator's

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,240
responsibility is to make sure at the

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,080
end customers perspective so they have

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,320
to make sure that that their web

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,360
application or their application is i

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,600
mean available

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,199
all the time for their end users and

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
they also have to make sure

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,199
that their infrastructure and its

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,320
application metrics are integrated

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,080
and they have to address the inducer

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,000
complaints immediately and they have

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,680
also make sure the performance analytics

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,520
i mean by setting a threshold for

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,440
every attributes for example like

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,120
response time so if the response time

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,240
exceeds they have to receive an alert

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,120
they have to bring back the

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,520
psycho-normal so site 24 7 process is to

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
bring

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,960
all these operations in one single

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,400
console so you'll be able to monitor

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,400
both the devops

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,479
i mean developer and operator that the

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,199
devops insight 24 7

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,960
for let it be apm insight or log

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,360
management or server monitoring or

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,039
website monitoring

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,479
so that's what we are showing here so

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,160
you can do website monitoring server

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,840
monitoring cloud monitoring network

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
monitoring app log analysis

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,120
real user monitoring and application

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,160
performance in one single

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,800
window and site24x7 is

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,639
not just one single tool it does it has

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,120
the artificial intelligence capability

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,000
so we

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,840
analyze every data and we will alert you

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,160
whenever there is a anomaly

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,520
and you can define reports integrate

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
with third party application

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,840
and receive notification anywhere

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,400
anytime and the power of site24x7 is it

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,880
has

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,080
it is three different modules now so

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,919
site24x7

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,600
as a monitoring tool status iq is a

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,120
public status page which helps you to

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,360
maintain the transparency

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,240
to your end users and cloud spend will

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,759
help you to

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,319
do the budgeting for your cloud

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,840
infrastructure like amazon web services

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,800
or azure monitoring that's all from

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,199
today so you

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,960
