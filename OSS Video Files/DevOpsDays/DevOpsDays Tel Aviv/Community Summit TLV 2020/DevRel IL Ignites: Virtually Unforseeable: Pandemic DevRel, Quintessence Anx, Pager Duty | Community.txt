Title: DevRel IL Ignites: Virtually Unforseeable: Pandemic DevRel, Quintessence Anx, Pager Duty | Community
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	One of the hardest parts professionally during this pandemic is how to shift a role that was mostly face-to-face and high travel to being 100% virtual - without losing the connection that in person interaction provides. This has led to a lot of growing pains over the past 8 months (!!!), but as a company cornerstoned in process we adapted our workflow to accommodate our New Abnormal. This is a 5 minute talk where I will run through how we shifted our workflow, not just by top loading already virtual content like blog posts but also focusing on other ways that the advocacy team could assist the business as a whole including shifting how to handle virtual events, booth duty, changes in how to present at virtual events, and more.

[Music]

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,679
and

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,399
we are here with queen

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,640
that is challenging today my

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,360
articulation abilities

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,680
not only with her name but with the top

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,000
named virtually

00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,879
unforeseeable pandemic dev reel

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,879
good luck win and don't forget to show

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,640
your slides

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,640
i will not forget to share my slides and

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
thank you so much for the intro you did

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,719
great

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,719
all right

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,520
you also get to see my christmas tree

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,000
apparently while i was doing this

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,800
so as he said my name is quintessence

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,800
and shabbat shalom

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,920
i think i messed that up but we're going

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,240
to keep going with it and i'm a

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,320
developer advocate at page duty

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
and in the before times we had of a lot

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,280
of experiences

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,520
with both digital content and in-person

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,680
content so there was a mixture of events

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,799
that looked like this right offices

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,200
meetups etc

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,960
conferences and we also have blogs and

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,479
webinars and at this point for the most

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,280
part the digital content was digital

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,119
native so

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,880
that is to say it was made to be digital

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
and consumed that way

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,479
and on the other hand in this new

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,400
abnormal everything looks like this

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,159
for me right now for content creators

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,079
for content consumers

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,479
the in-person content has been quickly

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,920
converted to digital as best as possible

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,000
which has reduced the variety of

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,360
learning experiences and in turn this

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,560
has altered the way we interact with

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,520
digital content

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,159
as our only way to communicate and how

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
so well

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,200
if you're in a meeting or a meet-up or a

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,640
conference again like this one you're

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,159
usually present

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,000
even if you have distractions coming

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,360
through but now people are multitasking

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,320
so they're streaming content while

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,560
working

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,320
or doing podcasts and things like that

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,239
and so people also

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,520
because of this prefer to spend shorter

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,360
periods of time with that digital

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,440
content so the conferences are shorter

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
and the blogs and such are shorter

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,120
and even with those restrictions it's

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
really important to find a way to meet

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,879
community needs digitally native for an

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,720
easier experience overall

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,560
rather than necessarily always trying to

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,480
convert that content so that makes our

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,160
primary goal to find ways to maximize

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,800
the use of digital native content and

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,400
tooling

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,920
to meet those needs using the common

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,519
tool sets to limit barriers to entry

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,680
and in order to get started we went a

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,959
little meta because at page duty we are

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,959
obsessed with process

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,319
so we did an analysis of our processes a

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,080
gas analysis

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,760
and in order to do this we established a

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,000
new baseline after shutdown

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,599
to see what information was changing

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
what was temporary during the initial

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,440
shift

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
and what was going to remain kind of

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,519
indefinitely

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,800
and that led to what's a gap for

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,879
community because there are a lot of

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
interdependencies between in-person

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,319
and digital in the four times you might

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,080
promote a webinar at a conference or a

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,840
meet-up on a community forum

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
and so you also need to account for

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,959
those supporting pipelines getting

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,319
content ideas from the so-called hallway

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,720
track etc

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,440
so all these in-person pieces are the

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,000
gaps

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,920
as defined in this gaps analysis and

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,599
when we were doing the gaps analysis we

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,360
used our knowledge of how devrel is

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,080
valuable to pagerduty as a business to

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,080
triage

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,000
essentially we were looking at converted

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400
content that struggled and what needs

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,239
where

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
i met around those as well as looking

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,280
for gaps around how we were meeting

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,280
needs overall within the digital

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,159
landscape and lining all of that up

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,239
with pagerdutydevro and we found that we

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,440
could meet a previously unmet need via

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,360
web conferencing

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,519
basically again using existing digital

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
tools and one of the ways that devrel

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,560
helps business at page duty is we do

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,200
some internal advocacy work with

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,239
customers

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
not product marketing or sales so what

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,760
was that need we actually ended up

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,799
finding that customers also struggled

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,599
with their process

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
and notification flows and so we

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,040
basically reinvented

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,560
notifications as a service and you may

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,640
now be wondering if i built this whole

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,879
deck as a setup for that joke

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,239
and the answer is maybe but the answer

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,120
is also that we found a way to help

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,799
developers

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
we do this by looking at one section of

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,159
their infra and teaching them what they

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
need to do in order to reconfigure

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,079
reword and reroute notifications and

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,919
then they can apply that to the rest

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,519
and to be a little more specific we ask

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,680
the team or teams to walk us through

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,840
what happened if or what happens when

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,600
for the different notification flows and

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,360
this helps us to identify things that

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,560
need to be more succinctly worded or if

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,000
notifications are firing when they

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
shouldn't if they're failing to when

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,919
they should

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,680
if they're not finding the correct

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,560
people and if they're learning on the

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,600
correct criteria

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,240
and so on and why did this happen now

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,840
couple of reasons one is that while

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,199
these meetings could be done in person

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,560
we're all currently borderless

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,240
and by that i mean we can do these

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
process flows with different teams at

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
different companies in different regions

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,840
while sitting in the same chair and the

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,360
other reason was our mindset we were

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,840
looking at our gaps analysis from a new

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
state of mind

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,440
and mindset matters so not only is it

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,199
important to take a look at your

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,880
workflows regularly it's also important

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,880
to do it from a new perspective and this

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,720
can be really challenging if the overall

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,560
environment is roughly the same

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,919
that said you can make your process of

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
processes more resilient by

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,320
experimenting

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,160
even just thought experiments where you

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,720
map out the knowns try to eliminate

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
pieces

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,240
and see how work reroutes around them or

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,080
needs to be redefined

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,759
try to figure out what work is core and

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,479
needs to be done even if experience is

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,680
altered

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,240
and which can be temporarily or

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,600
permanently removed ask what work fills

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,199
the gaps you created while staying

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
aligned with what is needed for devrel

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,919
and your org

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,440
and see what you can test in prod so to

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,479
speak

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,160
and with that thank you very much

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,759
my name is quintessence and again i'm a

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,759
developer advocate at pagerduty i'll be

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,080
in the discord answering any questions

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,320
thank you very much queen it was super

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,840
nice

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
for you

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,560
what sorry i didn't catch it you're good

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,199
yeah now we can in the evening we will

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:19,120
light the candles and eat some donuts

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:19,120
