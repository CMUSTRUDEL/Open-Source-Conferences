Description: 
	One of the hardest parts professionally during this pandemic is how to shift a role that was mostly face-to-face and high travel to being 100% virtual - without losing the connection that in person interaction provides. This has led to a lot of growing pains over the past 8 months (!!!), but as a company cornerstoned in process we adapted our workflow to accommodate our New Abnormal. This is a 5 minute talk where I will run through how we shifted our workflow, not just by top loading already virtual content like blog posts but also focusing on other ways that the advocacy team could assist the business as a whole including shifting how to handle virtual events, booth duty, changes in how to present at virtual events, and more.
