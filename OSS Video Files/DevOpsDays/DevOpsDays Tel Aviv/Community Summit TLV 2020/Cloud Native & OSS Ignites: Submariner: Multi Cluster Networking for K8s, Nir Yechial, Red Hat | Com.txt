Description: 
	With standard Kubernetes networking, connectivity is limited to a single cluster only, requiring proxies to connect workloads across clusters for migration, disaster-recovery, or geographic locality. Submariner is an open source project that enables high-performance cross-cluster connectivity and Service Discovery between different Kubernetes clusters, either on-premises or in the cloud. With Submariner, your applications and services can span multiple cloud providers, datacenters, and regions.
