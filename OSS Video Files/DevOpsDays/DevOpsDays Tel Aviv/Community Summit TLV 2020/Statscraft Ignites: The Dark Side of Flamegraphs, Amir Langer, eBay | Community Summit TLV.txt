Title: Statscraft Ignites: The Dark Side of Flamegraphs, Amir Langer, eBay | Community Summit TLV
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Flamegraph is a visualization of hierarchical data used to show sampling profiling results. We found them to be extremely useful observability tools. At eBay, we use Flamegraphs to triage performance problems and visualize service behaviour in production. In this talk we’ll go over Flamegraphs, their strengths and limitations. We’ll also explore ideas to extend the technology especially in performance regression analysis where the current solution struggles and a view of more than a single Flamegraph is required to compare different runs.
