Description: 
	High availability is the holy grail of an architect, ensuring the system’s uptime is achieved for a higher than normal period. This can be achieved with an Active-Active architecture and Active-Passive architecture, which, in turn, can be deployed using different models, eg multi-site clustering and cross datacenter replication. The performance is monitored to ensure the system is meeting the agreed upon SLAs and SLOs.
Let’s understand all those terms, the relationships between them and how to implement those.
