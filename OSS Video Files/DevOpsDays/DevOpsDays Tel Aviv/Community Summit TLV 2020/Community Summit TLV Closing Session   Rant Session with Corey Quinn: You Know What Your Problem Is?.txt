00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,079
event

other way around there we go oh there we

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,160
go

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,120
right so just to take a moment and uh

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,960
kind of

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
let people know how we got to the idea

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,960
of this event

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,399
so uh originally i wanted to have a

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,960
round session where people would just

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,119
come up and drunkenly complain

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,119
and then tron said i know just the

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,040
person

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,200
and then how that's how we got you and

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,760
then we decided to make it challenging

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,479
and have people have you rant on demand

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,479
that is by the way a new aws service

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,119
um i can only imagine what the billing

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,479
model must look like

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,080
definitely so take it away corey sure

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,159
thanks for having me it's always great

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,640
to wind up having an evening uh after

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,079
party drunken thing at local times 7 30

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,840
in the morning which means i'm three

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,600
drinks in already because i have tiny

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,479
humans running around uh one of them's

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,240
two months old

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,600
which means that sleep is a luxury i

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,360
don't get to have this year

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,880
kind of like you know gathering and

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,640
meeting with others and having the

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,840
blissful escape of either

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,200
travel sleep or death so it's been an

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,320
interesting year thank you for

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,920
tolerating me

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,360
there have been a few questions i think

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,119
that people dropped in about things

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,880
people want me to rant about but

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,240
you're hosting guild dealer's choice

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,520
where do you want me to start

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,000
ooh i um i had an idea so you know how

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,479
aws snowball is expensive

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,080
i want i i'm thinking of super gluing

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,280
thumb drives to carry your pigeons

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,640
instead

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,160
that could work out well and if you

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,560
think a snowball's expensive wait till

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,640
you try losing one

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,680
for a long time they said that oh you'll

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,879
have to pay

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,440
the lost device fee if you lose it as is

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,680
mentioned

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,560
on our pricing website let me spoil it

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,440
for you

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,040
there was no actual pricing information

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,160
so what it's basically saying is we're

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,200
going to charge you some

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,840
undetermined number and i was very

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,239
interested

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,360
in finding out exactly how much that was

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,519
going to cost

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,800
so i i'm talking to people there and

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,640
there they have some very good

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,959
counterpoints like

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,879
you don't you haven't actually taken a

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,280
snowball yet and you're already asking

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,319
about

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,120
losing one what you do in there

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,280
buddy and like you'll be happier if you

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,080
don't know and their response was oh

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,599
undoubtedly so but tell us anyway cool

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,640
so you have this service called

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,720
ground station and i want to take this

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,640
i want to take a snowball edge and i

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,840
then i want to harden the [ __ ] out of it

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,159
so i can so it's

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
basically can operate in a high

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,120
radiation environment

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,640
at this point people start to get

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
worried with where the hell is he going

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,760
with this

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,519
then i'm going to put it in a launch

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,879
slot on one of the rockets that go up

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,000
from time to time and we're going to

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,159
orbit this thing

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,519
it's going to be the first availability

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,440
zone in space

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,720
then and talk to it with ground station

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,400
and it becomes awesome

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,920
then at the end of the mission whatever

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,560
that looks like we're gonna de-orbit

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,599
that thing

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
onto larry ellison's house now done

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,599
right

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,360
we're gonna have a sponsor logo on the

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,040
side of this thing it's one of the only

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,799
ways that you're pretty clearly going to

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,799
be able to get your logo on the front

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,760
page of the new york times

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,920
you don't want to know what i'm going to

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,080
charge you to do that but you know dream

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,080
big and their response was yeah

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,799
absolutely right i was much happier not

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,519
knowing that

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,519
and here we are

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,560
makes sense i was actually when you said

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,840
radiation i thought about chernobyl

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
maybe you know like that that could

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
actually work potentially fukushima is

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,000
also having

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,840
some of those areas as well but the

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,599
problem is is that the fukushima reactor

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,840
is in japan which is you know

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,639
well-run as opposed to yeah

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,959
yeah yeah it's been an experience

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,079
and honestly going places that are

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,639
likely to kill me

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
just by the ambient environment is not

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,759
my uh

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,400
is not generally how i prefer to operate

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,919
i prefer

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,919
they were the leading threat to my

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,479
health is my own smart mouth running

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,479
away from me

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,960
pandemic it's really hard though not

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
impossible to punch me in the face over

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,080
the internet

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,160
okay next one so covet is almost a year

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,960
old now yeah i really campaign continue

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,600
yeah but so how can we proper celebrate

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,600
its birthday

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,600
that's a really good question um you

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,759
gotta have oracle involved somehow

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,440
because of course

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,039
licensing fees are going to be a bit

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,400
steep uh if

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,160
other thing i think you really take a

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,720
look at the best parts of covet and

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
again

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,240
you can find a silver lining in just

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,400
about anything

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,280
like if you have your uh like when you

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
have like

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,039
the relatives you can't stand for the

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,600
holiday gathering you can turn down the

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,919
speaker

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,039
and then just nod sagely i mean those

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,120
relatives are awful

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,880
because they're they never stop talking

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,440
long enough to ask a question so as long

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,840
as you can

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,600
loop a smiling and nodding video you can

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,880
go back and get back to your life

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,120
that's one of the that's one of the good

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,120
things about it but as far as how to

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,120
celebrate its birthday

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,800
that's a good one i don't actually have

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,000
a great answer for that yet but now i've

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,000
got to stop thinking about

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,440
it the part of the problem here is at

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,639
least in you know i'm in the united

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,320
states which has

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,000
uh a couple of good points to it and

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,120
then some other things too

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,560
and it's weird because depending on

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,759
where you live and who you talk to it's

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,240
like i haven't left the house since

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,320
march

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,080
uh the hair not being in my face is all

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,199
special effects known as hair ties you

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,280
know they sell those

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,960
but other people i talk to like my

00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
distant family if they haven't died yet

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,919
from this

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,000
have basically been oh it's just it's

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,479
just like the flu don't worry about it

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,319
and it's

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,479
if i'm the last person quarantining i

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,080
really wish someone would tell me

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,479
it's becoming a weird thing makes sense

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,600
you still you at least have amazon prime

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,360
i do and in fact

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,199
here in san francisco it's a major city

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,280
so we wind up getting a lot of the early

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,960
uh the early access to stuff like

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,360
they do alcohol delivery which is

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,520
awesome and they have amazon prime now

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,919
for pets uh amazon prime meow

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,639
and that tends to work out rather well

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,319
and

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,240
it's interesting seeing the weird

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,199
experiments that they launch in markets

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,160
like this

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,000
it's it's disturbing on some level where

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,919
they're toying with oh we can wind up

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,639
delivering a subset of things in two

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,880
hours but

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,440
we're really sorry for that we're trying

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,520
to get it down to one hour

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,639
at what point is this going to be where

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,319
okay

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,840
you ordered something and we just we

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,199
just have like a warehouse truck around

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,199
the corner that's parked

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,639
and the person running is a big

00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,759
slingshot where they're going to just

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,919
hurl packages

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,520
through a plate glass window and

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,039
basically oh it's in my living room

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,479
it's so nice to get something like you

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,919
know a set of headphones instead of the

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,599
usual suspects which is

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,599
a brick with a threatening note tied to

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,560
it but it's also written in the amazon

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:19,520
font so one wonders

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:23,199
that yeah interesting point

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,400
uh one person here maish is asking for

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,440
uh for uh advice on how to develop his

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,000
infrastructure

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,360
he's asking cloud formation versus cdk

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,639
versus terraform

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,599
cool well the first thing you have to

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,360
ask yourself when you're trying to

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,960
figure out between these things is what

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
do i want my resume to say

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
let's not kid ourselves it's easy to say

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,039
that oh that's a joke no one actually

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,120
does resume driven development yeah

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,800
how naive are you of course everything

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,319
we do is driven by resume driven

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
development my god if you want the

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,400
website to stay

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,000
up in most cases for most loads cool i'm

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,840
gonna pop something at digilotion or

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,080
whatnot and that'll be fine

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,280
whereas oh no no no we need to go deep

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,759
on microservices kubernetes and uh oh i

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,960
feel like a service mesh now as well you

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,440
know it's it's way

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,160
easier and you have a better production

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,319
outcome

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,720
when you reach the senior engineer

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,319
territory which is where you realize

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,160
i want to have all these words on my

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,720
resume and so i need to figure out how

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,800
these things

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,560
architect together and speak responsibly

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,199
and how i do observability

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,240
and then the senior breakthrough happens

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,120
holy [ __ ]

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,879
i can just lie that's right you can lie

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,280
in your resume those things are never

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,520
fact

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,959
checked but as far as the right

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,640
direction to go in

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,479
between cdk terraform cloud formation

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,240
there's a hierarchy and they're jostling

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,000
for how you want to manage this

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,720
but the ultimate level beyond that is

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,440
what we all do which is using the aws

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,160
console

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,480
and then lying about it and saying it's

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,880
done

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,920
in either the cdk or paloomi is sort of

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,839
like the next year down

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,040
then you go back into the older the

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,120
olden days of

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,120
terraform and cloud formation the old

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,560
and olden days of using puppet and chef

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,240
to manage things and then back to the

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,800
beginner mind of clicking around in the

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,440
console

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,080
so you can it all comes back around

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,600
again

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,360
uh at some point i'm looking forward to

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,040
rolling out puppet and or shaft

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,640
not because it's the best practice but

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,720
because it's the classic

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,040
retro way of provisioning infrastructure

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,080
just like grandpa used to do

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,160
definitely uh [ __ ] is asking whether

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,360
you should do go with cloud9 or cloud

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,880
shell

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,080
depends on what you're trying to do if

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,920
you're trying to misuse them as a

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,519
horseshit or sats form of a database

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,399
it's hard to go wrong with either one of

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,560
them

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320
cloud shell was just announced you if on

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,040
per account once they deploy it to all

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,440
regions

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,320
with the limit you get 200 gigabytes of

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,800
free space

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,080
per account which is awesome one gig

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,839
each 10 per region

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,000
20 production commercial regions right

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,080
now so that becomes

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,920
a an awesome way of storing a bunch of

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
crap that you really should find a

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,800
better way to store but that's okay if

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,480
you're here for good advice

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,000
this is the wrong talk the the value of

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
having these things is awesome

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,880
i loved cloud9 which is awesome because

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,959
they launched it as an in-browser ide

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,040
and they acquired it and they launched

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,480
this and this is awesome

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,600
i keep forgetting it's there because for

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,000
the past two years

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,519
so has amazon there haven't been any

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,959
meaningful enhancements to it

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,959
at all and now they launched cloud shell

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,880
this week which is awesome it's an in

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,440
browser in the console there's a shell

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
option

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,640
where it spins up a free container that

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,079
gives you some an

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
area that already is provisioned and i

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,399
do think the service is legitimately

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
awesome

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,480
and i'm looking at this going this is

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,720
great but it's also hauntingly familiar

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,959
because five years and two months ago

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,680
google released this in gcp and it was

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,279
awesome

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,760
and then azure came out with it three

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,279
years ago and then oracle cloud

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,600
came out with it back at the beginning

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,120
of this year and holy crap

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,920
ibm cloud uh the oxymoron of the year

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,959
is came out with this back in june how

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,839
ibm can

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,240
beat aws to market on something like

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,000
this

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,160
is just at some point you have to wonder

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,839
if uh like if they're not exactly here

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,240
for the hunting up in seattle

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,279
it's it's one of those i i just don't

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,519
fully understand

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,640
what would have caused delays like this

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,240
it almost feels like internal

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,959
politicking now let me be fair

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,839
i understand and accept that at aws

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,760
scale

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,079
nothing is simple all of this stuff is

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,120
hard all of this stuff is complicated

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,839
and i am sympathetic to that on balance

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,079
i pay them

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,120
a shitload of money as does pretty much

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,880
everyone and

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,640
that money is not just for them to solve

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,279
the easy fun problems

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,320
it i understand it's hard i'm paying you

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,399
do it anyway

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,399
not to sound like too much of a jerk but

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,880
yeah

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,720
which brings me to another point uh so

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,240
a while ago i wrote a script and it

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,839
didn't work

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,760
so yes i too work with computers

00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:01,040
and and then they had an epiphany

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,760
why do cloud automation instead

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,160
of hiring a click form to drag and drop

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,519
stuff on the aws console

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,360
because you're not thinking hard enough

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,680
on this the right way to do it

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,839
is people like sure your i can hire a

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,320
click farmer just click things randomly

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,279
that's great and but it's it's it's the

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,600
small brain thing

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,800
the right thing to do is if you want a

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,519
service configured

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,200
what you do is you build an iam role so

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,680
it's it allows you to configure this

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,639
thing

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,480
in a test account and then you build a

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,560
user account an iam that has

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,079
access to that role and that's all it

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,560
has access to and you

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,000
accidentally post the credentials for

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,240
that role on github

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,279
and then you wait because as people

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,279
discover this

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,639
they will break into your account and

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,560
configure the service

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,000
for you and ideally find a way to make

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,440
it mine bitcoin because that's basically

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,279
the ultimate the only reason people hack

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,880
into things anymore apparently

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,560
and and by the end of it you just

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,720
capture what they've done oh

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,399
that's how that service gets configured

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,160
awesome then you copy that into your

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:05,200
production account and you're set to go

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,320
robert baron asks what has the cloud

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,320
ever done for us anyway

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,480
it it's about lightening the load it's

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,880
about

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,720
taking burdens that you have and not

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,399
having to carry them anymore

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,399
for example in a time before cloud

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,320
remember how heavy our wallets were

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,320
we don't have ability problems anymore

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,320
it's about being able to

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,760
throw things over the wall to someone

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
else and

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,440
again i'm okay with that in some respect

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,959
but the thing that always pisses me off

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,519
is the data breach announcements

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,600
where some big company says oh some

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,160
terrible vendor that we used

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,480
uh wound up uh one of exposing your data

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,680
and getting breached it's like

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,360
cool who hired that vendor [ __ ] it's

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,279
it you can outsource work you can't

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,040
outsource responsibility you own your

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,040
own uptime regardless

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,320
and a lot of people say oh the cloud

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,760
went down that's awful

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,440
that's why you should always remain on

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,480
data centers yeah i used to run data

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,240
centers

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,399
they went down a lot more than the cloud

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,079
did and it wasn't because i was crappy

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,120
at my job that was just an ancillary

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,959
aspect

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,720
the honest fact is that you're not going

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,880
to be you're not going to be better

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,639
at running data data centers than these

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,920
giant providers are

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,160
they're computers they're terrible

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,320
little things and they hate us so

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,600
having someone who is better at

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,920
wrangling those things and

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,720
has more budget than you do to do that

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,880
spoiler

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,959
all the hyperscalers have more budget

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,920
than you do to run these farms unless

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,440
you're basically

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,040
facebook but enough about terrible

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,720
companies no one likes

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:39,199
what else can i answer okay oh uh julia

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,480
asked why is everything on aws elastic

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,560
and uh and this is one of those

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,839
questions this is one of those questions

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,279
that i'm really sorry that we have a

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,079
code of conduct

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,000
oh it's not a lot they just say it's

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,360
elastic because like oh that's the value

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,800
proposition of cloud

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,639
so that when you get a whole bunch of

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,440
traffic you can scale up your

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,519
environment

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,959
and that and and meet that surge which

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,720
is true and it's great

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,120
and then at the end of it you can scale

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,920
it back down which no one actually ever

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,760
does it's when they talk about elastic

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,160
volume side resizing yeah

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,000
that's up not down and in fairness when

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,639
you talk about scaling volumes down

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,880
an awful lot of file systems just melt

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,959
themselves to bits when you try and

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,560
make the volume smaller online which

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,880
okay cool i get that

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,160
but auto scaling groups they scale up

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,560
and they give you the capacity

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,519
you need 20 minutes after you needed it

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,120
and

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,639
scaling up and pre-provisioning is

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,240
important so people do it

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,800
but they don't go the other direction

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,639
because if i don't scale up i'm dropping

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,120
traffic and now tcp terminates on the

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,199
floor if i fail to scale down

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,040
then well my only real failure mode is

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,600
that i just spend a little bit of extra

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,759
money and let's not kid ourselves here

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,839
it's not our money it's our employer's

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,199
money uh that joke used to land a lot

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,199
better with me until i own my own

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,040
company and then it was oh

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,800
wait that's just my other pocket never

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,800
mind

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,160
uh julia complains that she did not

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,720
answer her question

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,920
ah okay why is everything elastic was

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,079
the question that i heard

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,959
because naming is hard and that's why

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,639
aws just gave up on it years ago

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,480
uh do they use the same excuse for the

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,639
billing method

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,240
uh their billing method no uh that's not

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,639
that's that's not elasticity

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,680
and again bad names aren't gonna let you

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,759
overcharge customers

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,600
so what instead they do with billing is

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,160
you know what this thing needs

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,880
more complexity that's right the the

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,720
problem is

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,040
is you need to be able to look at a

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,519
service and figure out okay

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,079
if someone has this much traffic how

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,199
much

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,240
should it should they be able to should

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,959
be charged at the end of the month for

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,320
this

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,800
and if you can come up with an answer

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,199
you haven't succeeded yet and it has to

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,759
be

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,600
a the the suck it and see method which

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,199
is not as profane as it sounds

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,040
back in the days of data centers that

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,320
was how you would find out if a power

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,000
cable was live

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,240
uh suck on the end of it and if you're

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,480
blown backwards through a rack

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,279
it winds up basically like okay that's

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,040
how you learn

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,880
by doing the painful thing and living

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,559
through the experience i'm kidding we

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,160
didn't actually do that in data centers

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,760
that is super dangerous

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,760
we had an apprentice do it instead

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,240
okay um and we'll show

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:21,280
asks about the new aws service names

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,160
specifically aws systems manager

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,160
application manager or systems manager

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,439
change manager or systems manager fleet

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,840
manager to join

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,919
systems manager session manager you have

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,919
all of these different manager services

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,000
reporting up to systems manager

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,679
which has not been promoted to systems

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,360
director because it's clearly basically

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,080
a woman in tech at this point

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,480
but yeah it's a terrible naming scheme

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,320
of

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,480
something manager something manager

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,320
because apparently they haven't hired a

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
systems manager marketing manager who

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,600
would

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,960
actually name things well it's this is

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,200
the problem is that

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,360
systems manager as a service is awesome

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,799
i love the service it offers a lot of

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
really neat things and it's gaining

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,320
additional functionality

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,160
and the problem is that they look at

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,000
what they have built and they saw

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,480
that it was good and they're like all

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,080
right how do i really ruin everyone's

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,679
day with this because the service is so

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,480
good there has to be something awful

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,679
about it

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,640
yo aws namers what can you do for me and

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,960
it's great

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,320
and it's uh hang on i need to go walk my

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,320
dog again it's wet

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,679
wait what the hell did you name the dog

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,280
and you really don't want the

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,960
answer to that question it winds up

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,240
being something like simple elastic bark

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,080
and fluff 2.0

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,640
for containers uh mace asks

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,760
why do you only rant about aws why no

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,919
love for azure

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,039
gcp alicloud ibm oh uh honestly because

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,720
i i enjoy

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,200
ranting at uh about things that actually

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,480
have paying customers

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,559
my day job i fix horrifying aws bills

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,240
and i went where the big bills are and

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,240
for a long time now it's one of those

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,400
hey while you're looking at i don't know

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,799
our 20 million dollar annual aws bill

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,880
can you also fix our gcp bill

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,039
cool how much is it oh about 50 grand

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
yeah uh how about we fix like i can i

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,919
can wind up saving you that much money

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400
on your load balancing portion of your

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,039
aws bill this is a radical concept for

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,640
some but

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,400
why don't we start with the big numbers

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,799
and work our way down and when we get to

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,960
gcp we'll have that conversation then

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,919
same story with azure now this is not a

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,400
global truth

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,400
it it is very much the customers that i

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,720
deal with in the circles in which i run

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,720
aws also for some god forsaken reason

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,840
had a five-year uncontested head start

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,679
in the time of cloud

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,919
so a lot of the small companies were

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,520
experimenting with this in 2008 or so

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,240
are now the giant companies and have

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,679
those presences there uh cloud

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,039
migrations are kind of a myth in some

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,480
respect they're an incredible amount of

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,280
work with unclear gains

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,280
so if you are building out on aws and

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,600
amazon has pissed me off for

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,039
a reason and there's oh there's 6 000

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,880
good reasons you can pick for that

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,480
it doesn't matter which one we're going

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,080
to move off of them

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,679
well that's 18 months of work in most

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,240
cases and it's expensive engineering

00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,760
work

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,520
and you have to learn the ins and outs

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,799
of a new different platform

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,880
what's the business outcome at the end

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,880
of that and if the answer is no

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,480
seems like a good idea to me it yeah

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,159
just because amazon has pissed you off

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,280
is not a sufficient reason to do that

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,880
in most cases so the idea that oh i'm

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,559
going to pick a bunch of cloud agnostic

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,600
technologies that are not tied to any

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,760
particular provider

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,520
so i can move it anywhere if i want to

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,960
makes you feel way better about never

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,000
doing exactly that

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,000
so what have you gained

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,960
pretty much nothing and i see this

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,240
coming up all the time

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,799
alex asks can we say running on bare

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,320
metal is cool yet

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,000
sure because at this point it's hipster

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,360
it's one of those oh yeah i know what

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,559
the data center looks like

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,240
it's it's one of those areas where

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,080
every once in a while back in the before

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,480
times when i would give a talk on stage

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,760
i would work a slide of rack nuts the

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,440
things that you would use to mount

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,559
servers into racks and we've all bled

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,520
for them because they cut your hands and

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,120
hurts like hell

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,440
and then i just i'm very careful when i

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,840
change that slide to watch the audience

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,840
and sort of measure the proportion of

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,200
people who have the flinch reaction of

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,960
ah because they remember and it hurt

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,480
block it out i'm told childbirth is

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,400
somewhat similar except when you see the

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,600
rack nuts it comes crashing back in a

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,840
whole different way

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,520
and that proportion of the audience has

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,520
been getting smaller

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,280
as time goes on either people are

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,280
learning to control their flinch reflex

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,440
unlikely or there's an increasing

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,000
constituency of folks who have

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,880
not worked in data centers this is from

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,919
my perspective

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,120
a very good thing where i like seeing

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,159
people who are new to the industry

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,000
getting into these things

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,240
i like throwing gates open and bringing

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,360
people in like come work on cloud be

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,480
miserable with us

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,520
it's great and it's it's one of those

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,120
like i feel like at some point i'm

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,080
trying to convince people to try drugs

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,640
just once just

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,440
just see how you like it it yeah the

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,880
problem is

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,400
that's not a really fair comparison

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,480
because i'm trying to get people hooked

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,159
on drugs i'm presumably making a profit

00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,200
here i'm just spreading misery around

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,400
uh alex asked about uh career

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,600
development

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,600
uh i think it's a good idea

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,760
uh management is it the promotion

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,640
neither is moving

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,919
to another company management is

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,880
absolutely not a promotion it's an

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,280
orthogonal role

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,880
that is the honest truth of it the

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,240
counterpoint is yeah look around most

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,760
companies and see who makes more the

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,640
manager or the engineers

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,400
and well why is that some people think

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,080
there's a hierarchy personally i think

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
that it's because dealing with people's

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,679
[ __ ]

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,919
is a lot harder than dealing with

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,799
computers in some ways because

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,360
here's the thing i can run the same

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,039
thing

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,559
through a computer repeatedly and get

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,240
deterministic output

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,559
unless it's running an intel chip

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,799
whereas i can with people

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,760
what works on you doesn't work on

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,919
someone else

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,200
and everyone's different and even at

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,440
different weeks people have different

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,360
reactions to it and it can be maddening

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,440
and it's a completely different skill

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,440
set now so the honest thing is

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,840
not when you look at your career it's

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,039
well i need to show a progression

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,640
companies that know what they're doing

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,320
offer a technical contributor path that

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,559
doesn't require managing people

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,240
you have to be very honest with yourself

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,760
of what are you going for here

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,039
is this about your own development as a

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,520
as a person and what you want to be

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,320
doing life is long and our careers are

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,400
long too

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,600
and i think that it's i don't want to

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,000
spend that long time

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,640
miserable in ways that don't appeal to

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,520
me i'd rather

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,799
have find forms of misery that do i for

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,960
example don't

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,919
particularly enjoy managing people at

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,919
the moment because

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,760
there are aspects of it i really like

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,440
but it's also maddening in different

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,720
ways so i mostly wind up

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,640
passing that stuff off to my business

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,640
partner he manages the staff

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,640
i basically go make a fool of myself and

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,279
then use like this as a primary job

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,799
that's right

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,880
find something you're good at and enjoy

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,480
in my case [ __ ] posting and find a way

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,400
to build a job out of that

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,720
and sometimes the path to what those

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,760
things you want to do absolutely is

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,440
about uh about pro about uh management

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,120
sometimes it's not the second half of

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,080
that question is about changing jobs is

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,720
that changing companies

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,159
is that a promotion maybe maybe not it

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,600
should definitely be a raise and it's

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,159
something that people should do way too

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
often

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,200
what you don't want to do is look at the

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,559
last 10 years of your career and find

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,159
that you have one year of experience you

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,679
repeated 10 times

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,520
unless that's what you're going for in

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,799
which case fine i'm not one to judge but

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,440
it would drive me nuts

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,960
so i like finding new and exciting ways

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,600
to learn new things and keep moving

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,080
forward

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,960
if i were still having the same problems

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,559
of

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,640
that i was having 10 years ago like how

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,400
do i get the blood to stop flowing when

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,960
i just cut myself to pieces on the rack

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,799
nuts

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,480
i i would be super depressed and also

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,039
heavily calloused by this point

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,720
so it's it comes down to what is the

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,240
problem you're trying to solve for

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,559
for me it's always been about finding

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,559
new challenges and exactly how far can i

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,600
go to pissing large companies off before

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,159
they either kill me

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,440
or send me a cease and desist we're

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,520
still trying to find the boundaries of

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,480
that

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,080
uh we only have time for one more and i

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,240
saved this one for last cory

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,320
okay only because i really really love

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,760
you excellent uh

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,760
why is cloud building so hard

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,559
because if you knew what it was going to

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,840
cost in advance no one would pay it

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,360
it's in all seriousness i when i first

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,400
started this it's one of these

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,080
why is this billing system so awful and

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,360
then i made some friends well

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,120
friends is kind of a lofty term for

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,720
people who barely tolerate me but

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,559
i've got to know some people who work on

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,400
the billing system at

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,919
these environments and i talked about

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,039
the constraints that they labor under

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,600
and how this works

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,640
the billing the billing system at aws

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,279
and they've been public about this in

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,360
blog post

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,960
takes in over a petabyte of raw data per

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,440
day it is

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,039
monstrously large and complicated and

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,679
rendering that down in a repeatable

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,120
fashion

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,640
is hard it's super hard because it turns

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,440
out that the world is full of people

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,159
like me

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,480
you know [ __ ] and when you are

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,559
there's

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,480
if there's a edge case for me to get

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,919
free services and exploit that

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,600
that's a problem they have to capture

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,679
the dimension that i will be exploiting

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,640
when it was in beta s3 did not charge

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,200
per request

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,559
just for storage cool so you wound up

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,360
with a bunch of people like me

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,679
again [ __ ] who would build these

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,919
enormous arrays of zero byte objects

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,600
and use the metadata uh to actually

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,279
store the things they cared about

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,799
the big key value store that's right

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,720
they made it a database

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,919
misusing things as databases is kind of

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,640
my entire stick

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,640
and like oh yeah how do we prevent that

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,159
because at some point it incurs a

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,840
sizable cost

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,440
for which they are capturing zero

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,799
dollars and it's the answer is cool

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,640
we're gonna charge i think what is it a

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,600
penny for every thousand requests or

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,679
something like that

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,600
so for most common use cases if you have

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,760
saw any sizeable storage at all

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,360
that's sort of a who cares story there

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,840
are some very weird very broken use

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,919
cases

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,600
that really can hit you and evaluate if

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,039
maybe you're not using the tool properly

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,799
or the wrong tool

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,400
but there's a whole bunch of stories

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,640
like that

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,400
and every time i ask the question of why

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,840
is this billing aspect so

00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:01,120
wonky the answer has never once

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,720
been holy [ __ ] we never thought of that

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,480
the answer is always it's complicated

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,320
do you have a whiteboard handy let me

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,480
explain the constraints here

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,679
and every time i come away smarter and

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,360
honestly a little bit more

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,120
respectful toward what the internals of

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,080
the billing system i have

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,559
a lot of sympathy for it but consumption

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,320
based

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:25,279
pricing as a thing is not predictable

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,880
full stop now you can do there are ways

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,640
around that you can do modeling you can

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,159
do standard deviation calculations to

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,840
figure out what is the likelihood you

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,240
can do scenario modeling as well

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,600
but there is no provable way in advance

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,159
to figure out what something is going to

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,279
cost

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,000
when you're paying for consumption and

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,440
then

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,120
[ __ ] running forever by accident doesn't

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,000
help either

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,799
i did that once uh yeah it's still

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
running today

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,440
i'll turn this thing i'll turn this

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,720
instance off in a week and meanwhile

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,760
you're going to retire before that thing

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,200
does

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,679
oh definitely yeah anyway

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,840
i we would like to announce the the

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,279
three our three favorite questions

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,120
excellent uh uh first uh the one year

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,720
birthday of covid that's natalie

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,159
pistonovich that was a good question i

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,039
wish i had a better answer

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,039
yeah uh the second one is uh moshe

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,880
benjamin with aws naming

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,799
i know that's difficult but that's a

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,919
classic it's kind of a giveaway on the

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,039
other hand was good

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,279
i don't know and the third one uh

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,720
and my personal favorite was everything

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,520
elastic by julia

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,520
and mostly because it spawned uh it

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,120
spawned several non-safer work threats

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,080
that go on in the background

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,720
excellent excellent good be good so

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,200
corey

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:42,640
uh we are so happy to have you again

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,320
delightful gil i love you man you just

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,399
keep ignoring me on twitter

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,730
exactly oh i blocked years ago are you

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,960
kidding me

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,679
[Laughter]

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,200
sure i'll go cry in the corner yeah

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,640
seriously thank you

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,000
if you enjoy my life the one and only

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,559
the one and only corey

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,600
thank you so much for cracking up the

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,600
whole time

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,039
i'm shilling here just a second if

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,080
you're enjoying if you're my nonsense

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,240
please check me out at last week in

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,720
aws.com

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,320
where somehow probably i get paid to

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,320
make fun of amazon for a living

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,480
one thing i would like to say is while

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,720
cory keeps it fun

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,559
and funny there are a lot of jewels of

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,520
wisdom and the things that he says that

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,799
he like kind of

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,200
sews in there because he doesn't want to

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,840
be taken too seriously but dude

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,440
has wisdom due to his wisdom so we're

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,880
very impressed

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,240
for some of my other nonsense as well

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,760
like someone was asking i just noticed

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,279
like why are there the wrong number of

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,159
candles on the menorah

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,919
and it's uh there's the honest answer of

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,960
freaking going uh designers

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,440
but the honest answer

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,399
are not enough candles it's not enough

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,480
the answer is

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,840
i got it at a discount whereas if it's

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,840
too many candles

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
redundancy

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,840
i like those deep answers they have all

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,159
that knowledge and

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,919
it's almost as deep as you know as the

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,919
pockets of people who work for aws

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
uh

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,159
it's two pizza teams and at least we

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,799
like to assume at least one of those

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,520
pizzas

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,520
might be kosher

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,080
i think that's the perfect way to wrap

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,600
this up thank you so much

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,919
