Description: 
	This talk was given in Hebrew.

The system is slowing down, the customers are becoming frustrated, but our monitoring shows all green. Everyone handles performance issues, but how do we measure it properly? Are you really measuring what your users experience? Is it possible to measure everything? In my presentation, I will walk you through some of the blind spots we all have in our monitoring systems, and share from my own experience of dealing with performance issues.
