Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	For the past few years, together with Ran Locar, we're running a side project to find sensitive data exposed by governments and large corporations. Although the code is usually OK from a security POV, in many cases the OPSEC is so bad it makes the effort invested in developing good code - redundant. In this talk we'll cover a few cases unearthed by our project, explore the failures, and discuss ways to prevent such catastrophes from happening on your systems.
