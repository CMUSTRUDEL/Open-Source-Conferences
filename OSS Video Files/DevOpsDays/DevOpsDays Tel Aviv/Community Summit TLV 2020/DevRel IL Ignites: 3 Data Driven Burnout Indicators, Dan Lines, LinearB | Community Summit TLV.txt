Title: DevRel IL Ignites: 3 Data Driven Burnout Indicators, Dan Lines, LinearB | Community Summit TLV
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Burnout is dangerous. Even more so when we can’t see the physical indicators due to being a distributed team. In this lighting talk I discuss the 3 data-driven burnout indicators I use to make sure my team rested and happy. As a manager it’s your responsibility to identify employee burnout and make sure your dev team is rested and healthy. But identifying signs of burnout as a distributed team can be challenging. In this lightning talk I discuss the 3 data-driven burnout indicators I use to make sure my team rested and happy.

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,039
next one up

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,600
which is uh then lines with three data

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:31,840
driven

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:31,840
burnout indicators and let's bring it up

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,360
hey what's up everyone welcome to my

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,360
ignite talk on three

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,559
data driven developer burnout indicators

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,920
i'm dan lyons and i am living

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,800
in southern california outside of la

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,960
i just had my first baby girl daughter

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,680
who's seven months old now

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,879
i'm the host of the dev interrupted

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,440
podcast

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,800
and i'm totally obsessed with dev team

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,199
culture

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,560
and probably most importantly i'm the

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,240
co-founder

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,000
at linear b and all of the data-driven

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,119
burnout indicators that i'm going

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
to talk about today you can actually get

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,240
from our linear b

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
solution the first indicator that's

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,159
super

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,040
important to understand from your

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,720
development team is work in progress or

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,360
width

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,079
this can be tracked in two different

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,479
ways

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,840
one is how many bridges is the

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,280
individual working on

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,640
in parallel in this case sven has 12

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
branches that their work

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,399
he's working on in parallel which is way

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,680
too much

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,439
usually you only want five to six or you

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,759
can also track this from an issue

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,759
perspective like how many stories or

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,000
bugs are being worked on by each person

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,360
in

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,040
parallel if you're in a situation

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,560
where you see that one of your

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,960
developers has you know

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,840
12 branches that are being worked on in

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,439
parallel

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,160
it's a good chance for you to go in and

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,640
redistribute that work to other members

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,640
of the team

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,200
the second indicator that's very

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,440
important to track

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:27,760
especially in the

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,760
these covet times where a lot of this us

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,280
are working from home there's not as

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,680
much

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,680
of a distinction between work life and

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,959
homelessness

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,920
apologies for the uh issues we're having

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,120
some issues there

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,840
just a second let's try and uh get that

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,480
back on

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,239
if not then we have to skip this one

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,599
again apologies for this

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,480
consecutive days work so in this

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,879
situation

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,440
again we're seeing sven is way

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,519
overworked and probably burning out with

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,720
seven out of seven days active which

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,840
means he's been working

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,640
over the weekend in that situation it's

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,440
a great

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,840
chance to reach out to sven and say hey

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,239
man

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
what's going on with the weekend work i

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,920
noticed that you've been working

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,400
you know every single day this week and

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,239
including uh the weekend

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,840
and i just want to understand what type

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,920
of work is going on there do you have

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,920
too much on your plate or is it due to

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,239
you know production fires

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,720
uh let me know what's going on there and

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,200
let's come to a solution together

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,599
the third indicator is what i like to

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,360
call focus factor which is which is a

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,560
metric that kind of tracks

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,760
context switching you'll see in the

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,680
screenshot below

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,000
on the left hand side these are all the

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,879
issues that you might be storing in

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,360
jira for example they could be stories

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,360
they could be bugs they could be tasks

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,879
and on the right hand side where you see

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,959
those bubbles and those

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,360
uh arrows going up and down those are

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,079
actually get comments or pull requests

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,280
or pr

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,320
reviews and you'll see here again

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,040
with sven he's all over the place

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,840
he's working on many uh different

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,720
stories

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,520
in parallel from day to day and this is

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,639
a huge

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,680
indicator that he is not focused and

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,800
when developers

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,600
aren't focused it leads to more burnout

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,000
so again this is a great situation to

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,280
have a conversation with this person

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,199
and rebalance the workload redistribute

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,440
the workload to other members of the

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,440
team

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,400
if you want to find out more about

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,680
