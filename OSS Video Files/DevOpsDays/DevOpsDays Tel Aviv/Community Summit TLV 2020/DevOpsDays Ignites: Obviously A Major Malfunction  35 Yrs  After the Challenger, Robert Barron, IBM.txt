[Music]

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,279
so next coming up

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,960
is a robert darren from ibm so robert is

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,519
the aiops lead

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,680
and he's going to to talk about uh

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
super interesting challenges and

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,840
disasters

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,840
so robert take it away

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,399
robert i think you are on mute okay

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,040
thank you okay

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,920
so hello everyone my name is robert

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,760
barron uh

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,760
day today i work at ibm helping clients

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,800
with their site reliability engineering

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,800
needs but

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,480
what i really like is thinking about the

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,079
past space exploration

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,239
and all the lessons we can learn from

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
the heroes who brought us to the moon

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,280
took us into space and what i want to

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,640
share with you today

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,760
is just one part of one of these lessons

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,400
so taking you back to 1986

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,520
25 years of manned space flight success

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,680
for nasa

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,439
first american in space first man on the

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,520
moon the space shuttle

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,479
so many great things they did and that

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,920
they were just going

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,920
from strength to strength

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,640
challenger mission sts-51l was supposed

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,400
to be a very special mission because it

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
would be the first time that a regular

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,439
person

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
was going to fly into space a teacher

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,280
not a trained astronaut

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,799
would go into space and give lessons to

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,360
the whole world

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,200
from space and the mission started off

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,400
unfortunately on the left foot because

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,720
the schedule

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
well the schedule was not good it kept

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,000
on being delayed

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,320
again and again and again until it was

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,759
finally scheduled for january

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,520
1986 which happened to be the coldest

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,280
launch ever there was going to be

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,920
launching at zero degrees

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,960
celsius absolutely freezing and many of

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,880
the engineers

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,240
tried to stop the launch to tell

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,680
management that no

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,000
it was not safe to launch unfortunately

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,800
they could not convince management

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,599
that the launch was unsafe launch

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
happened

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,680
as planned after the fifth delay but

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,200
73 seconds after launch unfortunately

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,599
tragically

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,000
the space shuttle disintegrated in

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,000
flight and all seven lives were lost

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,599
during the post-mortem and analysis of

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,440
the problem what the engineers

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,319
discovered was that within the side

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,400
rockets

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,480
there are oilings rings of rubber that

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,599
are designed to insulate

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,920
the rocket and insulate the heat

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,840
that forms inside and because of the

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,760
cold these

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,959
these rings became brittle and as you

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,360
can see a flame

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,040
erupted from the side of the rocket it

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,080
struck

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,879
the fuel tank over here breaking a hole

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
into it

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,400
and causing it to explode disintegrating

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,760
the rest of the

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,599
of the shuttle so when finding out why

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,519
did this happen how does this happen

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,920
it's very easy to imagine that the

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,000
problem was a senior manager just

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,200
shouting at the engineers we've delayed

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,840
too much launch

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,680
now i don't care about your problems and

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,000
while there is some truth in this

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,599
it's not that simple because the

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,760
engineers when they presented the

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,319
problems to the manatee management

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,040
did not actually convince them that the

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,080
problem was

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,879
cold and i'm oversimplifying

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,280
greatly but if you take this graph which

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,360
shows

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,760
us the temperature at launch and the

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,519
damage to o-rings from previous flights

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,480
you can see that yes there is some

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,799
damage but

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,599
nothing bad happened to as a result of

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,519
this damage

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,440
and you can't really show that it's

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,440
because of the cold

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
so the engineers were then told to prove

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,400
that there's a problem

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,239
and they could not really prove that the

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,040
launch was unsafe so the launch went

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,640
through

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,239
but let's look at another way of

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,000
examining this information

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,760
these are the flights that have damage

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,640
if we add other flights that did not

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,480
have damage

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,080
we can see that there is a correlation

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
between temperature the higher the

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,879
temperature

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,959
most likely less damage and if we add

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,560
the projection for what will happen the

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,639
challenge of light

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,720
well we can see that the challenger

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,600
launched at a much higher temperature

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,400
which was a much greater cause uh for

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,160
concern

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,160
unfortunately all this information is

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,120
only obvious in hindsight

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,240
because during the analysis of the of

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,759
the flight

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,919
nasa suffered from something called

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,680
normalization of deviance

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,160
what does that mean that means that in

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,080
previous flights there had been damage

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,280
to the o-rings it's not desirable to

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,000
have damage but

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,600
it's not dangerous shuttles often launch

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,479
late and we have to have pressure to

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,800
launch on time

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,720
and we've gotten away with it this all

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,160
meant that they moved from a couch of

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,560
proof that it's safe

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
to a culture of proof it's unsafe and

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,360
it's much more difficult to prove that

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,160
something

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,800
you know is unsafe so they ended up in a

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,479
case where

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
technical debt the problems that they

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,800
had collected were less important

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
than making sure that the less the next

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,720
mission was launched

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,560
or in our case deploying the next

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,759
version

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,240
so in summary manage your risk never

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,720
normalize deviance never allow

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,639
something bad that doesn't have negative

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,400
actions to allow you to think that

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,720
everything is going to be fine

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,479
remember the clue of challenger many of

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,440
the lessons that we get from them

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,560
uh will help us today i have many other

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,479
lessons available

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,080
most of them with happier stories from

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,560
the successful moon landings that we

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,800
have

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,759
here are a couple of links to them and

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,960
thank you very much

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,160
i hope you enjoyed this session

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,199
and the rest of of the conference

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,520
thank you very much robert definitely

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,639
definitely and definitely we should be

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,639
looking

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,680
on information before going live and

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,160
before

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,880
moving systems to production so thank

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,880
you very much

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,240
