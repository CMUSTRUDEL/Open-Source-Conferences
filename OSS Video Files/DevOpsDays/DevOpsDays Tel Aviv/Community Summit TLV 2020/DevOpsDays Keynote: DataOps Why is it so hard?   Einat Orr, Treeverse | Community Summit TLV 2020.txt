Description: 
	DataOps is harder than you might think. Supporting the operations of big data environments poses a challenge greater than the known application-level support due to the complexity of managing data together with the application. Why is data adding so much complexity? Well, Data is big, so all systems are now becoming distributed. Data is mutable, and it's hard to create repeatable, automated pipelines. On top of that, the technology is evolving at high speed and change management is messy. In this talk, we will dive into those challenges, explore best practices, and develop empathy for those who manage big data environments.
