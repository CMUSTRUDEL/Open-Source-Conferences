Title: DevSecCon Ignites: [HEB] When DevOps Fails Miserably, Yaniv Simsolo, RTL | Community Summit TLV
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	This talk was given in Hebrew.

In this presentation I will briefly present some insights on the soft belly of DevOps. Even when SecDevOps is used, there are additional factors that should be understood for having a DevOps system or a DevOps operation secure. Some of the insights that I gain in the past years and most recently as the security manager of a major media company:

SecDevOps requires more people – security architects and security experts.
Juniors will not cut it.
Operational security experts will not do.
Refer to OWASP IL by me: Should I Trust my Vendor
Knowledge Gap – a very nefarious serial killer of DevOps, destroyer of security operations
Ludicrous security tools – some tools are no good. In some ecosystems the best of breed tools is useless.
Testbenching the 2 best of breed tools, mano-a-mano.
