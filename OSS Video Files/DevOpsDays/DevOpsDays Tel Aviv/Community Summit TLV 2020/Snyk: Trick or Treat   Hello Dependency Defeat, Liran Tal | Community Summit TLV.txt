Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Hello there dear developer building your app on open source dependencies. Did you ever wonder where dependencies go when they die? Oh wait, did you think source code lives forever? Think again! Join me on a journey full of humor and scare across real world incidents to learn how even the mightiest of open source projects got defeated.

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,359
so

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,400
hello there let me add master luan

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,960
welcome to the creator

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,840
stage we are so happy to have you with

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,040
us

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,719
um so yeah first of all i wasn't even

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,640
supposed to be unseeing today but i got

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,399
the distinct pleasure to emcee this very

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
last session and it happens to be with

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,879
you so i couldn't be more pleased

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,320
um so first off thanks to snick uh for

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,239
sponsoring the event and for

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,680
leading the devsecond community you

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,079
folks are doing wonderful work there

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,960
tell me a little bit about um snake and

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,440
uh

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,079
and in the the second community in

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,640
general and a little bit about your talk

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,559
cool well uh sneak is all about being a

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
platform for developers so we try to

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,280
help developers

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,520
uh you know through all the ways that we

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,880
know that they work on uh to make them

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,119
you know very successful

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,799
uh in the way that they resolve security

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,320
issues so it's anything from

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,840
being actionable right getting a pull

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,240
request that you can merge it letting

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,560
you know

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,159
exactly which package you should upgrade

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,520
uh which docker container you should

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,040
move to that has

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,799
less vulnerabilities so this is

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,320
basically a developer first uh

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,360
open source uh platform for developers

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,439
super cool um so i'm gonna let you take

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,720
it away with your uh ignite and then

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,840
we'll have a few more minutes afterwards

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,840
for some chip chat and q

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
a and there you go

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,079
well hey everyone thank you for joining

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,520
me today on this uh trick or treat

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,439
dependency is the fit

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,119
kind of so hello developers you're

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,640
building your application probably on

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,159
open source dependencies

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,960
but did you ever wonder where

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,320
dependencies go to die yes dependencies

00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,600
they die did you think they're living

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,840
forever

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,240
think again join me on this journey

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,560
today i'm going to talk about some scare

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,080
and also humor stories about a real

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,599
world incident that happened with open

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,640
source dependencies some of which you

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,440
probably have heard

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,160
at least once uh that got uh you know

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,400
defeated

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,840
by this uh open source world so let's

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,480
get right at it

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
first one is left back that's right this

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,879
is a story of how a legal action

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,480
taken by a commercial body towards an

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,280
open source developer

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,200
resulted in breaking thousands of

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
projects and their builds around the

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,879
javascript

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,000
and node ecosystems among them were the

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,840
node and babel

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,120
projects themselves and the repositories

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,760
that used it so

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,519
let's put something out there in context

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,040
you probably think that this is your

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,680
typical team right you have mary

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,080
jonathan

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,959
and minader right this is your developer

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,760
team uh

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,720
not not exactly right probably there's

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,040
someone else there's

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,920
azer there he is an open source

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,599
developer

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,599
contributing to your projects through

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,840
his open source dependencies

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,200
so your developer development team is

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,800
just a bit bigger over

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,760
those three people actually you forget

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,159
maybe that you import probably about 90

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
of

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,280
open source code from open source

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
dependencies

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,720
so essentially other is really a part of

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,959
your team like we said

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,440
and specifically for this team because

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,000
he wrote this left pad npm module which

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,040
your

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,400
team uses now here's where things get a

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,280
little bit tricky with open source

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
dependencies

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,480
other actually has this npm package

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,040
another one called kick k-i-k

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,000
but apparently that package is attached

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,239
to

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,560
attracted the attention of lawyers

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,640
representing the instant messaging app

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,599
of the same name hello surprise there we

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,159
go we have it

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,159
now what happens next is maybe a

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,840
surprise maybe not but azer

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,680
obviously got this uh kind of a lawsuit

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
you know in the making uh you know we

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,680
started with an email and so on

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,080
but then as a refuse to rename or

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,959
relinquish control of this npm package

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,360
he has hundreds of other packages there

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,239
so

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,799
what happens next well npm gets involved

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,239
and pm decides to make azure kind of

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,319
remove control of that

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
and so upon facing these lawsuits and

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,519
the npm organization not being able to

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,759
consolidate

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,040
you know between the two sides other and

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,320
this company

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,160
what happened is they did in fact remove

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,360
move the access from other to this

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,120
company and so as an act of protest

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,680
azer un published more than 250 packages

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,320
as a sign as he not wanting to be part

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,440
of this

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,120
of this registry of this game

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,880
unfortunately one of those npm packages

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,240
was this little tiny package called left

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,759
leftpad

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,400
leftpad has more than 200 2.5 million

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,600
downloads a month right this is a 17

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,080
lines of code

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,680
package 17 lines of code package doing

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,160
left padding of strings

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,320
but a lot of projects use it and these

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
fallout young dependencies from the

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,520
registry

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,360
of the npm community causing other

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,039
projects that depend on it

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,039
to fill their builds because this

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,240
package was no longer available again

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,919
projects like node and babel so

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,400
this is this is a story right story

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,639
number one packages go to dice sometimes

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,720
package number two story number two that

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,960
we're gonna end with today as well

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,000
would you be able to depart from a

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,320
successful code

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,199
project if you were a maintainer if it

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,479
meant

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,639
that your contribution actually

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,240
would make the world a better place if

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,880
you would remove it from the world if

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,280
you would

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,080
make the planet a better a better planet

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,680
earth

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,600
and the environmental footprint if you

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,639
removed it well this is the story

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,160
amazingly so that's what the next story

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,600
is going to talk about with a maintainer

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,440
who was brave enough

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,039
to basically put his success on the

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,479
sidelines if it

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,520
meant a greener world let's see in two

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,919
in 2011 francois releases a

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,960
library php library called faker for

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,120
creating fakes

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,560
these are useful for database uh seating

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,639
and testing purposes

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,479
but faker grew grew over time you know

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,520
we became really really popular

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,000
as well as with other sdks like python

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,759
and and and and i think node and it has

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,280
so many different uh support for like

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,560
languages and data sets and it really

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
really became big

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,680
but faker is now a monolithic library so

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,919
even if you just need a partial data set

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,440
to fake user names for example in your

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,479
test you actually need to download the

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,639
entire library

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,680
the entire data state of other diff you

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,319
know different uh

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,759
faking data like like zip codes like

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,280
addresses you know whatever like first

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,080
names and last names everything you need

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,400
to download download all of it

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,280
so what happens you know a typical use

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,520
case for it

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,520
is people needing to fake usually one or

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,199
two things like a local or what or

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,199
or something like that but they end up

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,720
downloading 70 plus language

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,840
language based data fix so how often

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,919
have you considered

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,759
the size of a library as a concern

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,880
because yes it's only three megabytes

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,479
that you download it's not

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,080
you know a big library even it's not

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,639
going to the client side it's just on

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,080
your

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,199
cis and building testing but by 2019 it

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,520
already seen

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,120
hundreds of millions of downloads right

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,120
and so many contributors and so many

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,319
projects being dependent on it

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,720
it's really became big but had a moment

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,960
right

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,000
his inefficient library became

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,000
problematic

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,759
over the years faker has probably

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,960
emitted more than 11

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,080
metric tons of co2 equivalent so being

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,280
such a significant

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,919
contributor to climate change

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,199
killed him literally well not literally

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,680
but you know what i mean

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,479
so he actually proposed all of this and

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,400
as

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,639
you know what do i do next with it

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,280
francois has decided to

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,080
stop the library stop this project from

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,240
from being

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,240
an ongoing project and yes letting it

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,680
die but

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,759
let's find if there's a better way of

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,680
letting it die let it let it die in

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,960
a good way if it's possible so two

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,199
options

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,080
have uh have have emerged one is new

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,960
maintainers right

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,879
new maintenance can maybe take take the

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,520
lead maybe do a refactoring or something

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,840
around it

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,759
but francois noted in his blog post

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
summarizing the faker issue on the

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,720
planet

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,759
had actually uh you know he said he had

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,400
a bad experience

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,160
of this past library he created you know

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,080
with no ram for php

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,440
that when he handed it off it actually

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,720
you know then handed off to another

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,080
maintainer and another maintainer and

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,599
those new maintenance thought that the

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,000
code base was

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,919
well shitty so they started rewriting it

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
for a 2.0 release but

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,200
you know it sounds familiar right

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,519
rewriting and refactoring but then

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,399
six years passed from that and no new

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,800
release

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,479
so as with open source you know forks

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,839
with probably a better way uh as

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,959
francois wants it because new

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,399
maintainers

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,480
that's probably going to make it based

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,080
on his experience there the developers

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,240
offered to move faker to new

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,760
organizations but that would lose

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,240
reputation and all the stars that the

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,839
faker library has so the other options

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,480
that's on the table is just saying

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,880
goodbye which really is what happened

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,839
right repository got archived no new

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,160
pull requests

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,720
no new releases continues to be

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,600
available on the composer registry until

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,160
it fades

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,839
away of course if you're interested you

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,519
know there's a note from francois

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,519
uh you know you are welcome to create a

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,000
better faker probably gonna be

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,600
quicker uh uh you know nicer you know

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,839
don't need his authorization to do it

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
that is the beauty of open source right

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,560
so uh he had noted of course you'll

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,839
probably regret it in a few years as

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,839
open source maintainers burnout uh is uh

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,720
is clinching hard so open source is

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,200
great just do not forget what you did

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
what shouldn't you forget well the only

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
thing that lasts forever are

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,320
dependencies

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,880
uh don't think so love are you in love

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
well

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,120
hopefully for you it's gonna end well

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,680
but from my age not truly as well

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,959
uh but cats cats and videos on youtube

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,360
those are going to be

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,959
you know there forever so stay safe stay

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,440
secure if you have any questions

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,040
ping me um on twitter at the runner's

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
courthouse thank you for joining my

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,079
session today

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,079
and that's a wrap

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,079
sure i think you're on mute i am

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,680
and you missed my home what an awesome

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,000
session so let me do that again

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,519
even though i did well muted but yeah

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
that was a really great session that was

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,800
super

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,160
fun and i love the i love the slides too

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,600
um so what you're saying

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,800
is that while open source is awesome

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,120
there are still some things that you

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,560
really need to be wary of and be careful

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,000
and um tell me some tell me a horror

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,680
story that you ran into

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,959
not just like an industry one but

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,399
something that happened specifically to

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,399
you

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:45,120
oh uh with dependencies right

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,440
well is another one is promise is one of

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,360
them uh which got uh it's got an update

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,720
uh that broke a lot of things as well

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,600
because of the way that

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,000
um uh maintenance wanted to move fast

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,000
with

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,040
uh an esm kind of javascript uh

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,040
definitions which

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,560
didn't work really well uh so i mean

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,680
those those stories really happened all

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,839
the time it wasn't a lot

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,120
of of work on mayan to kind of put this

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,839
stuff together it's really interesting

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,160
to see that

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,839
you know dependencies are are great we

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,120
just need to be a bit more vigilant

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,519
and you know do the dual diligence and

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,360
just stay stay on top of them so

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,839
yeah that that's uh that's my story as

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,000
well and a good way to check that out is

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
a super nifty tool that uh

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
created called os advisor tell us a

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,959
little bit about our advisor

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,640
indeed go tell me about it you tell me

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,240
about it

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,800
i'm in my community i'm in my community

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,800
hat today

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,240
i know it is um so the open source

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,079
advisor is

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,360
is like a register like you'd go to npm

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,959
but then you need to figure out if

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,480
there's a community alive for it so you

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,760
go to github but then you want to figure

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,720
out how many downloads you go back to

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,079
npm it's like

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,320
back and forth what we're trying to do

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,399
with the sneak advisor is basically

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,320
a place where we pull the data for you

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,560
from all different places from sneak for

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,320
security from github for community from

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,480
npm for download you know we put a lot

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,800
of a lot of this data into place

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,639
uh we quantified for you we put like a

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,320
package overall health score

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,600
uh and then you have all that data to

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,560
look into and you know the way that we

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,320
score it as well

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,959
and that gives you just one uh you know

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,959
in one place and a consolidated view of

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,200
the package overall health

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,040
so yeah go check it out i'll be happy to

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,120
see uh you know if you uh ping me on

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,160
in the score that you got from it and uh

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,680
let's see uh you know

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,920
what's going on there that's awesome um

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,959
so just a quick you know like just in

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,160
one line i mean because you

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,079
brought together a lot of things that

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,079
happened but what would be your one

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,519
best tip if you could like summarize

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,839
like a quick uh

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,920
quick tip best practice how do you know

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,360
to avoid any of like kind of scenarios

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,079
or what's going on or where do you find

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,639
your information

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,399
or what's the best way to to get on top

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,079
of these types of things

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,920
yeah i'd say there are two two ways to

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,399
do it one way is the uh

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,040
kind of like the uh the proactive so the

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,040
way that

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,480
you know before you go into a package so

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,399
definitely do the

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,160
due diligence for it i know people who

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
have actually like scanned through the

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,480
code

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,839
and they actually check if you know if

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,639
that code is to their liking if it's

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,160
maintainable

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,440
just in case they would need to like

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,079
maintain it and the maintenance would

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,240
not be there

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,079
so to do that you know what really helps

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,440
is the sneak advisor to kind of like

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,040
let you know a bit you know what's going

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,279
on with the package is it maintainable

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,279
uh does it get like frequent uh releases

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,440
and so on so we try to do that

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,360
so that's when you choose a package or

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,360
want to move maybe to a different one

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,639
uh the other one is you know once you're

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,160
in right you have a project you have

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,839
dependencies at that point

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,519
monitor for it right you want to monitor

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,519
for your projects dependencies

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,040
uh you know sneak is a great tool for

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,519
that later on we're gonna add all of

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
those

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,959
package insights from the advisor as

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,399
well into it probably so it will give

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,519
you like all of this uh if

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,839
you could do like things like you know

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,839
if a project got a score below whatever

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,519
x number and you want to be aware of it

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,440
and maybe change it or do something

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,600
that's your that's a chance to do it so

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,880
you know choose your packages wisely and

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,639
of course monitor them for you know

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,199
security issues which might bite you in

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,680
production

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,560
you don't want to be at that point

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,120
awesome

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,720
thank you so much and thank you for
