Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	During the past 15 years I was lucky to partake in building and monitoring various production systems. However, while sometimes the monitors and alerts we created were spot-on, and helped us mitigate future failures quickly, other times the dashboards we created were simply useless, and the alerts did nothing but make us miserable. In this talk we will review several common monitoring mistakes my peers and I repeatedly tend to lean towards. We will discuss why these are not the right things to do, and suggest several, hopefully better alternatives.
