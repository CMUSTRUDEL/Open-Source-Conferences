Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Open Source is an integral part of virtually all modern software development. However, it is often too easy to not realize that some Open Source packages may come with strings attached to them - in the form of their license. In fact, some packages that might seem to be Open Source, may technically not be ones at all.
In the talk, some of the most commonly found licenses and their implications on end users will be discussed: - GPL-style licenses, including Affero GPL - BSD-style licenses - Source-available licenses.
If youâ€™ve never heard about these licenses, or if you did hear about them but never really bothered to understand how they may affect you - attending this talk may be a good idea.
