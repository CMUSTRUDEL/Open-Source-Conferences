Title: Cloud Native & OSS Spotlight Ignite: Crash Course   Open Sources Licenses, Zeev Suraski, Strattic |
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Open Source is an integral part of virtually all modern software development. However, it is often too easy to not realize that some Open Source packages may come with strings attached to them - in the form of their license. In fact, some packages that might seem to be Open Source, may technically not be ones at all.
In the talk, some of the most commonly found licenses and their implications on end users will be discussed: - GPL-style licenses, including Affero GPL - BSD-style licenses - Source-available licenses.
If youâ€™ve never heard about these licenses, or if you did hear about them but never really bothered to understand how they may affect you - attending this talk may be a good idea.

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,760
and uh

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,720
uh the next one up is uh a special

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,600
favorite of mine

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,199
uh it's uh a spotlight ignite actually a

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,240
ten minute long one

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,160
uh and it's about open source so you

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,719
know we we all use open source

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,360
uh but do we really understand what it

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,079
means

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,520
um and that's that's a very interesting

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,480
question to discuss and i'm going to

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,920
discuss that with

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,320
as ev there is one of the creators of

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,120
the

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,440
php programming language and has a lot

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,320
of mileage with the open source software

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,680
he'll make an order in the oss licenses

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,320
and their implications

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,920
uh even as much as stack overflow copy

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,280
pasting that we're all used to

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,120
so uh let me uh hey good morning

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,640
hi hi looking forward to uh

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,400
hearing uh more about your insights

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
about what we don't know and we should

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,080
know about

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,119
open source licensing so let me share

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,479
your screen

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,200
and the floors thank you very much the

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,320
time

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,640
so let's get started um so the first

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,600
uh first i want to try and explain why i

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,759
think it matters

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,600
um and the reason is that many

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,439
developers arguably probably most

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,240
developers and potentially even some of

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,720
you

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,479
think that uh if you can find source

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,720
code that helps you solve a problem

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,000
or complete your task or implement some

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,439
part of your system

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,040
then the fact that you have a visual

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,439
that you have a visual of it means you

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,119
can just use it unfortunately uh

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,960
the fact that uh you have the source

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,560
code available does not necessarily mean

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,079
you're allowed to use it and

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,600
even if you are allowed to use it this

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,159
does not necessarily mean you're allowed

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,719
to use it without any stings attached uh

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,960
open source licenses sometimes actually

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,119
often do have all sorts of requirements

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,119
and if you violate those requirements

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,960
knowingly or unknowingly

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,119
that could have unifications and this

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,679
could be all sorts of unification so

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,120
for instance you could get sued uh by

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,840
the copyright holder

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,760
uh maybe in a less extreme situation the

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,879
copyright holder may show up and

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,160
ask you to pay up for for

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,040
commercial license um another

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,599
arguably worse implication is that you

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,640
may

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,800
uh be uh subject to

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,160
losing parts or potentially even all of

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,519
your intellectual property because some

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,560
of these licenses

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,680
have requirements that get you to that

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,760
equality to publish

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,480
your uh um your source code if you use

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,519
um the if you use the source code in

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,959
turn

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,200
and that is if those first two

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,959
issues are typically kick in if your

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,360
violation becomes public but if

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,040
even if it doesn't come become public

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,400
then in situations

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,280
of uh m a and acquisitions during the

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,239
due diligence

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,159
almost always the acquire will be

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,239
scanning your source code to see

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,440
to check the license use and especially

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,959
open source license use

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
make sure you're not using anything that

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,879
you're not supposed to use or

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,239
using it outside of the license terms

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,440
and it would be kind of a bummer to bump

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,480
into such a hurdle

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,519
in kind of a late stage acquisition

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,799
um so now that we've hopefully

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,000
uh uh established white matters

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,319
um let's see what we need to know

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,480
so the super high level there are three

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,280
different types of families of licenses

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,680
that you're

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
likely to bump into it's a growth

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,360
generalization but that's kind of

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,879
as good as we're going to get in any

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,920
guide talk so

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,640
the first uh family is the gnostings

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,680
attached

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,120
uh kind of licenses and those are from a

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,920
developer's point of view those are

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,319
ideal

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,319
because uh well essentially there are no

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,519
things that that you can simply use

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,840
the code without any um

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,599
any special requirements sometimes

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,640
actually often there's an attribution

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,760
requirement that

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,760
requires you to mention the the source

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,319
that you mentioned that you're using

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,639
that uh that package or that source

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,880
um but other than that there's usually

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,680
just not any special requirements

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,800
uh and even if you forget to if you even

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,479
if you don't pay attention to the

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,840
tribution requirement typically no one

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,440
is going to come after you

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,360
um licenses that are in that family are

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,479
the bsd license the mit license their

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,280
patch license and many

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,639
more other like licenses and they're

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,759
used by a lot of projects

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,840
including obviously apache php node.js

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,080
and many many other

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,600
projects so those if you're using

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,120
any of those and you have not been

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,759
paying attention to open source

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,759
licensing

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,000
nobody your probably there's nothing

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,880
much you can do or if you want to really

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,880
uh be a good open source citizen then

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,000
handle attribution but that's about it

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,800
the second family is the copyleft

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
license

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
licenses which are also commonly

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,039
referred to as via licenses which is

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,680
kind of very appropriate in 2020

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,199
um these are exactly the antithesis to

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,680
the bsd style licenses

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,960
as they come with a gigantic uh sting

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
that is attached

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,199
and that requires code that uses them to

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,560
become available

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,320
under the same license terms uh in that

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,919
sense they're kind of like uh

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,759
infecting your cells called anything

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,560
that touches and uses them

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,479
uh they infect they infect that code

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,280
also with the same license and that is

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,360
why they

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,400
are uh often referred to as fire

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,560
licenses

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,360
notable the most notable license in that

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,479
family is the gpl the new public license

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,880
um with you know most of its variants

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,840
uh version two version three lgp and so

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,600
on and so forth

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,280
and there's a lot of software that uses

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,759
them too uh probably

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,680
as much as bsd style licenses including

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,600
my sequel and the linux kernel and

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,039
wordpress and so on

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,680
so uh if you're using those it's not

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,759
always

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,880
an issue because those licenses

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,400
typically the the viral nature of them

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,520
typically kicks in

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,960
when you distribute your software but be

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
advised that distributing your software

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,520
is not just

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,720
limited to making it publicly available

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,120
it's also

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,720
if you send it to a specific client it

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,199
constitutes distribution and

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,400
this vital nature kicks in if you have

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,520
it as a part of your

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,919
javascript for front end uh

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,080
then you know by definition your source

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,680
gets distributed to the browser

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,720
and that also constitutes uh

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,280
distribution so gpl

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,720
not necessarily uh impossible to use it

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,319
in a commercial environment but you

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,319
really have to know what you're doing

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,639
and if you're not sure you should you

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,160
know get some advice or you know search

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,680
your web and so on

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,039
there's another vend by the way i'm not

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,120
going to spend too much time on it the

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,440
agpl the third gpl and this one

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
is more dangerous it's a lot more it's

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,639
kind of like

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
a mutation that is a lot more infectious

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,479
because it kicks in even if you're using

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,759
it

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,759
only at the back end and you don't

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,400
distribute it but thankfully it's not

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,520
very very

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,599
common the third family is

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,720
the well everything else and there's a

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,000
lot of different

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,360
types of uh licenses uh

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,280
that are not bsd style or gpl style uh

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,560
i'm not going to cover all of them but

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,120
maybe

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,919
i do want to touch two sub-families the

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,360
first one

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,599
is the source available licenses

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,199
uh source available licenses are not

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,639
open source licenses they don't give you

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,199
the same kinds of uh

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,319
um of rights that all open source

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,479
licenses do

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,400
typically or not typically but sometimes

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,800
or maybe even often they don't give you

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,440
any

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,280
um rights at all to use the software so

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,120
the source code is available

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,520
but potentially that's about it you're

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,479
still not necessarily entitled to use it

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,400
uh in any environment uh and certainly

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,280
not necessarily a commercial environment

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,440
this is actually these are maybe more

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,000
common than you think because they are

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,039
central to a new business model the open

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,919
core model

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,680
uh where in many cases the core the the

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,759
center of the project

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,039
is open source using a traditional open

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,960
source license like the one

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,080
uh one belonging to the previous two

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,720
families

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,879
and uh there are all sorts of peripheral

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,400
or kind of enterprise features

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,879
uh that may uh be licensed under

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,240
uh like a source code available license

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,280
source available license

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,520
but you may still need to purchase a

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,839
commercial license in order to use them

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,120
so be advised again going back to my

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,519
place at the beginning the first thing

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,200
you can see the source code does not

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,719
mean that you're allowed to use it and

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,959
definitely that you're not

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,720
necessarily allowed to use to use it uh

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,519
with those things attached

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,800
the last the last subfamily of

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,240
everything else they want to touch

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,839
is code where um no

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,440
uh license is mentioned and uh

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,120
you may you might think that that means

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,320
that you can just use it when in fact

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,640
the opposite is true

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,600
if no license is mentioned then by

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,920
default in most

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
in most places the author deserves all

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,760
the rights even if they

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,839
don't want you that's the default and

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,000
you need to get explicit permission from

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,360
the author in order to use it so be

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,480
advised if you find a piece of code on

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,800
the web that is not

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,480
that doesn't mention any license not

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,880
sure that you should just use it

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,720
that part actually got me thinking uh

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,040
while i was researching for this uh

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,560
for this talk uh even though i have been

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,760
around open source licenses for many

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,959
many years i was wondering

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,399
what's going on with that overflow

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,519
that's kind of what we think about

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,120
getting a piece of code off the web um

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,880
and i was pretty sure that they handled

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,480
it somehow but i i was curious

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,000
how they made sure that you know you

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,519
take copying and pasting

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,519
a few lines of code from from the

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,320
website will not automatically

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,720
expose you to uh license issues so i

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,399
checked

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,839
and i was kind of surprised with what i

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,959
found um

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,600
hold on so uh yeah

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,240
this is where where you go to if you

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,320
look for

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,680
the you know what license uh stack

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,680
overflow is under

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,200
it that that itself is a bit off-putting

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,720
because there's a lot of detail here

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,079
not like simple human edible terms um

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,480
but essentially they're using the

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,560
hearing commons it's a it's it's a very

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,160
uh popular license for sharing knowledge

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,440
wikipedia uses it

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,160
um some photos on flickr use it and so

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,000
on and so forth

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,839
so i was looking to see you know the

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,880
most recent version and if you

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,519
uh dive into it uh then

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,360
it begins here where you're free to

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,560
churn adapt that looks great but if you

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,480
scroll down a bit

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,160
there are some requirements the first

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,279
one is the attribution requirement we

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,720
touched that earlier

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,320
no big deal but then there's the

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,079
share-like requirement which

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,360
if you eat it if you mix and swarm or

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,800
build upon the material you must

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,480
distribute your conclusions under the

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,240
same license as the original

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,160
that kind of sounds horrible uh if you

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,680
take a piece of code from stack overflow

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,279
does it mean that you now have to you

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,000
know make everything available

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,640
the creative commons that can't be true

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,680
so i

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,399
uh searched a bit more and i found uh

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,440
uh uh hold on i found first of all i

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,440
found this

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,480
so there's this um uh

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,480
post with 531 votes and

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,519
you know long story short uh they're

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,079
going to

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,760
uh starting february 1st 2016 they're

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,600
going to start to license those

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,880
code snippets on with the mit lines so

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,240
send me license super

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,640
permissive nothing awesome

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,320
how come it doesn't mention it on the

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,279
stack overflow website so

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,880
uh the follow-up that if you go into the

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,519
follow-up

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,839
let's populate this minus 337 votes here

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,680
and essentially they're saying bummer

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,600
the changes proposed here will delayed

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,959
indefinitely we'll get back to

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,800
and open some more discussions in the

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,760
future which the best of my knowledge

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,839
they never have

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,920
for whatever reasons they never change

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,320
their license even for new contributions

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,040
and

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,680
everything on stack overflow is still in

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,920
complicated

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,600
comments what it means uh

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,360
it's it's a bit up for debate but

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,720
generally there's definitely is that if

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,399
you take some still pass from stack

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,680
overflow which could be just a few lines

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,160
of code

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,720
it's been it's been full of laws in the

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,160
past

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,360
um potentially you have to make all of

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,240
your source code

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,600
uh you're having all of your source code

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,760
you have to expose all of your source

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,079
code on the locating comments

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,079
um i hope that you can hear me uh

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,639
uh i was told that i'm having my

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,920
issues i i hope that you did

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,560
take aways to somebody it's not uh

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,079
yeah just a bit of disruptions on the

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,120
microphone but uh yeah

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,200
go ahead with the the summary

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,399
okay so just to summarize first of all

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,839
remember that seeing the source code

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,920
does not necessarily equate to being

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,680
allowed to use it it often doesn't

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,120
so it does make sense and it is

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,399
important to take a look at the license

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
before use it

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,920
and if you don't understand what the

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,680
license means and get some consultation

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,560
not necessarily from a lawyer preferably

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,920
not a lawyer but

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,600
maybe a friend that has a better

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,120
understanding of how open source

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,320
licensing works

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,600
be way of source available licenses agpl

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,480
and no license because those can very

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,440
frequently be

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,680
problematic uh they typically are

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,920
problematic more often than not

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,040
if you distribute software including

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,880
just typed in

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,200
in your uh font encode or uh uh

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,000
sending a deployment into a specific

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
customer

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,519
you also need to be aware of copyleft

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,040
licenses like gpl

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,480
and finally and this is kind of your

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,519
decision whether you take the red pill

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,079
or the blue pill

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,680
uh i would go in the direction of uh

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,639
being inspired by stack overflow

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,959
solutions but

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,000
probably avoid copying and pasting stuff

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,079
on there but of course

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,199
it is up to you whether you want to

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,560
ignore it or

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,720
uh taking into it into consideration

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,560
and with that i'd like to thank you and

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,839
feel free to contact me

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,600
and have a gay test on the conference

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,880
thank you very much dave i think uh

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,399
especially the thing about stack

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,320
overflow that was the more uh

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
most staggering thing for me like uh to

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,920
realize that we've been

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,440
the common practice of uh of course for

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
me as well

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,600
has such a implication it's been so so

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,399
long around and still we're not aware of

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,760
that so uh

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,760
thanks very much for sharing that with

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,399
us we'll be chosen times about the

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,880
guys we won't be able to have a q a now

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,880
but

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,720
there will be available for you on the

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:37,120
uh uh discord so

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:37,120
