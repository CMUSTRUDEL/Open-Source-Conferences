Title: DevSecCon Ignites: Hacker Rights, Chloe Messdaghi, Point3 Security | Community Summit TLV
Publication date: 2020-12-26
Playlist: Community Summit TLV 2020
Description: 
	Sixty percent of hackers don’t submit vulnerabilities due to the fear of out-of-date legislation, press coverage, and companies misdirected policies. This fear is based on socially constructed beliefs. This talk dives into the brain’s response to fear while focusing on increasing public awareness in order to bring legislation that supports ethical hackers, ending black hoodie and ski mask imagery, and encourage organizations to support bilateral trust within their policies.

you may have heard of wosek or hacking

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,039
is not a crime or we are hackers

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,399
probably known as

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,239
women hackers those are all

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,680
organizations that i've either founded

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,240
or co-founded

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,000
um learn more about me at my url right

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,080
down there and also feel free to follow

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,080
me on instagram or on twitter that is my

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,520
handle my dms are always open okay

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,040
enough about me let's go into the real

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,960
stuff while you're here

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
first things first what are hackers

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,720
versus attackers now the

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,600
one thing i always tell people it's they

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,159
do they

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,280
use the exact same skill set but for

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,920
different intent

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,040
different reasons hackers are those to

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,040
serve and protect

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,079
attackers are there to do malicious

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,600
activities

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,840
and it's important to distinguish the

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,320
two because that is why we have problems

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,399
today

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,240
so what rights do hackers have at this

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,000
time um

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,680
well trick question for you it's

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,799
basically we have none we have

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,399
absolutely no rights at all

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,560
and the reasons for that is simply

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,280
because legislation has been created

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,600
that was

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,759
very much at a date also no

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,680
representation was there of the hacker

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,520
community when they were being made

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,680
instead legislation was created out of

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,080
fear base without actually

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
having representation that to share that

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,480
there's two separate parties

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,920
attackers versus hackers and in return

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,800
of that that's why we have legislation

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,879
that is hurting

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,280
our community this is also one of the

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,959
reasons why organizations also stay away

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,959
from hackers is because

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,800
once again there's laws out there that

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,800
uh basically have this belief that

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,440
hackers are these devious people when

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,160
reality

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,840
those are attackers so organizations

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,000
when they're contacted by hackers to

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,120
share about vulnerabilities

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,959
they either ignore them or they serve

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,480
them with lawsuits tied to a computer

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,120
fraud abuse act or

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,599
legislation that you find in any country

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,160
that is anti-hacking

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,840
also media coverage of hackers usually

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,840
when you do a google search you'll see

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,560
imagery of a hooded figure

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,319
a schema someone who's in the dark you

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,640
you never really see their face but also

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,400
that

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,159
they're using the wrong terminology

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,720
they're using the term hackers instead

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,599
of

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,080
cyber criminals attackers criminals just

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,040
general

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
malicious actors and because of that

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,920
that then

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,040
goes into the public perception of who

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,200
are hackers

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,480
versus attackers the thing is the public

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,080
does not know there's two different

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,159
parties and thus they

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,360
are afraid of us they have socially

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,000
constructed beliefs

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,680
of who we are in the community and that

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,200
we're these terrible beings when in

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,959
reality we're actually there behind

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040
scenes trying to protect them

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,120
but being seen as someone who's someone

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,799
negative

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,120
but we can change that and i just want

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,400
you to know is that if you break it down

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,720
by organizations

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,680
media and legislation we need all three

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,159
of them

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,920
to be able to get rights for the first

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,440
time the first things first we need

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,000
organizations to have vulnerability

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,920
disclosure

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
policies so we know who to contact

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,799
what's in scope

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,319
so you can be able to fix the

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,400
vulnerabilities before the attacker

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,959
finds it doesn't report it and then

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
takes advantage of it and extorts you

00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,760
the other thing is to work with the

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,599
media so they know that there's a

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,959
difference between attackers and hackers

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,760
because most of the time they do not

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,000
know

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,799
also to let them know that the imagery

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,599
that they use

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,439
of a hooded figure with a ski mask or in

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,200
the basement is not a true reflection of

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,720
what hackers look like we look like all

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
different things and if you want to have

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,560
a good idea what hackers look like

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,359
go check out hackie is not a crime we

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,520
have this special campaign called

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,440
hacker stories where you can see and

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,040
hear hackers talking about why they

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,479
became a hacker and the issues that

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
they've faced

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,080
last but not least why having

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,560
organizations and media involved

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,520
this then pushes for legislators to take

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,080
action

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,720
because we need the public to help us

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,960
out

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,120
to understand that the current out of

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,600
date legislation

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,639
did not reflect properly and has caused

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
a lot of issues

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,479
where people that are protecting and

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,520
serving that are hackers

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,440
are dealing with possible getting locked

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,560
up for trying to do something good in

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,960
good faith

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,080
and that should not be happening the

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,800
laws are written to

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,039
protect the public but in reality it

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,240
doesn't protect them enough

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,800
by allowing that basically no

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,360
entry point for hackers to help and

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,360
serve

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
and make sure that you're safe and

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,080
protected

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,520
you're allowing attackers to have a

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,759
stronger uh

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,440
action to be able to take advantage of

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,680
you

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,919
now how can we get rights you now know

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,960
kind of how we could go about it

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,639
but how it works is we work together and

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,280
if you want to get involved in full

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,759
depth go check out

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,160
hackinessnotacrime.org

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,759
and volunteer partner with us if you're

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,639
an organization

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,160
advocate we have plenty of advocates out

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,560
in the space that are out there trying

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,720
to change socially constructed beliefs

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,919
so then we can change how the public

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
perception of who we

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,000
are in the mindset so we can get rights

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,919
for the first time ever

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
if you have any questions dm me on

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,280
discord or on twitter

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
and thank you guys so much for existing

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,199
to me and thank you for having

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,120

minutes thank you so much and have a

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:15,440
