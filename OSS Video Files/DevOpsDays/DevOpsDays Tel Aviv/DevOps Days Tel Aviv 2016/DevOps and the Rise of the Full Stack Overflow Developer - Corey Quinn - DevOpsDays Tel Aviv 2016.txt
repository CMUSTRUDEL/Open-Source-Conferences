00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:12,459
so for those who weren't here or those

00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:14,980
who work last year I proposed a very

00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:18,730
fair and balanced open spaces talk

00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,560
called why docker is horseshit and based

00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,030
upon all of your feedback I then turned

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,789
it into an ignite and then a larger

00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,610
conference talk so as a result you all

00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:29,650
are now my test audience you did this to

00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:33,220
yourself what you're about to hear is

00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:38,079
your fault not mine so now a DevOps

00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:42,399
poetry reading hickory dickory dock ER

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,410
I'm kind of a crop public talker last

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,750
year I had a bit on why Dockers

00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:51,790
horseshit needs to be a critical prod

00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:55,930
breaking blocker any Googlers here in

00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:59,530
the crowd you folks should all be mighty

00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:02,379
proud I was a cheerleader and then you

00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:08,920
killed reader who the gonna trust

00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:11,499
Google cloud this might go on a bit

00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,619
longer this whole show has been quite a

00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:17,439
monster I don't see palantir but

00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:27,310
Facebook is here so they win their the

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:29,880
creepiest sponsor if you're build

00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,770
release process is vast and unclear

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,130
rejoice friend docker containers are

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,229
here now your shitty deployment has

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:44,439
wrecked my enjoyment of the show

00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:46,209
that was once my career devops poetry

00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,209
readings give me a case of the sweat

00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:51,609
ease so let's talk instead about Bigfoot

00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:54,759
and yetis these things don't exist

00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:58,079
they're beings of myth like a real

00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,079
reason to use cooper Nettie's

00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:05,789

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,250

00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:10,379
a text Microsoft scared that their next

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:18,209
but it just feels like I'd be punching

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:21,269
down this conference has been super

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:24,660
pleasant talking operations past future

00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:27,900

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:36,299

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:39,180

00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:43,250
