00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:12,750
so as I said Eric work at big panda and

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,000
and as for my martial arts background I

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,369
have been doing martial arts lots of

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,400
different ones since I've been about the

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,560
age of seven and the more specific one

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,720
to this ignite is having training at

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,910
waking foo since 2008 so just a small

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,619
disclaimer I don't know if everybody you

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,910
noticed I have this really fashionable

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,829
limp and so I'm officially lame in a

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,579
kung-fu practice about two months ago

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,989
ago I am tired my calf muscle which is a

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,879
lot of fun actually wrote this

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,920
presentation while on crutches had a

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,250
really good pan but it that went away

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:54,000
because I can almost walk again eh so

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,059
yeah that's a small disclaimer as for

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,609
kung fu a kung fu in Chinese is has

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,760
actually nothing to with martial arts it

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,070
means a being really good at something

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,220
or even best at something through hard

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,350
work and extreme exercise and this is

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,479
extremely similar to the learning curve

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,909
and in women MX so um a discharge this

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,619
could be like your first job as a help

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,049
desk or system in or even your first

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,000
martial art practice it's extremely

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,799
similar everything is hard and

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,700
frustrating you're saying these other

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,829
guys doing a hard things and doing them

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,630
seamlessly and you keep getting errors

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,299
and everything is hard you get bruises

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,710
and after each encounter you go home you

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,189
can barely walk you're absolutely

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,950
exhausted and then after a while your

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,720
body gets used to it hey you get a

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,670
muscle memory you Betty actually

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,610
remembers how to do things and it does

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,590
things better over time so it's just a

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,090
simple punch could be way simpler

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,729
because you will do it in more leaner

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,649
age away and you discover helpful tools

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:02,850
that help you do things easier like

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,189
eunuchs baha loader a unix pipes a and

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,869
you're no longer the youngest junior on

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,259
board so you seen a couple of these

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,970
things before it's not all the first a

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:16,050
the first time you encounter them

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:17,640
and then you get cocky right yeah you've

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,070
been doing this for a couple months and

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,840
you're like oh I know kung fu and I've

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,660
done a darker tutorial my god I know

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,930
everything right and you get cocky and

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,060
as you get cocky you get sloppy and this

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,550
is something that a senior people in

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,430
martial arts really like to identify and

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,320
try to teach that cocky Junior Ellison

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,210
but in the worst case scenario you

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,310
actually encounter something you thought

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,580
you could do great and you really don't

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,350
need to get whooped badly but you get

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,570
back up from that you understand that

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,820
this is not the end of the world and a

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,430
you get better you keep on training and

00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,250
you move on from that and as you gain

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:59,400
experience you start learning and how to

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,790
use more tools at your disposal this

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,830
could be knives tmax nunchucks or even

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,160
being able to search an error in Google

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,530
and finding the relevant result and as

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,780
you get on you do like extreme things

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,350
during your trainings like push-ups with

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,300
people on your back or is saying to your

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,260
father-in-law that's okay I'll fix your

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,530
windows no problem and as you go on you

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,870
get a senior and you get in this state

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,910
of god mode again you've built this

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,430
system right you wrote everything you've

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,950
seen every error there is and this silly

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,110
junior comes along right and he has a

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,600
fresh set of Isis and it suggests

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,480
another solution and hello there and

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,940
you're like other I'm gonna dismiss this

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,650
silly young man he he does not know

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,930
anything and you get your ass whipped

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:54,269
again and as you go on you gather

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,790
achievements right you got our belts you

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,010
do like the extremely strange push-ups

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,470
and no i do not do those pushups you

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:05,940
even get an endorsement and linkedin for

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:08,160
XML which is awesome a-and you then

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,140
understand that okay I'm really enjoying

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,630
this I want to contribute back right so

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,250
you get involved with community work you

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:18,150
start assisting your trainer perhaps

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:21,630
tutor or mentor a junior you even invest

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:23,810
in open source as well and then finally

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:27,590
you get in a state of

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,780
Zen master a you understand that you can

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,210
never know everything similar to a fish

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,430
eyes talk hey you understand it you must

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,370
always keep an open mind and learn keep

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,410
up with everything that comes up you

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,210
must you understand it the best way to

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,139
learn is actually by learning and

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:47,450
sharing knowledge to others and and you

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,090

Zen master but luckily I was able to

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,880
find a picture of a state of absolute

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:08,960

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:15,590
