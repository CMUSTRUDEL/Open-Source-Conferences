00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,469
so why did I go you with this annoying

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,639
demo that basically shows nothing um

00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:16,770
that's a very good question

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,980
and so you notice that this actually

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,270
resembles the actual work more than just

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,970
you know all the demo you see where

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,010
everything works usually when you do

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,019
something at the office you expect it to

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,029
be simple you write something it should

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,219
take like five minutes but then you got

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,690
sidetracked and you start doing a lot of

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,820
you know stupid babbling about

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,469
unrelated stuff like Python - and Python

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,360
3 which you didn't even care about the

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,510
only one to use flask and then you

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,940
discover that you know pyc which is like

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,550
what is that like even Python dynamic

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,200
what is the PI API see anyway getting in

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,030
your way and a lot of yak shaving

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,489
basically and this is actually how we

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,739
work our model of work where you know

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:59,340
you just go and do stuff is completely

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:02,100
bogus and and the reason is complexity

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,229
basically so I wrote five lines of code

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,240
which is supposed to be simple but

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,740
actually if you start thinking about it

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,930
what I've actually actually done I've

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,390
all castrated the Python model and that

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,430
Python module has dependencies so I'm

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,689
actually using six Python modules so if

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,240
we count the number of lines of code

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:21,030
there it's about 40,000 lines of code

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,409
of course that uses see Python and you

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,270
know are the C libraries like open the

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,570
cells so on so it's actually five

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,930
million lines of code but there is that

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,509
thing that's called operating system

00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,759
their lineups in my case actually or six

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,430
but Linux is you know additional thirty

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,310
million lines of code so it's like five

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,500
lines of code but dragging on the

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,770
complexity of about forty million lines

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,000
of code so this is very important to

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,829
understand you know whenever someone

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,540
comes to you and say let's use a micro

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:56,790
service it's gonna be so simple twelve

00:01:51,540 --> 00:02:00,360
250 lines of JavaScript yeah right this

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,369
is what our universe looks like and this

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,450
is an actual representation of Python

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,670
dependencies on pipe I and my code or

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,050
your code in that whatever the case is

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,560
is that tiny dot over there and then

00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,570
the feud galaxy we all live in a complex

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,610
system we're surrounded by a lot of

00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,650
modules a lot of libraries a lot of

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,060
services and we interact with them and

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,120
we can't actually achieve anything

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,250
without using all that and it's so

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,530
complicated there's this whole big

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,500
universe around us that we're completely

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:36,490
unaware of

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,740
so basically complexity and complexity

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,920
grows in another line alarming late so

00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,050
I'll give you an interesting statistic

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,420
medical knowledge for example doubles

00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:49,630
every five years now how long is medical

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,060
school here in Israel seven years so

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,940
with a tiny go out of medical school

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,500
everything you know is deprecated

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,150
well not deprecated because some of it

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,130
is still relevant the basics are still

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,470
relevant but everyone is ahead of you

00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,180
already and you've just finished school

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,390
do you continue learning

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,280
1john no you have to work well of course

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:13,260
you have specialty then you have

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,430
subspecialty then we're gonna have sub

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,590
subspecialty maybe sub sub sub sub

00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,800
specialty at some point we're going to

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,630
be learning for 30 years just to get to

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,220
the tip of knowledge of current

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:29,440
knowledge not even you know advances it

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,930
got to the point where no student person

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,790
today actually understands how things

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,610
work from top to bottom you're gonna in

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,530
her plane you know if you're in a

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,210
Aeronautics engineer you might

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,070
understand how to prune the floodplain

00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,870
flies but you don't understand the

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,940
engine you definitely don't understand

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,850
the program that's you know on the

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,340
autopilot if you're a programmer maybe

00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,600
you understand the autopilot maybe but

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,160
you definitely don't understand how the

00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,230
plane flies and so on

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,530
nobody completely understands the system

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:02,190
this is also true for our systems I have

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,950
no idea how the colonel works it's magic

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,230
it's magic I can open it I can read the

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,360
code of course I can but it's a lot of

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,830
code and a lot of complexity and a lot

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,840
of demands that are not really familiar

00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,790
with it's gonna take me a lot of years

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,850
to truly understand the caramel and by

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:22,210
that time I have to deal with databases

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,550
web servers networking and so on it's

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,590
impossible to understand

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:32,190
no single person can fit everything

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:35,729
inside his head cool so how do we

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,310
actually get done basically we have

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,990
faith and without faith we wouldn't be

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,539
able to function in this world we have

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,539
faith that the ceiling won't fall on our

00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:48,210
heads we trust you know that some civil

00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:49,979
engineer did the necessary computations

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:54,120
and you know found that the ceiling is

00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:56,099
strong enough but we don't know we

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,050
haven't checked the numbers we don't

00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:00,870
understand enough engineering to verify

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,280
the numbers basically we believe we

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,319
believe everything will be okay

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,300
we go on a plane we believe the plane

00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:10,020
will not crash that it will actually get

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,199
off the ground we need faith in order to

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,199
be productive basically we believe in

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,020
the sack abstractions that's the way we

00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,330
work we use abstractions because we

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,039
can't fit everything inside our head now

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:29,819
what is the problem with abstractions

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:34,259
what sorry they don't always work yeah

00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:36,449
that's very very true so let's give an

00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:39,000
example every day anybody heard about

00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:43,020
this zookeeper Poisson packet after live

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,669
Adam no oh another person cool so look

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,000
at with a Poisson packet that was

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,199
discovered by pager duty I recommend

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,949
that you with it it's very interesting

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,949
read basically it's four different bugs

00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:59,190
- bugs in zookeeper one bug in in the

00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,539
TCP stack basically bypassing hosta

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,659
hosta sorry

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:07,710
checksum checks in the kernel of IPSec

00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:12,240
packets and then another bug in their a

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:14,580
es encryption model on in line and Linux

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,669
but only on Zen politician

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:22,889
virtualization modes versions 3.1 and

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:24,840
4.3 it's like what does and it

00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,539
interacted between three completely

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,300
separate layers that all had were

00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:32,399
supposed to have like solid abstractions

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,790
they were not supposed to be interacting

00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,160
ever and then it happened

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,510
and this is actually very common much

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,040
more common than you would think if you

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,020
stop looking up on the internet or in

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,470
post mortems you would see that that

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,540
kind of stuff happens all the time but

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:52,440
no single person understands the whole

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,930
stack how do you even bug this like

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,320
would you even look at the IPSec of the

00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:01,620
kernel when you had this little bug

00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:03,630
probably not so it took page really a

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,430
very long time to find this bug and they

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,100
worked on it about a mile over in

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,560
manufacturing and even after were a lot

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,610
of time they spent researching this

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,670
whole thing they still are not actually

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,040
sure what the hell went wrong and this

00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:24,330
is again very common we don't understand

00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,920
what's going on the law of liquor

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:30,600
abstractions this was written by Joe

00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,070
Spolsky about like 14 years ago Louis um

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,800
if you don't know this go read it

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,640
literally cool basically all

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,020
abstractions to some degree or leaky

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,180
everything breaks and all abstractions

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,830
will break and everything will leak up

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,560
and we will have to debug this it's a

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,270
fact of life yes we need abstractions in

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,280
order to be productive but we have to

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,870
understand that they they all leak at

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,440
some point we will have to debug them

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:57,960
but again no single person understands

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,150
how the entire system works how do we

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,120
even get about this how do we know that

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:06,960
we need to debug this it's a big problem

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:11,310
so let's take a look at how we work

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,380
today currently so as an engineer you

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,600
know you learned how to code you code

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,750
for a few years you did some stuff you

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,190
built some applications and you learn

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,960
some architecture and design patterns

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:26,550
and you know the stuff that they teach

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,830
you maybe some TDD and then you change

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,400
your job maybe every every two years or

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:34,860
so because why not and then you may be

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,450
interested in longer so you go to a

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,070
company that uses and then you

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,900
hear that no js' is the next best thing

00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,210
so you go work for this company that

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,460
uses nodejs

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,410
and basically the average lifespan of an

00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,670
average tenure of an engineer currently

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:54,040
is about two to three years in a company

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:56,440
your job and we focus on features when

00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,460
we do stuff we need to get to all our

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,790
stuff to all products and features we

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:06,430
accommodate a lot of technical debt and

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,500
we only fix stuff when it breaks and we

00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,900
only do the minimal amount that we have

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,330
to do in order to get things to work and

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:17,050
then we continually we add more features

00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:19,840
and more features and more features and

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,790
when we build systems basically we just

00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,020
slap on a couple of libraries maybe we

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,390
add a framework because you know

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,150
frameworks are cool so why not why not

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:31,030
to lose Ruby on Rails and maybe you know

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,320
nodejs and react at the same time

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,840
because why not

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,370
and then we slap on database but you

00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,290
know we need to scale because obviously

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,380
the company is gonna have 1 million

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,570
users you know next week so we have to

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,730
use Cassandra and both of them and

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,490
you know Kafka just you know to get

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:51,370
everything connected and this is how we

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,780
build stuff when we ramp on really fast

00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,240
because it's all open source and cool

00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,310
and maybe get calf Kaiser survey so

00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,230
elasticsearch you know as a service so

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:03,310
it's so easy to add all those components

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:06,850
and then we code and we test and

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:09,310
released and our code is you know just

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,140
tiny amounts of code five lines of code

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,360
here five lines of code they're just the

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:18,580
glue between all those components so

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:21,310
easy and organizations are also

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,680
structured in a very similar way we've

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,470
got management we've got procedures on

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,180
documentation to guide everyone got

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,160
departments and why do we have

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,580
departments because no single person

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:37,030
understands the job so you know we have

00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,430
to kind of contain the job intern area

00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,490
that we can actually fit in our head and

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,750
then we've got architects know

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,250
orchestrating the where departments work

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,490
within one another and technology is

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,940
built with one another

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,940
basically very

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,059
okay we're back in

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,600
last year I was here in a nothing I was

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,330
speaking of DevOps today's about

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,240
mathematics and throughout my entire

00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,670
talk everything stops working you know

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,020
all the time the the projector laptop

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,060
everything at some point I was starving

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,250
jumping on the up and down on the floor

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:35,350
to make everything work so apparently

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:37,209
it's my destiny to break stuff anyway so

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,470
basically the interesting observation

00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:40,300
that I've seen anyway in your

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,750
organization's is that we have teams on

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,880
the bottom but as you move up up in the

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,410
hierarchy around organizations you can

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,750
you actually see that you have

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,610
individuals on top you almost don't see

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,440
teamwork on top you've got a team of

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,320
developers but you don't have a team of

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,880
CEO deal we've got one CEO one chief

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,550
architect and so on very interesting

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,200
basically we're building everything

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,510
assuming that we live in a predictable

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,370
world in a world that we can understand

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,680
and this is the reason why we've

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,380
designed our organizations or our

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,330
systems in such a way the reason why we

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,490
have individuals at the top is because

00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,020
we're assuming one single person can

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:24,300
actually understand all the relevant

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,300
context and this is not the case

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:31,000
software development is a learning

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,380
process we don't understand the world we

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,790
don't understand the problem we don't

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,800
understand the environment we don't

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,360
understand our clients and where will

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,430
when we will build in software we'll

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,990
basically learning we're learning the

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,790
environment we'll learn the system we'll

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,339
learn new technologies all the time

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,290
we're researching our own system because

00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:50,860
sometimes we don't even understand the

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:53,350
system that we've built if you spent six

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,120
years building a system it's going to be

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,709
complex to the point where you don't

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,240
actually understand the system and you

00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:02,350
will have to research and learn that

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,020
system when you add new features so this

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,490
is very very important to understand

00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,839
once you understand that software

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,450
program development is a learning

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,339
process you start rethinking how we work

00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,339
and how we construct our organizations

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,290
software development is not a sprint

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,579
contrary to what the edge has

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,890
methodologists with the or I should say

00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:25,300
acolytes who tell you it's not a sprint

00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,180
it's a marathon it

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,279
a very very long time to get anything

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:34,450
done especially if it's big and

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:36,160
complicated and you know worthwhile the

00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,080
Sistine Chapel for example this

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,060
particular painting took four years to

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,350
paint

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,810
Michelangelo spent two years on his back

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,339
bending this and he had sixteen helpers

00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,230
doing and helping him with this picture

00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,630
the whole of the Sistine Chapel took

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:53,170
about twelve years to complete it takes

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:55,690
a long time learning takes a very very

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,339
long time and it's not only the

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:00,010
accumulation of knowledge at some point

00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,600
you know knowledge consolidates and you

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,149
start getting intuition you start

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,550
understanding things you start ramping

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:08,769
up your knowledge this takes years for

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,510
physics students or chemistry students

00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:13,060
it takes about two to three years just

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:15,610
to you know you start to actually um

00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,200
consolidate knowledge and transition

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,630
from the state where you know you've got

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,180
a bunch of unrelated courses to actually

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,290
understanding physics it's the same for

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,019
everything that we're doing everything

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,730
that we learn in software it takes again

00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:29,470
two or three years just to start to

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,060
understand that just to understand the

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,770
mechanics of software and transition

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,630
from a state where you have a bunch of

00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,370
algorithms and a bunch of you know a

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:41,410
languages that you know and actually

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:44,680
have knowledge expertise takes a very

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,510
very long time my sequel and puskás have

00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,450
been developed for over 20 years

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:52,589
my sequels for 21 years Bosco's for 10

00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:55,390
20 years and they're not done yet -

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:58,810
still very much alive and very much in

00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:02,649
development and why is that because it's

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:05,260
an evolution Masika unprocessed have

00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:08,260
evolved the clients have co-evolved with

00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,209
Bossk rested with my sequel the

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,190
databases have learned more about the

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,510
universe about the needs of the clients

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,579
about the environment the operating

00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:18,160
environment that also kept changing and

00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:20,050
evolving the clients the people who

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,820
build applications they also learned

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,290
about the way past course is doing stuff

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,390
the better way my sequel is doing stuff

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,329
about how databases behave they also

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:31,440
evolved this is a process of very very

00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:35,589
slow evolution of coevolution actually

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,149
and it takes time and we have to go

00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,350
through this process in order to get

00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:43,810
something that works

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:47,100
and you know works well both dental

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:50,710
maturity but how can we have maturity if

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,450
we you know change framework every time

00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,410
new from JavaScript framework comes

00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:57,820
along which is basically every two weeks

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,660
how can we have a to Atia when we were

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,850
changing changing jobs every two years

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,420
again learning takes a very very long

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,570
time

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:11,820
expertise takes a long time expertise

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:14,350
takes about 20 years to develop 20 years

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,630
is there anyone in this room who's been

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:21,490
at the same job you know or the same

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:23,860
domain for 20 years anyone one to two

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:29,560
people that's it so we have two experts

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:31,420
in this room that's it so we need better

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,940
coping mechanisms for a complicated

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,490
world you should go talk to koa Quinn

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,940
about this he knows a lot about coping

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:44,200
mechanisms for their apps yeah go talk

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,270
to him after this so we all have R&D

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,810
departments here's a question

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:51,240
I've I've observed people you know in

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,480
all the departments doing development

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:59,320
but once the research what research are

00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,030
they doing in R&D so often you would go

00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,110
to company and you'd ask the words the

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,520
research and they would point to

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,600
different departments called research

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,160
department for people doing algorithms

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,750
okay but then you have the R&D

00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,870
department which is not doing research

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:16,900
so what exactly are they doing well they

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:20,800
are in R&D so what kind of research

00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:22,660
should we have in R&D we need to search

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,430
in their own systems when we need to

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,040
research development methodologies and

00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,870
development processes and we need to

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,600
research the operating environment that

00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:36,040
we live in because it's complicated and

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,600
it keeps changing all the time so the

00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,190
kind of organizations that we want to

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,550
build our learning organizations

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,910
organizations that are built for around

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,170
the concept of learning and research

00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,410
first of all we need to understand that

00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,020
engineers you need different skills

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,180
debugging is

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,100
a very very important skill for a

00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,540
complicated and complex world because

00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,550
you know if you don't understand the

00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,070
world you need to debug it and you need

00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:03,410
to be able to learn and slice and dice

00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:07,010
it and be able to extract new knowledge

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:09,470
from that world this is a very very real

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,640
skill with engineers a lot of Engineers

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,020
don't know how to debug

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,760
nobody ever required this from them and

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:19,070
sometimes they were actually discouraged

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,690
from debugging maybe someone didn't give

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:25,630
them good the machine so they couldn't

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:27,410
debug we need system thinking you know

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,840
understanding how everything fits

00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,950
together not just your local tiny part

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,180
because again five lines of code right

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,820
we need resource material research

00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,590
methodologies I was lucky to learn

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,420
University some research methodologies a

00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,460
lot of people were not are lucky they

00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,870
don't know how to research they don't

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,480
know how to construct to work in theory

00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,250
or you know conduct an experiment which

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,220
is again very important for solid

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,950
learning and of course we need teamwork

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,260
because no single person understands the

00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:00,680
system we need a team of people to

00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:03,440
understand the system we need to build a

00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,930
body of knowledge experts domain experts

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,940
and we need those domain experts I don't

00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,440
think Wix could function if we didn't

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,570
have people that were there for six

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,550
seven years and basically know the

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,620
history of the system now everything

00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,690
fits together and what would break if we

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,490
change this and you know what will be

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,860
pulled apart if we change this here

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,240
maybe something on the up the opposite

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,220
side of the system and we have those

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,440
people we have people that have been in

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,540
works for that long and know the ins and

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,700
outs of the entire system and would be

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,120
very very hard to function without those

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:37,670
people so we need people that have a

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,320
very long tenure in every company every

00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,000
successful company at least you would

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:46,550
find some people that have been in that

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,470
company for a very very long time but

00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:51,050
you also need those to give those people

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,940
with the resources and time to develop

00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,410
they need time for research time for

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,570
learning

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:58,430
Raziel and if you've written if you've

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,940
read an academic paper about software

00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:03,890
development in the last year ok that's

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,600
about 1/4 of the room

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:10,550
you should all be reading academic

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,770
papers and not just once a year okay

00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:15,200
sorry but reading who will read an

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,510
academic paper in last year that's again

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,830
about third of the room and so it's

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,020
interesting to see that it's the same

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,060
amount of people reading and writing so

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,550
yeah we should all be reading academic

00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:29,960
papers constantly this is learning we

00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:32,240
need to understand how things work we

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,630
also need system thinkers we need people

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,090
who know everything horizontally but not

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,820
necessarily deep people who are expert

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,910
in its integration and debugging and how

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:47,510
things work together how are we going to

00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:49,070
get those people we need people that you

00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,320
know move between technologies but not

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,340
necessarily between systems people are

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,360
experts at systems we all have them

00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,090
sometimes we call them operations

00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,070
problem solvers and so on but they're

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,810
very very important because in a complex

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,330
world where everything connects scared

00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:07,250
together you cannot debug anything if

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,080
you don't have someone who knows how

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:13,010
things connect and how things working in

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:16,490
unison and also experts learning because

00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:18,410
their job is constantly getting into new

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:23,900
systems that they don't know and ramping

00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:27,710
up knowledge at a very fast rate we need

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,700
to design with complexity in mind just

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,270
slapping on a couple of libraries

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,950
without regard to complexity is horrible

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:36,230
this is how we got to the soil situation

00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,240
that we don't understand the system we

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,490
should try to religiously simplify the

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,520
system if it's possible often it's not

00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:45,650
possible to simplify the system in this

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,020
case we should undo should realize that

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,970
the understandability and debug ability

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,830
invisibility our prime concerns for the

00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,560
system we should be designing for

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,790
understandability if you can't fit the

00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,620
design of the system in your head

00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,810
there's no chance you will ever be able

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:04,130
to debug it and find problems or even

00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:06,350
predict what the system will do ok this

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:08,150
is not the case unfortunately often when

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,640
people select library they don't even

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,170
check if that libraries debuggable when

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,610
he doesn't even know me emit metrics

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,470
maybe it's written in such a way that

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,330
it's impossible to debug this is not

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:20,320
even a decision

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:22,090
criteria for most people so again this

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,169
is should be a primary focus when we

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:29,110
design systems and finally we should

00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:32,679
learn the value of maturity Moga is now

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,120
better but few years back everyone was

00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,130
like his web skills you should use

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,870
 it's like one year old but he

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,630
kidding me database mature and takes

00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:44,260
about 15 years to become a chore fifteen

00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:46,750
years okay we should learn the value of

00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,309
maturity and especially we're talking

00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,409
about infrastructure because everything

00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:52,539
is really built on top of infrastructure

00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:56,860
infrastructure needs to be predictable

00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:59,889
and understandable and experience with

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,830
technology is very very valuable this is

00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:04,510
how we gain faith this is how we get to

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,789
the situation where we can actually

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:09,519
believe in out the abstraction works

00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:11,559
because we have experience with it we

00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,570
know the quakes of the system we know

00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,549
where to look when something breaks we

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,919
know how to debug it operating

00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:21,760
experience is probably one of the most

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:25,090
undervalued qualities and software

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,760
development unfortunately we need to

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,590
prefer momentum over velocity so every

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,049
time I go to the software engineering

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,210
conference there are people just speak

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:35,740
about velocity velocity velocity which

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,130
are velocity and development blah blah

00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,649
blah

00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:41,429
we should have momentum and momentum

00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:43,809
comes from solid infrastructure and

00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:46,389
momentum takes a lot of time to build

00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:51,519
again this is a marathon not a sprint

00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:57,549
you should probably look into the case

00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:59,409
of slow programming really cool and if

00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:59,970
we want to do research we need to give

00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:02,590
it time

00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:04,779
we need time to experiment we need time

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:07,750
to do research time to build simulations

00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:10,510
time to build you know toys that we can

00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,950
learn from often people focus on

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:17,409
features and we don't have the time for

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:21,399
that complexity is here to stay there's

00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:23,380
no way around this the systems of the

00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:24,789
future are going to be more complicated

00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,770
than the systems we have today

00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:28,659
there's nowhere around this we need to

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,320
understand how to build organizations

00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:32,809
how to train engineers that

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,169
can deal with complexity so thank you

00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,169
