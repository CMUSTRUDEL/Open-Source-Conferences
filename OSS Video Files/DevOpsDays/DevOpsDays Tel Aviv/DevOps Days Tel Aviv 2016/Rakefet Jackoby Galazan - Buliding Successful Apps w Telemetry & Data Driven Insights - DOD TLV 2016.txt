00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:42,330
before i do how many of you are familiar

00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:47,690
with the APM world how many of you use

00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,690
some sort of monetary recent application

00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:57,629
ok so Australia about the fact that the

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,519
company is today because whether it's

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,820
Australian here's the products with

00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,580
technology or they go digital currency

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,150
and provide their offer the offer learn

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:12,299
your services on their websites or your

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,210
mobile apps so their success becomes

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,140
more dependent on the success of the

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,420
applications and thus us as dev ops

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,930
teams have a growing responsibility

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,080
responsibility to create a successful

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,920
applications so what is the successful

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,340
application well we are all consumers of

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,829
applications so I guess everyone has in

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,439
its mind what expects to get from

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:44,100
application and waxman see makes it's a

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,109
successful for him or her but in essence

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,299
successful applications is one that

00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:51,719
provides value ongoing value to

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,659
customers as customers want to get on

00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:57,960
going you know capabilities the new

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,929
features all the time and these features

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,259
and capability will solve their needs

00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:07,140
needs that they have and that's not the

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,759
only important thing you need to provide

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,310
these all these capabilities and

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,460
wonderful things in a way that will be

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,010
easy for customers to consume and will

00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,800
be delightful for them to use so they

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,319
will continue to use your product in

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,940
your application and the reason it's so

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,150
important is because there is a lot of

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,120
competition out there and competitors do

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,069
more or less the same thing as you do so

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,680
if you don't provide the customers with

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,680
what with the value that they expect not

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,870
the value that you think that they need

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,950
or you provide them with crappy

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,969
experience they'll probably turn to the

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:48,980
competitors and you will lose their

00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:52,370
business so being successful requires

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,980
being data-driven to decision-makers we

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:58,010
must be able to know what our customers

00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,139
do with their product how they use it

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,180
what features they like what features

00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:05,510
they don't like what works well what

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,030
doesn't work well in addition to that we

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,120
must understand the performance of the

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,980
application and if it's available so we

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,980
will make sure that they have this

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,290
delightful and exceptional experience so

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:22,459
we must be able to detect issues as they

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:25,180
arise and resolve them before customers

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:25,180
are being aware of

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:35,070
but in today's a modern ins application

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:37,950
environment this is not an easy task and

00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,500
the applications we sat on multiple

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:44,120
components and tears whether it's a

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:50,580
servers or client VMs physical machines

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:53,730
cloud or on-premise ease on the first

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,440
part in third party services so it's not

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,380
only dependent on the application

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,370
performing it's all depending on the

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:04,980
services that the application is using

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:07,920
in addition to that as companies go

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,690
global the application is deployed in

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,180
different data centers around the world

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:15,630
it's being used by users around the

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,530
world using different devices verses and

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:23,100
browsers and if we as DevOps want to

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:25,380
update the application in order to bring

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,960
value to the customers then we are

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,640
implementing features all the time into

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,710
the applications the one that we believe

00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,990
will provide value to your customers and

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,760
we want to take out features that are

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,000
not working properly or we don't want to

00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:43,770
invest in any more and this is becoming

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,350
more rapid as companies they use the

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,510
continuous delivery methodology more so

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,510
although this is really great for the

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,970
business and for the customers it

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:57,390
creates the 82 causes the implications

00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:01,290
to be less stable than before but we are

00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,930
still as dev ops teams are expected to

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,930
quickly find and fix issues as they

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,930
arise then we'll study to understand

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:14,150
what's going on in all of this convex do

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:18,120
you know then it is in this limitation

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,550
so to sum of all if you want to make

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,750
sure that you are talking

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:27,110
she was able to answer questions like is

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:30,860
my application crashing is it fast

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,850
enough is it opposite down how many

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:37,300
people are impacted from the issues that

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:40,400
happening and you must be able to answer

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:44,330
these questions similar questions all

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,730
the time in real time so how do you do

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:54,320
that you know how do you make sense of

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:58,670
all this complex story so this is where

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:02,000
a PMA products come to the rescue what

00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:05,200
they do is they collect the APM again

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,730
its application performance management

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,350
these products collect telemetry from

00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,710
the different tiers and components of

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:15,140
the application from the web or from the

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,130
browser from back end video where

00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:22,040
infrastructure even monitors the users

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:24,050
they process this data and correlate

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,570
data that is relevant related to each

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,030
other and then provide you with

00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,820
sophisticated views and capabilities in

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,830
order to on one hand understand what

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,560
your users are doing any application and

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,560
on the other hand to allow you to detect

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,980
triage you diagnose issues and resolve

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,980
them quickly

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:50,750
so I want to discuss now what the type

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,120
of data that is collected by these a

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:57,440
Adrian product so you understand the

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,300
richness of the data that you can get so

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,910
on the Left you'll see a schematic view

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,039
of the application you see the users you

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:07,520
see the different clients that they use

00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:09,860
there's the application and a dependency

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,229
in this case it's the database the

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,280
platform and the infrastructure in which

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:20,599
the application is built so the first

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:24,130
stone type of data that is collected is

00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:26,570
the outside in monitoring where you can

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:31,099
check if your application is up or down

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:33,639
and these a products allow you to a ping

00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:37,370
test your application from different

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:40,690
areas around the globe usually down from

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:43,250
where because your customers reset and

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:47,860
now you check that your application is

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:50,479
up or down but this not okay not enough

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,150
sometimes because you would its

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,120
preferred and recommended to check

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,690
whether your main business say flows are

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,880
working properly so these say products

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:04,520
allow you to create more complex web

00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,310
test that you can you know build the

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,570
steps you mean business flows and check

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,539
if they are working properly or

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:16,280
performance as you expect and if not in

00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:20,210
both cases you'll be alerted the

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,240
secondary type of data is you know what

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,919
your users are doing in your application

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,699
what browsers they use whatever says

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:31,820
they use if it's a web web site with

00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:33,409
pages they are using what actions

00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,200
they're doing and what's their

00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,940
experience overall what they are going

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,780
into you

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,760
in your application the next thing is

00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,950
the actual activity in the application

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,650
it's the request the volume will request

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,480
the response time of the request if you

00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,910
have dependencies with the response time

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,890
of their dependencies if there are

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,650
failures in the requests you'll get the

00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:05,350
exceptions information you get logs and

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:09,160
traces and a similar and etc and well

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:12,160
you know we products cannot cover

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,260
everything so out of the box they will

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,080
provide you with a set of telemetry Oh

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:20,250
metrics is the day that these products

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,200
they collect but will enable you to

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,920
collect additional information that is

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,800
specific to your business so it's called

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,950
like custom events and you can miss you

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:36,490
can send the things like if your example

00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:38,920
an e-commerce site will able to send

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,950
information about different products

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,280
that are about you know how many how

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:48,400
much revenues customers are bringing in

00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,650
every day so any additional information

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,130
that is relevant to your business you

00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:57,310
can add as a custom event and last but

00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:59,860
not least its infrastructure so the cpu

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,860
utilization of memory and let's work

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,870
information so all of this for start

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,090
information from client to

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:10,180
infrastructure this is the type of data

00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:14,410
that you will be collecting from a

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,870
through the APM product so you're

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,330
probably thinking you know this is

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,970
probably a good products for a

00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:25,839
production and you will probably be

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:28,390
right but this product say provide value

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,050
even in the early stages of the

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:34,510
application development laser life cycle

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:38,250
whether it's planning development the

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,250
testing phase or the production phase

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:45,350
so first of all the planning you have

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,930
this see product let's say production it

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,360
monitors the application you are now

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,370
monitoring what the users are using what

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,129
day works properly what does it work

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,170
properly and you can then back put in

00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:59,240
your back lab all the items that are

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,870
related to the features that you want to

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,939
enhance and you want to invest in and

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,670
once you want to change your fix in

00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:10,519
addition to that you also know what the

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:13,220
issues that occurred and you were not

00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:16,009
required to fix because they were not p

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,750
0 but you do want to fix them in the

00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,790
next Julie so you put them as well in

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,000
the planning and now you have a backlog

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:25,759
for your next release which is

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,319
prioritize and is validated by data that

00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:32,629
this is actually the right investment

00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:34,220
the next phase is the development so you

00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:37,399
decided what you want to do what's the

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,009
right place to invest and so your

00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,470
developers go and develop you know the

00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:45,050
page is the request anything that is

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,730
relevant so this is the first the first

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,910
thing is that where you can actually

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:54,649
test and see that what you developed is

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:57,699
performance whether the page amidst the

00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:01,130
SLA of the low time whether the request

00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:03,680
takes a you know like if your essays two

00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:05,959
seconds if it takes two seconds or your

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,600
threshold is the bridge so this is

00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:11,870
really the first face that you are able

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,709
to understand and fix any performance

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:19,639
issues that you may have the next toe

00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:22,069
raises the system test or the like

00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:25,730
production testing phase where it's the

00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:28,670
first time that you actually test the

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:31,990
application end-to-end transactions end

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:34,480
to end and you can identify bottlenecks

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,490
where things are not working properly

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,670
between the integration points and where

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:46,759
the dependencies are not working and so

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:49,309
this is again then the last stage before

00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:51,980
production that you can identify and fix

00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:55,590
issues that are related

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:59,760
performance so you wouldn't want the

00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:04,170
customer to be the one that feels these

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,600
issues first now we're back in

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,810
production where you can monitor again

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,470
the what your customers are doing and

00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:17,120
you can now identify issues and fix them

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:25,290
before customers are being aware of them

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:27,120
and this in a quicken and manner so now

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,930
that we talked about what the type of

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,330
data is collected where you can use

00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:36,330
these APM tools just want to touch about

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:39,330
the capabilities and this the

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,510
visualizations that these products will

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,620
bring you in order to assist you

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:47,540
identify performance in availability

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:50,520
issues so the first and foremost a

00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:54,600
important thing that we as dev ops teams

00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:58,020
must be able to do is identify or detect

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,030
issues as they arise so these products

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,190
they provide you with a real

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,590
sophisticated visualizations their

00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,810
charts and dashboards that show you

00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:09,390
other main metrics is correlated

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:12,240
together so let's say that you want to

00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,580
check if your request performances say

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,790
valid if you have an issue you will be

00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:21,180
able to see correlated with that let's

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:23,400
say if the volume had a peak or whether

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,340
there were many failures during this

00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,250
problem of response time and so on and

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:32,790
so on we talked about web test before

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,920
that you can check and alert you on when

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,230
things are not working properly in your

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,170
main scenarios but these products also

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:43,710
allow you to create alerts on all the

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:47,040
matrixes that it collects so for example

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:51,150
let's say again that you have an SLA of

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,700
H Lhota let's say it's 22 seconds which

00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:56,910
is really long and you don't want to

00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:59,820
reach node is a threshold so you'll set

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,730
an alert let's say when the page load

00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,140
which is a second and a half and you'll

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:07,460
get notified and will be

00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:14,930
to fix this issue before you breach the

00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:17,310
the SLA that you about to so this is the

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:20,190
capabilities that we will allow you to

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:22,530
detect issues and now it's the part

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,960
where you need the okay I detected now I

00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:27,900
need to understand first of all its

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,140
severity or how urgent it is for me to

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:34,620
fix it and the second one is where

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:37,290
should I focus my efforts so the first

00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,570
thing is user impact when there is an

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,610
issue that arises these products will

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,280
allow you to understand how many users

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:47,040
are impacted by by this problem and if

00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:50,610
you don't have users let's say how many

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,490
requests or or any other metric that is

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:56,880
they important to you how how much

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:59,940
volume is impacted by this issue and the

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,260
second thing is we call it triage

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,750
because it's a term used in hospitals in

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,060
ER where a patient comes in and say I'm

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,010
not feeling well first of all you need

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,600
to understand you know the priority

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,780
there are a lot of patients you need to

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,840
understand who you need to tend to first

00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:21,090
and the second is you need to know you

00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,340
know to focus where where they issue

00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:28,370
reason which doctor to broom witch

00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:32,460
doctor to bring so the one of the cool a

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:35,580
but coming back to the application one

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,440
of the cookie abilities is a an

00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,840
application map where there is a

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,300
visualization of all the components and

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,700
you will you know in one glance you can

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,640
see which you know the health of all the

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:50,070
components so if there is a problem in

00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,190
one of components will not be green as

00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,500
you see here it will be red or in

00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,880
warning sign and you will you will know

00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,830
that you need to focus your efforts

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,130
there so you don't need to look at all

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:04,290
these charts everywhere to see you know

00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,870
to know where you need to focus you just

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:09,300
go to this map you understand this is

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,100
the problematic component and I need to

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,539
drill down there to understand better

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,100
what's happening

00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:18,100
and last but not least is the

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,600
Diagnostics part where now you detect it

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,319
you understand what you need to focus

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,689
your efforts and now you need all this

00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:29,049
data that is you collected to understand

00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:31,989
how to resolve it what's the you haven't

00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:34,659
exceptions if you have failures that you

00:17:31,989 --> 00:17:37,179
created and so if you are created good

00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:38,830
exceptions that explain what's happening

00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,379
you will be understood be able to

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,059
understand what the issues there you

00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:44,619
have the dependency so if you're calling

00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:49,179
independence you will have information

00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:53,320
about that even up to the time you have

00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:56,909
a sequel database or Raquel you will be

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,619
able to go into the actual sequel query

00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,149
if you have fairies rule and understand

00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:04,119
but the failures that are associated

00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:06,789
with it and sometimes even to the actual

00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:11,559
code to understand where in the code the

00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:14,559
problem is but all this is great and you

00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:17,470
know you but you need to go into the

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,559
product in order to identify in order to

00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:23,349
try hours in order to diagnose so the

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,229
latest their capabilities enhanced

00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:29,169
capabilities these products provide is

00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:32,739
what we call proactive detection or

00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:35,529
anomaly detection and it's using machine

00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:39,879
learning algorithm and data mining where

00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:44,190
all the data that is collected is being

00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:47,019
game undergoes a this machine learning

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,769
it studies the behavior of the

00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:53,979
application and creates baselines and

00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:56,590
once it identifies that there is

00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:59,830
abnormal pattern going on or is a

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:03,239
disruptive trend or something that is

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:07,779
not a behavior according to the baseline

00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:10,320
then it will provide a the detection it

00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:13,059
will send your detection automatically

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,289
via whatever you decide whether it's

00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:19,690
email or SMS or whatever form you want

00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:22,450
to receive it

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:25,049
and it's not only detect it's also

00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:29,919
provides all the relevant information

00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:31,659
that specifies this problematic area so

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,960
all the correlated data in order to

00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:37,929
triage and I issue so you don't really

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,120
need to go in and try to find all the

00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:45,429
data that you need in order to to

00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:48,389
resolve the problem so everything in one

00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:51,250
place with proactive a detection and

00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:54,700
depending on the product you need to

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:57,700
configure customized or teach the

00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:02,320
algorithm so it's not something these

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:05,649
cross the board so if you need to take

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,440
something out of this say a presentation

00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:11,110
is to be data-driven decision makers

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:14,250
because this is the way that you create

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,250
successful application

00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,620
any questions

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,120
yes

00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:43,909
it's proactive detection and I'm talking

00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:49,359
in general because I'm not talking about

00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:51,859
a specific a product here it's just

00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,419
there are all kinds of algorithm there's

00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:56,259
a normally detection there are trends

00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:58,789
analysis so all of these they a

00:20:56,259 --> 00:21:00,499
algorithm what they do they take all

00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:04,460
this data in the process and they learn

00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:07,249
the behavior over time of these matrixes

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,919
and they create a baseline and now when

00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:12,710
something is going wrong or is abnormal

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,960
to what is the baseline is they just

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,429
notify you that there is an issue and

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,309
they provide you with additional

00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:24,619
information that classify they say you

00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:27,039
know problematic area that is answer

00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,039
your question

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:41,769
it's something that again every product

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:44,980
it uses the a sometimes its proprietary

00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:47,019
algorithms or other tools so as I'm not

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:51,909
talking about a specific product here I

00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:57,210
can't read the answer i know i need

00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:57,210
