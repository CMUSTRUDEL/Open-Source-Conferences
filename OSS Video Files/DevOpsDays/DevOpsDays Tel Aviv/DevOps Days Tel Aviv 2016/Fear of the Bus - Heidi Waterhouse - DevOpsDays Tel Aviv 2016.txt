00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,089
travel around to development DevOps and

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,379
other conferences to talk to you about

00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:14,509
how you're getting everything wrong

00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:16,129
because it turns out when you get it

00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,560
wrong it comes down on me and I don't

00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:22,610
love that I'm super lazy this is really

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,430
what's going on so fear of the bus is a

00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,830
joke and I t where we say does your

00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:32,629
company go under if one person gets hit

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,730
by a bus if your build engineer is run

00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:37,670
over by a bus or wins the lottery which

00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,289
is the less gruesome alternative do you

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,960
have what it takes to keep the company

00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:44,359
going because lots of times people do in

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,489
fact have one person so key that they

00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:47,989
are heavily life insured and it's just

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,989
enough insurance to shut the company

00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:52,789
down like that's a real thing that

00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:57,289
happens but we don't have to be like

00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:59,719
that we could do better so there are a

00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:02,420
lot of reasons that a person may become

00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,579
unavailable they may have personal life

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,860
issues they may get sick they may get

00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:08,570
hit by a bus and also there are lots of

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,180
reasons that you can have some kind of

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,549
problem reaching each other you could

00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,350
have a natural disaster you could have

00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:17,960
some kind of massive IT outage that

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,939
never happens to us anything could

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,009
happen and you need to be able to pick

00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:27,560
up and run with wherever something has

00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:29,240
dropped and because I do documentation

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,219
and a bunch of different companies I

00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,880
know that DevOps people are always

00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:38,000
running as fast as they can to keep just

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,189
up with with staying in pace like you're

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,680
just running as fast as you can and you

00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:45,049
don't have any time to waste doing

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,270
documentation or any other niceties like

00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,939
that and I understand that and that's

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,439
why I come in and do what I do which is

00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:55,850
help people who don't have any

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,909
documentation but it turns out that

00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:02,119
human memory like Ram is volatile

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,439
storage even if you get someone to write

00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:05,060
something down they put it in there

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,579
super messy wiki how many of you like

00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,849
how your wiki works like are you using

00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:13,239
your wiki yeah can you find things in it

00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:13,239
the first time

00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,920
but people will put things in their wiki

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,850
and then they'll give you a pointer to

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,790
it but if you lose that person then poof

00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,670
all of the pointers to your information

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,470
are gone and you can never get that back

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,940
like you could search the wiki and you

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,430
may be able to find the information if

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,930
they wrote it down but more likely the

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,010
most recent stuff is actually in their

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,030
head and they haven't done anything

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,830
about that so when we think about

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,410
redundancy I always think about

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,840
suspension bridges each of these cables

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,070
is actually several cables coiled around

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,870
each other there's actually some really

00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,450
cool YouTube videos on how they make

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,670
bridge cables they have special coiling

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,040
machines but if any one of the wires

00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,480
that makes up these cables that and any

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,790
one of the cables that makes up the

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,590
bridge goes out the bridge doesn't fall

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,110
down immediately that's the whole

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,270
concept of redundancy I think a lot of

00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,490
times when we talk about redundancy we

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,710
talk about it in terms of servers and I

00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,270
think that's actually a less useful

00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,650
metaphor because it's really the

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,250
structure of the company that we're

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,510
talking about so here are my core

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,660
principles for doing DevOps

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,940
documentation everyone has to be able to

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,510
touch the documentation I've been doing

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,860
technical writing a long time I've had

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,780
technol writing tools that are like

00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,940
sacred and secret and special and you

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,310
only get like four licenses in the

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,260
entire company and it's all stored in

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,440
like an executable format and you can't

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,150
even dip it right don't use that tool

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,360
for your internal documentation that's

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,490
the wrong choice the next thing is that

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,890
content matters more than presentation

00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,890
don't spend any time making it pretty

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,680
not any like maybe maybe I'll let you

00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,630
put a heading in but I don't care if you

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,880
spelled it wrong unless it's actually a

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,770
machine name I don't care if you

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,990
formatted it I don't care if you put at

00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:08,350
alexs in I just want to make sure that

00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:11,320
the content is there and the last thing

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,320
is that Doc's reduce burnout the more

00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,870
times you interrupt someone the less

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,670
flow they have in their life and flow is

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,350
one of the things that makes us happy

00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,880
it's one of the things that makes us

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,400
feel like we're being productive in our

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,910
job is to actually be rolling along and

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,110
accomplishing things and

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,870
every time someone asks you a question

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,340
you have to drop all the processes that

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,790
you were working on in your head like

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,560
remembering where everything was and

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,510
remember something new and related to

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,340
them and then you're just left with this

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,910
pile of processes at your feet and

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,010
you're like right okay where was I maybe

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,510
I was getting some coffee that seems

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,310
like a great plan so you lose a lot of

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,650
time whenever someone interrupts you

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,260
with a question so the more docs that

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,870
you can put in where somebody else can

00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:01,310
find it the less irritated you're going

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,840
to be so I said those were the core

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,640
principles but here's the thing that I

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,080
want you to remember when you are

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,960
thinking about whether or not you want

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,210
to write something bad data is worse

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,170
than missing data getting something

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:17,210
wrong is worse than not doing it at all

00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:20,180
like I'm sure you all have a painful

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,730
example from your early sis ad mainly

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,040
days where you took something down by

00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:28,040
being wrong instead of just leaving it

00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,220
alone for somebody else to do missing

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:36,800
data although not as bad as bad data is

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:39,680
still bad ugly data saves lives it does

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,390
not have to be beautiful to save lives

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,550
it doesn't have to be beautiful to save

00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,880
your company you just need to have it

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:50,720
there so I don't care what it looks like

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,750
I just want it there so there are three

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,990
categories of data that as DevOps in

00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,690
particular you're dealing with there's

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,030
data that's automatable there's data

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,160
that's structural and there's data

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:08,810
that's secret so let's talk about how we

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,240
address these automatable data you want

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,220
to write down how to build a server the

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,600
first time you do it as long as you

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,060
think you got it more or less right and

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,669
then you want to automate it because you

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,500
never want to have to read documentation

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:24,140
on how to build a server do you do you

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,500
like doing that no I don't like doing

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,000
that either and i'm pretty sure that

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,100
your future self would really appreciate

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,770
it if you just made it a script so

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,539
anything that can be automated you need

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,190
to automate as soon as possible and

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:39,470
there are a lot of arguments about

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,689
whether or not that's optimal whether or

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,639
not

00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:43,049
you're using your time wisely by

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,239
automating which takes a little longer

00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:47,580
rather than just doing it the one time

00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:50,219
you probably have a feel for that like

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,459
this is a one-off or this is going to be

00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:55,559
something I have to do every week I

00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:58,799
think of automation as teaching your

00:06:55,559 --> 00:07:00,779
kids how to do chores I have a 13 year

00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:02,999
old and a 12 year old and I have still

00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,889
not gotten them to scrub a pan properly

00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:06,119
like we've got the dishwasher thing we

00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:07,979
got the sweeping thing we got the

00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:10,949
bed-making thing scrubbing pants is

00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:12,629
evidently super hard um I'm going to go

00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,899
home after two weeks away and the

00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:18,149
kitchen will be a nightmare but if I

00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,669
spend the time now to teach them how to

00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:23,039
do these chores like sweeping then

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,169
that's less work for me I've now made a

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,239
child processes that go out and do these

00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:32,309
things for me so every time you think

00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:34,139
about yes yeah literally you want to

00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:38,249
think about it in the same way can I

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,989
make this process you know run on its

00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,360
own so I don't have to think about it or

00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:44,699
at least so I only have to remind it and

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,749
not do it that would be lots better than

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:50,939
doing it myself the next category of

00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:52,709
things is structural and there are two

00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:54,869
kinds of structures one is the

00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,759
organizational structure of what you put

00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:59,969
your documents in and that means

00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,610
basically like this is a build script

00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:04,289
these are all the build scripts this is

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,879
a bug report these are all the bug

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,569
reports you just want to group like

00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:12,239
kinds of information together the second

00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:14,489
kind of structural thing is a template

00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:18,599
and templates are super nice because

00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:22,139
they really require a lot less cognitive

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:26,459
load so here is a jira board aren't we

00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:29,899
all excited yes JIRA is super complex

00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:33,089
but you know what it's not it's not

00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:34,829
thought provoking you just need to go in

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,029
and check off all the right boxes it's

00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:39,300
not like you have to write out

00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:42,750
paragraphs of and this is user visible

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,919
and this is in 6.1 and this is you don't

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,899
have to do that you don't have to

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,480
remember what you're supposed to include

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,819
in the bug all you have to do is check

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,970
the boxes that define what categories

00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:56,310
the bug is in so even though

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,019
we don't love doing this it's a lot

00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,910
better than writing a free-form bug

00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:04,439
report that had to include everything

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:06,959
that we put in a jira ticket the other

00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:09,569
thing that we want a document as sort of

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,819
a template is our workflow because we

00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:14,459
want to say this is the predictable way

00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:16,980
things happen so that when it fails we

00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:18,769
know what point it failed at and I know

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,500
you do this with monitoring your like

00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:24,600
packet packet packet explosion packet

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,019
packet okay I know where the problem is

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:33,810
you need the same kind of thing for what

00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:35,850
you're doing every day and so what you

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,459
want to do is make things into a punch

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,529
list so that again you're just checking

00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:43,079
things off instead of having to manually

00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:45,480
generate pages of thought so if you

00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:47,910
terminate someone you have to cut their

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,490
last check and you have to notify

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,709
insurance and you have to lock them out

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,019
of the system and you don't want to

00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:56,939
forget any of those steps so if you make

00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,240
it into a template and into a workflow

00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:01,559
you're going to be a lot better off and

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,660
if you don't store structural

00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,360
information in a place where people find

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,790
it they're going to do ad hoc work and

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,319
stuff is going to get missed and the

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,779
last thing about templates and this is a

00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:14,790
bitter experience speaking you need to

00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,350
keep a clean copy someplace where no one

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,449
else can find it because it doesn't

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,300
matter how much you file lock it and

00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:22,920
Mehmed do not overwrite somebody will

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,050
overwrite your template with their

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:29,639
information because I don't know humans

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:31,079
are terrible the third kind of

00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,660
information that you need to keep is

00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,309
secret information and this is the sort

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,110
of thing that we are least inclined to

00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:38,939
write down because it's scary to have it

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,730
written down this is the sort of thing

00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:43,319
that we don't want other people to know

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,750
but it's also exactly the sort of thing

00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:48,720
that we haven't told anybody else and if

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,930
we get hit by a bus they're kind of out

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,790
of luck so if you work for a bigger

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,459
organization you probably have a

00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:00,420
security team that handles like threat

00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:02,370
monitor mall threat modeling and other

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,319
kinds of like how you should store

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,790
certain types of information and they've

00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,740
sent you a memo which you haven't read

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,000
you can go find it on your share

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,570
which is where they always want to put

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,780
these things but I don't know sharepoint

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:20,910
um but you can also do this on your own

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:24,120
you could think to yourself what happens

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,640
if this data is lost forever like if

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,670
nobody knows this data how bad is it for

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,970
the company what happens if the data is

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:36,960
found by good actors like what happens

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:40,650
if somebody in my company stumbles

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,450
across payroll well that's not ideal but

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,600
they're not likely to like sync your

00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:48,630
company and finally what happens if the

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,790
data is found by bad actors like what if

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,220
a malicious person gets ahold of this

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,820
data answering these questions helps you

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,440
define where you're going to store it

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,860
secret information needs to be

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,240
documented because we need to be able to

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,280
use it and replicate it so what happens

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,390
when you fire the one marketing person

00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,590
who knows the login for the website do

00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,600
you know how much money you have to pay

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,010
your hosting provider to convince them

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,830
that you're the real person who has

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,750
access to this website it's a lot and

00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,360
also you still don't have any of the

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,310
source files so that's super painful and

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,040
that's a tiny example what happens when

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:32,730
you lose say your microsoft support

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,530
contract again super expensive and

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,940
painful so you have to make sure that

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,560
you're storing this stuff somewhere that

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,120
everybody can not everybody but

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,380
somewhere that approved people can get

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,330
to it so no matter what kind of

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,480
information you're documenting it needs

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,490
to have these three virtues it's got to

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,590
be findable people have to be able to

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,990
locate it wherever you've put it and

00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,130
it's got to be usable it's got to answer

00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,290
the question that they're actually

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,360
asking as opposed to like the question

00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:03,360
you think that you might have had when

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,550
you started a job ten years ago and it's

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,500
got to be current because there is

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,990
nothing worse than running a script that

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,700
says current build procedure and then

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,650
finding out that script is two years old

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:17,880
and we're all actually using new build

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:19,500
procedure and not that that comes from

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,560
personal experience but it totally does

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,930
so

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,220
so you have to make sure that all of

00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:29,620
your data follows these three core

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,600
values you know what I don't care about

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't care if it's pretty I already

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,390
said that I don't care if it's fancy I

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,760
don't care if it looks nice as a PDF

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:42,010
that's not important I don't even care

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,450
if it's friendly and easy to use like if

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,550
the only way you can get the

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,040
documentation out of somebody is to let

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,320
them write this huge long paragraph

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,300
without any paragraph breaks I don't

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,250
care at least you can find it at least

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,300
you can use it you can talk to them

00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:00,010
later about their poor grasp on language

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,410
so you need to be collecting this data

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,180
but that's hard I understand that

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,710
because I spent a lot of time sitting on

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,970
people's desks and reminding them that

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:11,410
they were going to get that to me last

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:13,060
week would you like a cookie so it

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,110
doesn't just mean telling people that

00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,300
they should write down what they're

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,980
doing it means making it easy to write

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,960
things down and giving them a place

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,550
where they could just drop things

00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,630
without thinking about where to put it

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:28,750
and it means a cultural change about

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:32,170
expectations so instead of saying hey

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,490
would you document this you say hey this

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:37,150
isn't finished because it's not

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,800
documented it's a difficult change for a

00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:42,790
lot of us but I think it's super

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,260
important to do so the first thing I

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,030
suggest people do when I come into their

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,470
company is do a documentation audit

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,940
because it turns out most people have a

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:53,020
lot more documentation than they think

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,790
they do it's just some random place so

00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,680
when you're doing a documentation audit

00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:02,410
you figure out what you already have and

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:05,470
where it is and then you do analytics

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,930
you can install google analytics on

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,640
almost anything like even internal stuff

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,100
you can install google analytics it's a

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,750
little weird but you can do it you need

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,400
to know what people are actually looking

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,839
for and the only way you're going to

00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,170
find that is by looking at the search

00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:25,200
terms so setup analytics let it run for

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:27,250
a little while see what's happening yeah

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,420
collecting information doesn't have to

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,430
be about writing a lot of new

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,589
information it's finding the information

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,360
that's already out there and I guarantee

00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:35,459
you somebody

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,320
has written some key network principle

00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:41,160
on a post it note and stuck it under

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,959
their keyboard because that's just how

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,390
it happens so all you have to do is

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,670
figure out who exactly is the posted

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,990
fiend and look under their keyboard and

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:52,320
find that information and put it

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,540
someplace better they also keep it in

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,250
their personal folders and on the desk

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,810
tops of their machines I don't know why

00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,240
people like to store stuff there because

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,800
it's extremely volatile but they do

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,690
there's like people who have just

00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:08,790
desktops full of documents on how to run

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:12,600
things so you need to figure out what

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:16,110
tasks you're trying to perform like AWS

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,760
went down oh crap what do I do now right

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,800
you need to have some documentation for

00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,769
that so you want a punch list of the

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,160
things you do like call ad find out if

00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:27,450
AWS is down for everyone or just me

00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,700
that's like the first item on your punch

00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,529
list you need to have a list of the

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,480
people who are responsible for this kind

00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:36,480
of problem so that you can call and wake

00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,120
them up you need to have a workflow for

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,240
how you're going to fix it you need to

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,829
have support info for AWS hello you

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,690
appear to be down in AC one again and

00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:52,860
you need to have the dependencies that

00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:54,690
this task has so if rebooting something

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,070
means that you not only have to start

00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,829
the server we're talking about but also

00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,449
like this ancient Sun machine you need

00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:02,820
to write down that dependency because

00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:06,660
otherwise it will get missed in a moment

00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:11,189
of crisis so finding stuff finally stuff

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:14,010
is not easy I really recommend the one

00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:16,559
long document method for DevOps

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,660
documentation it's super ugly and it is

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,089
not at all tech writing best practice

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,520
but you just put stuff at the top and it

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,260
Scrolls down and hopefully like you

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,540
scroll stuff off the bottom when it

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,460
stops being right because if you have

00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,950
any DevOps procedure that lasts longer

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,390
than a year i'm frankly astonished so

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,429
you should just archive the stuff at the

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,590
very bottom just put it on there because

00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,809
you know what we have searched and we

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,550
could just look for it and it makes it

00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,770
so much easier because there's one

00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:46,740
bookmark that everybody knows they can

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:52,240
either go look for stuff or put stuff in

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:55,060
super straightforward we think of search

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,460
as sort of a miracle but one of the

00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:00,730
reasons it works is because we have

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:04,360
learned to index in our minds so up

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:08,890
until about five years ago what do you

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:11,440
call this up until five years ago you

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,840
could not search microsoft site for the

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,820
phrase blue screen of death even though

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,000
that's what we've all called it for 15

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:22,000
years but it didn't occur in their index

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,850
so you have to be using search terms and

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,490
and keywords that are actually what the

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,160
people you are working with use so if

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,560
you called this a fatal exception error

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,300
you would never find it and you would

00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,120
never find the fix that lived with it

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:41,500
you had to know exactly what your error

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,660
number was so you know think about what

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,330
you're putting in so that people can

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,850
search on it I think 10 plus years of

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:52,390
gmail has essentially ruined our minds

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:53,710
for anything but search but the reason

00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,390
that gmail works is because

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,940
theoretically we've read most of those

00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:03,460
emails and we have an idea what the

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:06,070
keyword we're searching on is so 18 f is

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,350
a part of the American General Services

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,830
Administration which sounds super boring

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,600
and is in fact but 18 f is this adorable

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,520
little startup embedded in the

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,120
government and they do a lot of really

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,300
innovative technology things so when

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,450
they use slack what they do is somebody

00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:28,570
says oh hey here's how to and they write

00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,570
it in chat and then they or someone else

00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:34,840
puts a unique emoji next to it that says

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:37,690
we should capture this data so then you

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,150
can automate going through your slack

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:43,480
and pulling out anything that's next to

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:46,420
little cactus emoji and putting it in

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,360
your documentation or wherever you want

00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,980
to have it I actually gave a part of

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,960
this talk at another conference and I

00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,570
ran into the guy who wrote this the hue

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,760
bot that does this so when I release my

00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,040
slides his name is Mike bland when I

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,580
release my slides it there's a github

00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,899
repos

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:07,029
satori to the hue bot that will do that

00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:10,870
so hey value add so information has a

00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:14,260
shelf life it goes bad it goes bad much

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:17,799
faster than you think it does it gets

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:20,559
rotten and we need to remember that

00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:23,620
we're essentially serving up rotten milk

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,870
whenever working people old data if I

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,059
could do it I would tag all information

00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:31,570
with a date and when it exceeds a

00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:33,429
certain age it just gets tossed but

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,769
that's problematic for a lot of reasons

00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:37,510
so instead and if I say this is it

00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:40,830
enough conferences someone will make it

00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:44,320
for me I want a confluence plug-in that

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:47,470
gradually ages the text from black to

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,179
white so that by the time data is a year

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,440
old is nothing but white on white and if

00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,200
you want to use it you have to highlight

00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,870
it should be relatively trivial but

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,210
nobody's written it for me yet because I

00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,070
want people to know instantly without

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,769
looking at a date at the top which we

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,389
never do or without like running it and

00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:10,210
then failing which we do all the time

00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:12,130
the data is old and useless I have a

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,070
whole nother talk about how keeping data

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,600
is expensive and increases our security

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,149
threat surface but I'm not going into

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,860
that today what I am going to say is

00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:22,870
that if someone like a new hire is

00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,659
looking at your internal documentation

00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:30,309
you want them to have the new stuff and

00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:32,200
not the old garbage all of the hardest

00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:33,820
problems in computers are people that's

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,880
what you keep hearing in this room over

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,789
and over again and I think it's true so

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,760
I want to tell you that testing is for

00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:46,510
everyone and here's how you know if you

00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:49,269
got your DevOps documentation right you

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:52,299
heard of the chaos monkey Theory where

00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:55,419
you take a server offline take a person

00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:57,309
offline say hey you had a really rough

00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:58,720
night give me your pager give me your

00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:02,019
work phone we're not going to call you

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,010
we are I guarantee it not going to call

00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:09,460
you and then see what breaks because as

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:11,980
soon as you take somebody off pager

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,200
rotation the thing that only they know

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:17,800
how to fix will break

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,330
and true story and then you will know

00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,460
whether or not you have documented that

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:25,120
adequately to survive their actual

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:29,050
absence because you will know you've had

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,560
to look it up never call someone in the

00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:35,440
hospital you should like this should be

00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,990
obvious but it's some sadly not true I

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:43,420
know people who have gotten ups calls in

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:47,230
the hospital right and so if you test

00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:48,400
under load but not under pressure then

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,040
you're going to know whether or not you

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,300
could survive under pressure when Maria

00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,890
is in the hospital and you would better

00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,380
not call her because she has much busier

00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,390
than she cares about to deal with you so

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,460
if you do this testing in advance in

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,230
little iterations in little pain points

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,890
it's so much better than a catastrophic

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:08,350
failure because DevOps docs save you

00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,630
time and they save you money and they

00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,220
save you from having to put up a picture

00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:16,120
of the Hindenburg where you're up time

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:18,760
stats used to be so if this talk was too

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,700
long in you read Twitter instead write

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,580
it down because that's easier and safer

00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:29,470
than remembering it and if you want more

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:31,750
specific answers i'm doing a what do we

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,820
call it open space thank you i'm doing

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,980
an open space and you can come ask me

00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,480
about your specific problem and i will

00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,690
give you an answer and also my business

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,690
card
