00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,200
welcome to the session cold there's an

00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:14,240
after that when every team has their own

00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,119
tools often more than one and why this

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,890
is a delightful abomination that should

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,039
never ever happen and yet always does

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:26,779
what am I talking about well what I mean

00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:29,589
is you know if your company had 27

00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:32,140
customer relationship management tools

00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:35,660
would anyone have a problem with that

00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,330
okay good yeah the correct answer is yes

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,470
they should and at least one person and

00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,480
the person who should have the biggest

00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,270
problem with that is the one writing the

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,840
check for 27 tools at all do the same

00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,790
thing imagine 27 tools that do customer

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,010
relationship management in each one is

00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,680
sort of custom crafted to do exactly

00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:57,620
what a small slice of five people needed

00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,680
to do but that's it that's crazy and yet

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,240
and I see we see this all the time and

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,690
that's what we're talking about how that

00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,190
happens and how we make it go away now

00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,860
before i get into it a little bit of

00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:13,310
introduction about me my name is Liana

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,050
Donna I'm in a nightie for 30 years 20

00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,140
of those have been focused on borrowing

00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,810
everything from Tivoli w to see a to

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,300
shape and to nagios to my own little

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,880
Perl scripts and stuff like that yeah

00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,320
okay yeah that one too I've done this in

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,510
really large environments like the

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,490
company's you see there and also I've

00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,510
done it for very very tiny companies

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,460
that you've never heard of again

00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,990
companies that defy any kind of

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,510
definition and you guys all know about

00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,850
that because this is Eva's I am

00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,220
currently the head geek yes that's

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,250
actually my title I took the job for the

00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,530
title only at SolarWinds and yes I do

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,990
get to wear a lab coat that's also why I

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,659
took the job i also have an incredibly

00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,100
restrictive legal team they made me put

00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,560
this slide up i'm not going to talk

00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,049
about it I do have a pile of swag in the

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,180
back corner t-shirts and luggage tags

00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,159
and if you want to ask questions I'm

00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,729
there to talk about but that's it I did

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,259
want to mention the pro logic is the

00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:11,329
integrators locally in Israel that

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,139
resells and helps to install that that's

00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:13,680
all I'm talking about there we go

00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:17,430
corporate stuff is over

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,530
um so you probably have seen a diagram

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,019
like this in fact if you were in Cory

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,819
Quinn's talk you saw one about this that

00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:25,530
was for docker now it might have been

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,109
dr. it might be monitoring it might be

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,909
version control but everyone has sadly

00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:37,200
seen something like this and it's a pain

00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:39,719
now why is it a problem uh the answer is

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,689
it's actually not not necessarily I'm

00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,879
not here to say complexity bad i'm also

00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,980
not here to say that if your design does

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,769
not fit on a three by five note card

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:54,049
it's to complicate the fact is what we

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:58,769
do is complicated it's not trivial and

00:02:54,049 --> 00:03:00,989
yesterday um I be shy gave a wonderful

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,620
talk about how things are sometimes more

00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,549
complicated than we even think a 5-line

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,650
Python script can be incredibly

00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:10,680
complicated if you think about it the

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,750
right way and then last month Kevin

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,930
Myers wrote an article on packet porters

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,720
neck about how simplicity is actually

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,609
bad for networks that complexity is

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,819
often creates a more robust in a better

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:26,459
network and that's great complexity can

00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,139
be very good if it happens by design but

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,629
sometimes it doesn't happen by design it

00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:34,049
happens organically and you all know how

00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:37,109
you grow things organically right that

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:40,319
is not soft serve chocolate ice cream so

00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:42,509
NIT things happen organically when

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,819
people choose not to think carefully

00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:48,989
about the choices or the changes that

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,519
they're making so the reason why this

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,650
happens comes down to really two main

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,229
things first of all there's fear of

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,609
conflict and the other one is lack of

00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:59,370
trust and that's what I'm going to be

00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,569
discussing now let's talk about fear of

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,729
conflict who are we afraid of

00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:04,229
conflicting with well you could say well

00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:05,819
management I don't want to have to deal

00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:07,229
with management that's true but we

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,930
really don't want to deal with anybody

00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:13,379
who's going to ask questions slow us

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,359
down or try to help that's really what

00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,759
we don't want to do so we end up trying

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,560
to make choices that you know get keep

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,989
us away from that kind of conflict

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,300
because otherwise we end up having to

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:25,710
answer certain questions like why didn't

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,940
you include this in the budget request

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,440
cycle what there

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,060
thinking so I could cut it from the

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,620
budget and crush your dreams and make

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,470
you a bitter shell of a human being

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,180
that's what they want or they say well

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,790
why didn't you the corporate solution

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,220
which by the way doesn't exist or is

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,800
years out of date or is woefully

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,430
inadequate why don't you put it up for

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,140
our FB are you frakking kidding me no or

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,660
why don't you use the solution that

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,400
Bob's team uses because co-owning a tool

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,650
is a delightful situation that we all

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,350
hope we get to do multiple times it also

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,690
Bob's team is the custodial staff it's

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,670
not an apples for apples situation so

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,650
that's why we have fear of conflict so

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,740
we don't want to have to deal with this

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,450
as far as lack of trust oh the other

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,330
thing about sorry the other thing about

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,950
this is that it can lead to having uh it

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,680
can lead to actually having duplicate

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,700
functions in this in the same company in

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,300
two different departments will talk more

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,730
about that later um lack of trust who

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,140
are we not trusting well we're really uh

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:30,300
not trusting anybody we don't want to

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,340
have to like get anyone else's opinion

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,050
that's really what it comes down to um

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,510
because they don't trust in his opinion

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,560
and there's a reason for that see we

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:43,350
know about our stuff we know what our

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,510
stuff does we know how it works right

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,430
and nobody else does why not because

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,919
companies don't hire duplicate teams

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,720
there's not another team of like just

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,419
like me doing what I do because that

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,190
would be redundant so if I actually did

00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,950
want someone's opinion and I don't but

00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,380
if I did want someone's opinion I would

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,690
have to teach them about what I do which

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,180
is tedious and painful and really boring

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,980
and again nobody does that so again we

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,450
don't trust that anybody else knows what

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,800
we're trying to do um now i just made a

00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,570
really good case for why we should all

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,120
go out and pick our own tools all the

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,100
time right and it's actually a solution

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,930
that scales really well the sphere of

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,880
conflict and lack of trust works when

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,650
you have an individual who goes rogue in

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,790
the department and uses their own tool

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,800
ever even though everyone else you know

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,690
and ones using evernote I want one note

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,760
everyone's using git I want to use it

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,470
doesn't matter that you have it all the

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,900
time it works for an individual in a

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,580
team teams and departments departments

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,620
in company its scale

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,520
infinitely this lack of trust and fear

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,009
of conflict works all over now it does

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,469
tend to lead to very bad decisions

00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:52,949
though it's a good choice in the short

00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:55,080
term for the small group after that you

00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:58,310
find you start to make you ask questions

00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,419
that are really not optimal for example

00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,310
how much can we spend without anyone

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,419
noticing this is never a question you

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,449
would ask if you want to buy good

00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,370
software right and yet I see this all

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,020
the time the companies especially

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,639
monitoring again that's my thing

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,840
monitoring they're saying well I really

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,520
don't want to have to ask people about

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,979
monetary so how can we just get a little

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,580
thing over here that right that doesn't

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:22,500
get you good monitoring how about what

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,819
will we know how to support now I could

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,530
make the obvious joke right we're a

00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,300
Linux shop we don't want to have to use

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,009
something on windows so you avoid any

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,800
tool that runs on Windows but you could

00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:33,120
just as easily say we're an Atari shop

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,409
so we don't want to run anything on

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,319
Amiga so we're not going to be using

00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:39,000
video toaster and man am i old okay does

00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,189
anyone know what I'm talking about at

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,889
all okay good thank you thank you so

00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:45,690
much so the the point is is that what we

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:49,199
know how to support whether it happens

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:51,270
to be a platform or it's a language or

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,379
it's a whatever that's a really poor

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:56,969
reason to pick a tool unless as charity

00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:01,229
had said it's part of the critical path

00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:02,669
or another one that I love what will run

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:05,479
on the spare laptop is sitting under

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:07,650
Bob's desk or on that vm that we never

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,539
decommissioned or within our existing

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,479
cloud allowance these are all choices

00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,830
that do not lead to these are all

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,289
decisions that do not lead to good

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,120
choices about tools and once again I

00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,889
focus on monitoring but again you could

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,690
say versioning or development or

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,180
anything else that gets you in the same

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,159
place and as I mentioned earlier it also

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,810
leads to this amazing situation where

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:30,870
two departments in different parts of

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:33,240
the company have the exact same software

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,099
under two different contracts I have

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,289
seen this they don't even know about

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,880
each other until the sales person says

00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,760
oh yeah I was just visiting your George

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,169
over there and I got it like you do you

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,680
could have been getting discounts this

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:50,459
does not fill me with glee and joy when

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,380
it happens and it happens a lot it also

00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:54,780
leads to the idea of a unit

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,490
now for those people who aren't sure

00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:00,090
unit Oscar is a term that was coined by

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:03,210
Alton Brown he's a Food Network USA Food

00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:05,640
Network person and he talks about such

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,920
delightful tools as the strawberry

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,420
slicer this is a tool that as the name

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,490
implies slices strawberry it does not

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,570
slice eggs it does not slice brew

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,790
berries it only slice the strawberries

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:20,430
now you could use you know a knife but

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,220
no you have a uni tasker's a tool that

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,260
does exactly one thing right or my

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,810
personal favorite the rolly now if

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:33,540
you've never seen this this has one job

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:36,180
it cooks an egg it cooks it into a round

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,730
vaguely obscene shape that tastes

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:42,000
disgusting this is what this tool does

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:46,340
it can't cook anything else besides an

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,270
egg it's horrible in every way so in i.t

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:52,530
unite laughs every time I look at the

00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:55,590
picture in IT a unit Tasker is a tool

00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:58,920
that does exactly one thing it may do it

00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:02,550
very well but it does one thing it fits

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,730
one use case it monitors exactly one

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,740
vendor is hardware one model of one

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,900
vendors hardware that's what a unit

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,060
Tasker does and it's never good it

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,060
always creates conflict and problem um

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:22,800
okay so not by coincidence DevOps is

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,680
designed to address among other things

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,560
two major dysfunctions among teams fear

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,570
of conflict lack of trust so let's take

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,240
a look at how a DevOps mentality a

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,470
DevOps culture can help with this now

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,170
one of the first things if you're going

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,150
to go down the path of reducing the

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,770
number of tools that all do the same

00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,910
thing the first thing is you have to

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,410
make sure that the team understands

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,960
there's actually a problem to solve

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,520
you'd be amazed at the number of times I

00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,400
walk into a group and they think it is

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,520
perfectly normal and natural to have 23

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,130
no I'm not exaggerating 23 different

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,020
monitoring tools that all have some

00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,190
layer of overlap but some of you are

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,870
laughing show of hands how many people

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,240
have seen this whether it's monitoring

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,930
or whatever right okay they think it's

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,279
natural all right again what's water

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,720
I don't know what you're talking about

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,550
so the first thing you have to do is

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,670
make sure they understand that yes it is

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:18,470
an issue the next thing that you need to

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:21,380
do ha is remember that the AI ni t is

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:24,410
for information not function not

00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,300
customization not pretty GUI none of

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,000
those things it's for the information

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:32,600
because at the end of the day what teams

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,040
really need is the data even if what

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,260
they're talking about is hey I need this

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,810
to execute this program they actually

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,420
don't need to execute this program what

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,000
they need is the data that says the

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,279
program executed and here's the result

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,560
or how fast executed or whatever it was

00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,839
they honestly in their heart of hearts

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,459
don't care what does the executing or

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,010
how it executes they just need to know

00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:57,709
that it happened it's the data so if you

00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:00,830
can get teams to focus on that then you

00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:05,720
have a bridge into reducing tools that

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:07,580
you don't need so this is a slide I'm

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,230
this but I'm going to use the actual

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:16,250
tool here this is a spreadsheet that I

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:18,260
ok let's see if I can do this though how

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:23,170
would I make this show on the other

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,170
screen I don't know ok I won't bother

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,770
not important now this happen to be a

00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,200
spreadsheet that I put together for

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,459
monitoring again it may not work for you

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,080
if you're trying to do version control

00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,630
tools or something else but this is just

00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,360
the way that I put it together once

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,830
again 23 tools wasn't exaggerating these

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,900
are all tools at a particular company

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,670
that I worked at that do some form of

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,320
monitoring so the first thing I did was

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,810
I listed the tools along the top and

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,640
then down the side I took a look at the

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:53,270
functions except it's not really the

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,700
functions it's really the it's really

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,920
the types of data that I'm looking at

00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,050
however it's collected this is what I

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,700
need and then I really just went through

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,740
and I started to click off the check

00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,890
boxes which of these tools do these

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,529
things or have this data available what

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,670
I was able to do instantly of course

00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:12,380
after the months of trying to collect

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,240
the information but what I was able to

00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,520
do was first of all see where i had

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,410
almost exact duplicates of function

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,889
where something was duplicated I was

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,269
also

00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:22,819
able to see where a tool did very little

00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:25,910
except one thing that was done by almost

00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:28,730
everything else hmm not sure we're

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,350
really needing that right now okay then

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,629
I took it a step further though because

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:35,839
even though I said don't worry about

00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:37,819
function the fact is that some tools are

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,639
easier to use some tools are cheaper

00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:42,769
some tools are more robust or whatever

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,559
it is so we began to identify the

00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:47,779
primary and i don't think i have on here

00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:50,239
the secondary and the tertiary the the

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:53,379
third level of the tool that we prefer

00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:56,720
to use for any particular datatype and

00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:58,819
i'm not saying that you should only have

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,220
one tool for everything because we all

00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:03,319
want a sanity check we all need to have

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,509
that you no other place to say does this

00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:07,309
match up at all but you know with this

00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:10,129
kind of information you know what you're

00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:11,419
getting into you know that you have 23

00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:14,269
tools you know that this one is

00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:16,489
completely unnecessary also at the top I

00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,949
was able to tally up all the check marks

00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:21,949
to see which tool actually did the most

00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:24,709
for me the biggest bang for the buck now

00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:26,749
that's not the only criteria but it was

00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:29,149
a way for us to assess you know for

00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:30,230
example you know if this tool and I know

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:31,999
it says solar winds and I'm not really

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,769
trying to make it a you know I'm not

00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:36,350
trying to do that if this tool was you

00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:38,149
know twenty thousand dollars a year to

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,009
support and this tool was eight hundred

00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:42,470
thousand dollars a year I might not be

00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:45,439
making up those numbers um you know then

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,989
I would know that maybe I'm not getting

00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:51,079
the value that I wanted for that tool

00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:53,449
set so that's you know another another

00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,790
thing to do so some kind of analysis

00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:58,160
that allows you to understand what your

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,480
environment looks at is the next step

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,480
because now you know who to go talk to

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,819
about reducing and you know why because

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,189
again what's what's it all about the

00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:09,019
information the data now you know the

00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:11,089
data that it prevent presents and so the

00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:12,799
the teams that consume that data you can

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:16,279
say oh I have it here and I have it here

00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,529
and I have it here one of the hurdles or

00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,089
one of the pitfalls that people get into

00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:21,859
when they try to reduce the complexity

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:24,410
of tools in their environment is not

00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:26,509
understanding the use case of the tool

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,799
now in my world where that happens the

00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:31,189
most is the difference between

00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,480
monitoring and management so I go into a

00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:35,600
team and I say hey

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,130
your tool XYZ does monitoring but you

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,600
don't need that because I have this much

00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,709
better tool that does it over here

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,329
except they don't use it from honoring

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,850
they use it for management they actually

00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:46,160
control the hardware or the software or

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,300
whatever it is I need to understand that

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,800
or I'm going to be in a fight that I'm

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,490
not going to win and it's not going to

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,589
help me however I can go in and say hey

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:58,160
I know you get this piece of information

00:15:54,589 --> 00:16:01,339
this data from your tool this management

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,500
tool that you use but I also have this

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,300
information can we compare because I

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,550
want to make sure that my tool is you

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,709
know that my tool or this other tool is

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,690
giving correct information or what the

00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:14,269
differences are you end up improving you

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,130
end up creating a better data set by

00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,570
doing that but you don't want to fight

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,550
this fight you don't want to try to take

00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,579
away something that has a use that isn't

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,620
what you're trying to reduce another

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,120
pitfall that people run into is having

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,100
to talk about money with people who

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,029
really like talking about money I mean

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,490
like the executives now this is and most

00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:36,500
IT people really don't like to talk

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,630
about money so I have to warn you that

00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,180
it's going to be necessary in order to

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,670
get this done I have a whole other talk

00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,829
I call it buy me a pony and it talks

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,420
about how we in the technology fields

00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:49,310
can get better at talking with business

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,880
people about it in ways that don't make

00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:55,490
them laugh at us or say no all the time

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,839
but here's the short version of it you

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:02,240
cannot win a converse at win approval

00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:05,059
with management by talking about

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,189
features or execution times or functions

00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:09,500
no matter how much you love them and man

00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:11,480
we love them right that's what it's all

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,970
about it works really well it's going to

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,760
save me hours they don't care about your

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,079
hours they never will the only things

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,510
they care about are three things you

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,939
have to make your discussion fit will it

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,459
help me increase revenue will it help me

00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:29,480
reduce costs or will it help me avoid

00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:33,530
risk that's it you have to make your

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:36,620
story match that one or more of those if

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:39,890
you do that you will escape from this

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,510
conversation relatively unbruised but if

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,860
you don't you're not going to have their

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,570
support and you're probably not going to

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,020
be able to get through it so that's

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,720
another pitfall

00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,400
another pitfall is using a word that

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,690
means the same thing even though it

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,900
means different things even though it

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:58,680
sounds the same does anyone here speak

00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:00,960
classical Chinese like a little no do

00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,690
you can you think can you read this like

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,760
just two lines okay so this is the this

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,380
is the fanatic version of it i won't i

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,660
won't put you on the spot um and it's

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,340
really she that's it she she a shoo shoo

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,750
shoo shoo you know that's what it sounds

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,020
like it is obviously different

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,090
characters it is obviously a completely

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:21,450
different story this is a Chinese a

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,190
Cantonese tongue twister okay so but it

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:26,400
sounds the same now what does that look

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,740
like an IT well in my world log

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,540
monitoring is my favorite you have that

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,800
inigo montoya a moment that word you

00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,290
keep using I don't know think it means

00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,420
what you think it means this is this is

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,800
my inigo montoya moment log monitoring

00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,490
because when people say log muttering

00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:43,770
they could mean syslog now syslog is a

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,660
very particular protocol that sends very

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,520
particular kinds of data in a very

00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,800
particular way it's lovely and wonderful

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,200
and extremely chatty and it could ruin

00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,850
your life but that's a different story

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,980
okay that's that but some people say log

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,110
monitoring and they mean Windows Event

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,060
log now windows event logs are also

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,250
wonderful but they aren't the same as

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,990
syslog they're completely different

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,510
things but people still say log

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,790
monitoring for it they could mean log

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,800
file aggregation now log file

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,590
aggregation might involve aggregating

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,750
syslog and or Windows Event log but it

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,660
is not those things it is something else

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:20,880
and they might say log monitoring but

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,560
what they mean is there's a file in this

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,990
directory over here on this machine I

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,880
want to look for the word banana every

00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:31,590
half hour right that's log monitoring

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:35,580
also all those things people indicate by

00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,620
saying she they say log monitoring it

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,960
doesn't mean the same if I'm on a

00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,570
campaign to reduce the complexity of a

00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,120
particular kind of tool set I need to

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,530
know when the same word is going to mean

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,390
multiple things because otherwise I'm

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,550
going to be in an argument that I don't

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,350
need to be in now here in dev ops this

00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,750
is one of my wonderful favorite pet

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,400
peeves APM application performance

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,990
monitoring it couldn't be simpler

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,580
application performance monitoring

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,010
except there's four different

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,360
you could mean it could beam and most

00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,480
people in the room i'm guessing when

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,310
they say a PM they mean code based

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,530
application performance monitoring that

00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,910
means how the code is executing and how

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,770
the transactions and it goes into the

00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,030
message jus and it comes out through the

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,250
stack and all instead of that's

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,660
wonderful but it bears no resemblance to

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,820
the application performance monitoring

00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:24,470
that I've done for 20 years which really

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:27,810
has to do with is exchanged running how

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:30,000
sharepoint is my blackberry server

00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,490
respond you know how's the application

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,980
it could be your custom application

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,800
which is for services to perf Mon

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,230
counters that's application performance

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,150
monitoring from what I traditionally did

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,470
the OP side it could also mean web-based

00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,360
performance monitoring which is really

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,850
just web transactions pingdom in all the

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,500
rest right how's my web performing or it

00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,090
could be database application

00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,210
performance monitoring so people say a

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,410
p.m. and I now have to ask them for a

00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,360
dictionary to figure out what they're

00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:00,390
talking about because if I say that I'm

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,640
trying to reduce or focus or improve the

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,110
APM capabilities it's going to mean

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,270
different things depending on who's

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:11,580
talking so let's say you've done it all

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,810
right you have made sure that the words

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,520
that you're using are clear and you're

00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,290
not confusing one term for another term

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,550
you have figured out a way to talk to

00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,560
the bean counters in a way that's

00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,930
meaningful for them you have used your

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,910
analytical skills to figure out where

00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,940
there are opportunities to reduce and

00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:30,390
then you go to the team and they refuse

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:35,180
to let go of her tool or even better

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:38,610
they demand another one what do you do

00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:42,180
you take it and you turn it you reframe

00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:44,640
it as a request for data goes back to

00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,410
what I said before reframe it and say

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,470
what's the information that you're

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,910
looking to acquire if you have it

00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,570
already and you should know you have it

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,490
already because you have that

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:56,190
spreadsheet or something like it you

00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:58,770
have it already then you tell them oh is

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,510
this what you mean and you present that

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,790
they can do a raw dump of the database

00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,490
whatever it means if you can do that

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,720
then what you're going to do is you're

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,040
going to show them that you have the

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,780
information they need and all they

00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,220
really need is the information you're

00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,020
going to present it to them you're going

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,299
to say now let's talk about how you want

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,759
to come

00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:18,100
soon this where does this need to get to

00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,350
you talk to the department or team or

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,999
whoever owns the source the originating

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,860
source of that data and you create

00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:25,779
collaboration between those teams so

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,519
that they can both consume the same data

00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:30,820
in ways that are meaningful for them

00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,980
that builds trust that reduces fear and

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,909
that gets you to an environment that is

00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:39,009
simpler and easier to manage completely

00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:41,440
unnecessary summary tools can

00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:43,149
proliferate without your knowledge a lot

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,659
of times they have it happens

00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:49,029
organically and um you know and it's

00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:51,070
something that you can fix it's not

00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:52,749
trivial to do it but it is possible it

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,480
will take time and you just have to sort

00:22:52,749 --> 00:23:02,770
of work around those pitfalls any

00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:08,750
questions excellent no questions whoo

00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:08,750
