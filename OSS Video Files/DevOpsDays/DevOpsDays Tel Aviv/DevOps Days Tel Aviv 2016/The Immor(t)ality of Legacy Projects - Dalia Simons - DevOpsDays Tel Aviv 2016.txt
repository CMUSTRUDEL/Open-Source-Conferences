00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:15,570
so I would like you to take a moment and

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,279
imagine the next scenario so you just

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,380
you just finish working on a really big

00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:22,689
project and you're meeting your boss to

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,909
get your next assignment and your boss

00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,640
asks you to maintain a legacy project

00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:30,369
how do you feel about it are you excited

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,890
are you full of joy so I'm going to take

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:35,140
a wild guess full of joy so I'm going to

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,440
take a wild guess that your answer is

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,199
probably not yeah we all know that

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,370
maintaining legacy projects is hard it's

00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:48,699
frustrating and generally we tried to do

00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:51,070
everything we can to avoid it so my name

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:55,899
is Dahlia I'm a server architecture

00:00:51,070 --> 00:01:00,730
twigs okay I mr. architect eight weeks

00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:04,330
and I currently own a legacy project so

00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:07,180
it's official name is the HTML mobile

00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,940
editor project but we all like to refer

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:12,790
to it as the old mobile so everybody

00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,690
will know this is old code it's no fun

00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,940
we don't like the way it's written and

00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,340
so the way I go this project I actually

00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,560
when I got it it was new and shiny so I

00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,780
just joined the company five years ago

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,330
it's just finished writing this project

00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,520
and I was handed it over and it was very

00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,250
exciting but then during the last five

00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,040
years suddenly became a legacy project

00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:39,400
and I started feeling the pain of having

00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,440
to maintain it all the time and i also

00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,780
got involved with maintaining other

00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,250
legacy projects that we have in a

00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,580
company and we currently have quite a

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:51,250
few of them and so it made me sing hey

00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,310
why do we have so many of them why do

00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,950
they exist at all and also can we make

00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,920
and maybe a bullet list or some

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,590
guidelines to how how we want to

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,970
maintain it so this task will be easier

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,950
is so today I want to share with you

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,320
some of my thoughts about it why we have

00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,630
those projects why I actually think they

00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,200
are important and why they don't die so

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:20,410
they are immortal and and also give you

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,590
some tips and suggestions from our

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:27,040
experience at weeks on how this task if

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:35,110
you ever get get it good for bid it can

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:38,020
be a big success for you so oh okay so

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:41,020
why do we have legacy projects where do

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:44,590
they come from so no one in his right

00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:47,260
mind sits around and says what am I

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,200
going to right now I know I'm going to

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,890
create a legacy project so this is not

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,380
how things work so it really all starts

00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,770
with an idea so someone has an idea for

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,080
a new project for new product maybe it's

00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,550
a product manager and maybe someone

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,610
starts if you start up with a new idea

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:09,730
and then it's a good idea it's a good

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,260
idea and designs ar.drone hundreds

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,620
thousands of lines of codes are written

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:18,400
and eventually the projects makes you to

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,350
production yay and so it's a successful

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,500
project and it starts getting customers

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,020
and over time new features are added to

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,330
it the project is extended and it

00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,490
becomes profitable so this is a very

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,130
important a point for me because

00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,530
projects that aren't successful and are

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,450
not profitable will just die there will

00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,370
not become legacy projects so the reason

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,680
we have legacy projects is because those

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,830
projects are making us money and we

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,520
don't want to kill them and so after a

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:51,850
while something happens don't know what

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,310
and we magically find yourself here

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,470
where we have a legacy project and the

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,590
question I was asking myself is what

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:02,440
happened here how did we go from having

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,930
a nice successful project to having this

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,600
legacy project and nobody wants to touch

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,610
and so I looked at all of our legacy

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,220
projects at wigs and I actually

00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,650
categorize it into three different a

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,700
reasons why we go to have a legacy

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,830
project so the first one it really has

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,290
nothing to do with us we have a great

00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:26,820
project our project is written very

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:29,190
nicely but somehow technology

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,650
has changed in the world and so the

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,200
technology that we were supporting isn't

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,260
relevant anymore and we have a really

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:41,910
great example for that so when weeks was

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:44,280
founded at 2006 flesh was the next big

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,680
thing in the internet world you could

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,620
make great website so you could have

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,720
great animations and so our founders

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,430
they had this great idea they were going

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,560
to create a start-up that's what he did

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,590
was an editor where you can make your

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,950
own flash site so we had this editor and

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,750
it was great it was working it was

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,670
actually quite a mature product and we

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,420
had a lot of customers and a lot of

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:14,750
subscriptions to it but then something

00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:17,640
horrible happened iPhone came out so

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,280
once the iphone came out and Steve Jobs

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,620
said you know what we're not having

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,900
flash in our iphones then suddenly this

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,750
great product product we had which was

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,300
really you know state-of-the-art wasn't

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,760
relevant anymore and so we had to do

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,790
something very very quickly so that our

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,220
startup one closed completely because we

00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:41,550
had a product for technology that no one

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:45,540
was supporting anymore and so we wrote a

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:47,310
new editor for creating html5 sites so

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,560
we did this very very fast because we

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,050
didn't want to get out of market but we

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,790
still had a lot of customers on our old

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,580
flesh editor and they were paying

00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,630
customers they're paying annual

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,970
subscriptions so they can have their

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,600
flesh site and they didn't move want to

00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,640
move to the html5 site they also wanted

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,740
all of those great features that flash

00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,560
head but we didn't have all of them to

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,080
start with our new editor and so our

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,780
flesh editor became a Legacy Project

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,970
which we still maintain up to this day

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,310
still has quite a lot of paying

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:24,780
customers still makes a company quite a

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,640
lot of money and money is good and yeah

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,670
it's going to be a point of this talk

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,920
that money is good a and so we have the

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,320
flash editor which is actually not a bad

00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,570
piece of code but it is now legacy so no

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,490
new features are added to it it's like

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,960
frozen and we are just doing regular

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,300
our maintenance on it but we don't

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,970
really add any new features date so

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,410
that's the first example and the second

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,660
one is what you're probably always

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:52,389
thinking about when someone says legacy

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,120
projects so it's this old bed written

00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,680
projects they are not fully tested is

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,190
there because there are written really

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,110
really fast or because when you wrote

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,729
them you didn't really have the concept

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,889
of writing tests or maybe you had only

00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:08,110
unicast but to do it today you do

00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:13,300
integration tests in to end test and

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:15,190
then it maybe it just doesn't look to

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,009
you today like it's tested enough at the

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,330
time it was fine and then the second

00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,870
thing is that they were never properly

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,250
refactored sore more and more code

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,569
accumulated but no one ever refactored

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,940
them and the code became very

00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:31,720
complicated which ended up in spaghetti

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,690
code and it becomes very very difficult

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,520
to add new features and components so

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,099
I'm actually going to continue my

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,719
example of a firm before and talk about

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:46,630
how we moved our HTML editor to react so

00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:49,180
as I told you we built our HTML editor

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,740
very very fast because we had to be

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,130
there in the market we had to get a

00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:57,909
product out and so it was written so

00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:01,060
fast that the code was one big mess so

00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:03,610
it was JavaScript code and after a while

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,349
i think it was I think a year after the

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,330
release we came to a point where

00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,699
whenever a product manager would come

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,219
and want to add a feature the answer

00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:15,699
would always be six months which is

00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:18,039
crazy for small features and they just

00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:22,659
realized that this this cannot work

00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:24,400
anymore and we have to rewrite it so

00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:26,710
this is the classic example we've

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,009
rewritten the whole editor so we stopped

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:33,070
working no new features on our I mean

00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:36,430
this is our major product and we've

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,529
rewritten it using react but we didn't

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,479
rewrite a project using react only

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:43,060
because react is cool and into the new

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,370
technology so we wrote it because we had

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:49,089
a real reason that we had to rewrite a

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:52,240
project and then the old HTML editor

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:52,620
became a legacy project and now I've had

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,839
some

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,150
we'll ask me before when I gave this

00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,460
talk why do we still have this old HTML

00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,800
editor if we move to the new one why

00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,440
didn't remove all the customers and the

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:08,460
reason is that it wasn't that easy to

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,470
migrate a all of the existing customers

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,700
so we are still in the process it's been

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,220
out for two years we're still in the

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,560
process of migrating and it's not always

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,339
that simple and I'll talk about it a bit

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,490
later and so we've really written it in

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,930
our great new HTML editor and so the

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,660
third reason i think is the most

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:30,180
positive one of them all is you're

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,370
writing a system and it's fine it works

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,339
and then suddenly it grows so much you

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,960
have so many new customers that it just

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,450
doesn't hold the load and the

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,980
scalability it needs to hold and then

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,470
you don't have a choice with making an

00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,650
architectural change and rewriting the

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,660
system so that you can actually hold the

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:53,220
amount of customers that you currently

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:56,100
have and so I this is the story of how

00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,279
we left magenta so a one of the things

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,080
weeks does is we give our customers

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,880
atoms they can put on their week's web

00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,830
sites they create for themselves and one

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,440
of the biggest one is an e-commerce

00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:10,440
solution so they can create our own shop

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,029
and sell their products and when we

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,000
first did it we wanted to get a

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,950
something out very fast so we found the

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,470
startup it's an Israeli startup it's

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,480
called magento a their code is written

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,959
in PHP and they have an e-commerce

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,640
solution and so we cooperated with them

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,279
they were very excited to have a big

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,230
customer like weeks and we actually

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,750
wrote our e-commerce engine on top of

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,230
their e-commerce engine but their

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,640
solution was really viewed for a website

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,529
that wanted to buy their solution and

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,110
run one store but we are writing

00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:45,270
handwritten stores and then a thousand

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,980
stores and then tens of thousands and

00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,740
when we go to a hundred thousand it

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,040
stopped working because the engine just

00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,860
wasn't built for such a big scale of

00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,600
sores and so we decided to rewrite it

00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:03,209
and we rewrote it in-house actually

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,260
using our own stack so PHP we actually

00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:07,870
have no projects in PHP in weeks we

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,310
only use it because of magenta and so we

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,470
took the opportunity to write it using

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:15,490
Scala which is what we write at weeks

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:17,590
and we also moved it to events sourced

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:21,430
so when we do like to use new

00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:23,200
technologies when we rewrite and because

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,820
we moved it to the event source and

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,750
because we moved from the magenta

00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:32,050
database that was very complex and built

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,510
for them the migration became very hard

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,690
to start with I think they estimated it

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,490
is in three months and two years later I

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,920
think we're just about ready to finish

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,840
the migration process so that's why we

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,020
still have the old e-commerce is another

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,960
one of our legacy projects so all of

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:53,350
those examples are why we find ourselves

00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:56,830
proud owners of legacy projects and

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:59,260
those projects are still alive because

00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,480
we still have customers to support and

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:07,320
especially because we still have paying

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:10,060
customers to support and and I'll

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,180
elaborate a bit more so we always strive

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,920
to migrate everything so eight weeks we

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,290
actually rewrite a lot of projects and

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,420
usually we think about the migration

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,360
when we start writing the prog they

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:25,240
start rewriting the project but it's

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,390
just not always that simple and a lot of

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,880
time it's also a matter of cost so how

00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,710
much will it cost you to migrate from

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,220
the old project to the new project and

00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:38,950
is it worth while the effort so a the

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,510
flash sites migrating them to HTML sites

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:44,470
because it's completely different

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:46,210
technology and it's very very hard to

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,700
actually migrate the side so it will

00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:52,720
look the same in the HTML from flash

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:55,000
then the effort was huge and I think the

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,560
only reason we actually started doing it

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,920
and we're actually now in the process of

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,530
doing that is because we felt like

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,450
really flash technology is going to die

00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,030
and we have to do something with those

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,790
customers but other word otherwise I

00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,100
don't think anybody would invest a that

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,020
amount of money in migrating users that

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,690
are using a system they are happy with

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,700
it they are paying every month they

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,380
don't care we actually blocked

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,660
the option of creating flash websites

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,420
and we still have a few tens of them

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:31,990
created each day people like it don't

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:35,110
know why hey yeah so you got a legacy

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:40,180
project its effect we know why and what

00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:42,880
are we going to do about it so the first

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,250
thing any one of us would really like to

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,030
do with this legacy project we inherit

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,730
an is rewrite because we are engineers

00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:55,150
and that's what we like to do so what we

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,130
really like to do is go the libby soul

00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:00,250
project we're going to rewrite it with

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:02,320
our favorite language with all the new

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,820
and shiny tools we can find we're going

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,870
to write it pearly we're going to write

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,960
it TVD this time so no problem with this

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:12,430
well rewrites are pretty expensive and a

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,900
lot of times we found herself with the

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,380
legacy project because it was also

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:22,480
already rewritten and nobody is going to

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:25,390
invest money in n resources to rewrite a

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,440
project that is already legacy code and

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:34,390
so rewrite is probably not the answer so

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:38,110
the second option we have the second

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:42,160
option we have is a to refactor some of

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:44,620
the nastier part of our code and the

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,290
problem with that is that refactoring

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,730
code that you didn't write so you don't

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,610
know a hundred percent what's going on

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,660
there and it's usually not completely

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:58,960
covered with this is very very risky and

00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:01,120
so that's not a great idea making small

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,130
maintenance steps on it is what I'm

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,130
going to talk about today but before I

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:09,490
do that I want to discuss why I think

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:14,320
that doing nothing is a very very bad

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:17,470
solution so as engineers we know the

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,140
phrase if it's not broken don't fix it

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,670
it's running in production we'll just

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,790
leave it there it's going to be fine

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:28,510
nothing will happen the problem is that

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:30,250
is that our projects are not isolated so

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,650
unless you have a little hello world

00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,889
running in bash you probably have a lot

00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,989
of

00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:37,480
tendencies you're firmly interacting

00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:39,189
with a lot of other systems and once

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,209
you're doing nothing your product

00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:45,040
project is actually decay so you could

00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:48,339
find that a project to interact with

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,079
change this a TI and you might wake up

00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:52,540
one morning and find it Google

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,309
deprecated API you were using and then

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,100
you won't have a choice but to go and

00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:59,919
update your project you might find that

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,439
a third party library and if you use and

00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,629
we all use today loads of libraries have

00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:06,100
an urgent security fix and suddenly you

00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:09,489
have to go and deploy with those

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,399
security fixes you might find a bug in

00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:13,839
your code which sounds a bit crazy for

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,059
projects that have been running for so

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,369
long that I can tell you that my HTML

00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:21,040
robot project had an urgent bug three

00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:23,529
months ago suddenly security team found

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,239
an urgent bag which was there for five

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:28,540
years but suddenly they found it and I

00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:30,579
had to go and fix it and you might find

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,739
that external technologies you use it

00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:35,499
have to be upgraded and you have to

00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:38,649
upgrade yours as well because you're

00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:42,069
sharing the resources of the company so

00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:43,689
we used a manga for example and the

00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:45,519
whole company was upgrading the manga

00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:47,949
version so I had to go and upgrade my

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,410
driver and it made a few code changes

00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:52,629
and I had to go and do it now if you

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:56,079
don't maintain your project regularly

00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:58,779
any one of those tasks can end up with

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,939
weeks or months of work just to get a

00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:05,980
project running again because so many

00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:09,610
changes have been made so I think that

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,760
main maintenance is the key and it is

00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:15,639
the balance between getting a lot of

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:20,350
technical debt or having your project

00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:23,079
decaying so where do we start I think

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:26,620
the first step before anything else is

00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:29,080
owning so having an owner for a project

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:33,309
it doesn't mean that only one person

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:35,710
knows this code or only one person has

00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:37,899
to touch this code it's not what it

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:41,169
means it means there is one person who's

00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:42,549
in charge of this project and he has to

00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:45,850
make sure that the project is up to date

00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:46,659
you can hand the job over to other

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,940
people

00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:52,119
and he can ask for other people to help

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,580
but one person is in charge so when a

00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:57,159
person is in charge he knows it's his

00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,470
responsibility if you say a team is in

00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,479
charge then maybe no one actually takes

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,090
responsibility for this project and

00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:06,299
another thing i would like to say is

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,919
that i know in a lot of companies they

00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,960
tend to give these projects to the more

00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,330
junior engineers because nobody really

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,029
wants to touch them so someone you comes

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:19,059
in and we say okay we'll give them this

00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:21,669
project and i think i think that's a bad

00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:24,519
event habit first of all because it's

00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:26,169
discouraging for junior engineers if I

00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:28,590
also think the more senior engineers

00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:30,399
have better understanding especially

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,830
engineers that have been in the company

00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:35,200
for a long time a better understanding

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:37,840
of why we got here what this project was

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,999
meant to do about the logic of the

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:45,039
project and so I think it's a better

00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:47,529
idea to give this project is a like

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,090
another task it's not your main task you

00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:50,979
always work on different project i'll

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,869
give it as another task for your more

00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:56,470
senior engineers which is what we do

00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:58,629
eight weeks and another important thing

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,599
to remember is that learning a new

00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:04,059
project takes time so if you inherited a

00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,190
really big project the chance of you

00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,080
actually going over it and understanding

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,960
everything that this project does is

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,629
very slim and i don't think it's a good

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,789
idea to invest all this time in it so a

00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:19,330
lot of people they like to really know

00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:24,369
the project to work on but for such big

00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:26,049
projects it's not always easy and i

00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:28,690
think a lot of time it's just a waste of

00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:30,970
your time so it's a better practice to

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,289
just learn one video fatah at a time

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,349
every time you have to touch something

00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:37,029
then you learn their piece so you should

00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:38,769
have a general idea about what this

00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:41,679
project is doing but you don't need to

00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:44,289
go and learn all of the api's on day one

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:49,720
you learn them you'll get to them don't

00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:52,809
worry eh and so we get to my four rules

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,989
of staying alive so the first one is

00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:57,970
always keep everything under CI so we

00:19:55,989 --> 00:20:00,370
work with continuous integration so

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,470
every time we push our code

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:06,580
the build runs automatically and all the

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:09,730
tests have to be green and then we can

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:13,000
go and deploy to production so always

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:15,550
make sure your build is green so a lot

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,440
of times my build breaks not because of

00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,210
change a change i made that because of

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,240
change if you change someone else made

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:24,250
so I depend on other projects internal

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,790
projects and they make it change and

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:30,040
then they break my project and so I go

00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:34,630
and look at why they broke my project

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:36,850
and I see that sometimes I see it's very

00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:39,040
simple they just moved one class

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,870
somewhere else so I delete my import and

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,940
I really important and everything is

00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:45,550
fine i ran my build is green five

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,730
minutes everything is ok i continue with

00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:50,950
whatever it is i did sometimes they make

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,380
a big change and they don't realize that

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:56,050
they actually broke your project so this

00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,730
is where the ownership sings come it

00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:01,090
comes in so i get an automatic email

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:03,820
that my project is is red now so it's

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,280
broken and then i go to the person who

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,990
broke the project and I say hey dude you

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,340
broke my project and it's his

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,320
responsibility it's not my

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,350
responsibility because it's my project

00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,600
to now go and fix it and spend a few

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,000
days to fix whatever this guy broke it's

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,350
his responsibility to fix the project

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,970
that he broke or roll back is cold or

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,400
discuss a solution with me if he needs

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,559
my help so I'm always there to help but

00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,660
it's everybody's responsibility for this

00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,370
project I'm just the owner so I have to

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,920
go there and make sure that they

00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,740
actually do they do it and actually fix

00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,960
my project and the second thing which is

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:44,020
very important is to deploy to

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,420
production regularly and so eight weeks

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,520
we have this automatic email for our

00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,920
projects not just legacy project if you

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,200
haven't deployed them for 30 days you'll

00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,640
get an automatic email saying you

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,170
haven't applied for 30 days please

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,050
deploy and then we just go and deploy

00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:01,179
and what happens every once in a while

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,590
is that I go and I deploy this project I

00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:04,830
haven't touched it for the last month's

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,000
I just go and deploy it and it fails

00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:10,720
maybe because someone changed the

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,330
dependency a some version changed and

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,110
it's not working anymore but at least I

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,020
know that I

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:20,470
only have one month back to look at to

00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:22,600
find what broke my project where is if I

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,150
wouldn't deploy it every month I might

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,690
find myself looking at a year back of

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:30,790
logs of get low get commits and trying

00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:36,970
to figure out who broke my project and

00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:39,760
that's just crazy my second tip is keep

00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:42,010
up to date with dependencies so our

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,830
project use use a lot of dependencies

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:47,530
and we try to upgrade them all the time

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,150
and I did put a disclosure as long as

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,330
they don't break compatibility and

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:55,000
that's I think up to you to decide if if

00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,970
they break compatibility if you want to

00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
upgrade anyway and fix or you want to

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:03,100
leave it as it is so I think most minor

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,049
versions don't very compatibility but

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:10,150
major versions might and then I I always

00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:13,299
look at it how hard the fix is going to

00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:16,179
be so if it's like 2-3 hours i just go

00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:17,910
into it and if i look at it and I say

00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:20,559
okay this is going to take me a few days

00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:23,230
then usually a leave it alone unless

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,760
it's an important security update and

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,870
then I don't have a choice I'd go and do

00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,570
it and the second one is don't be

00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:32,890
tempted to freeze dependencies so a lot

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,200
of times we attempted to do that

00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:38,650
especially on those very very old

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,780
project if I think it's an all it's a

00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,540
bad idea because of all the reasons I

00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:46,059
spoke to you before of why doing nothing

00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,919
usable area and I think we're always

00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:49,480
right to actually update our

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,250
dependencies and keep up to date with

00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,760
all the other projects in the company

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:58,330
and the other thing I would also say is

00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:01,000
that we did try on those projects to

00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:03,250
kind of not upgrade them when we did add

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,010
their upgrades in the company so we

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,780
started running all our web servers and

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,760
tomcat then we move to Jackie and we

00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,799
left them in tomcat because we said we

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,600
don't want to invest those days to move

00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:17,200
them to jetty don't know what's going to

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,200
happen and it is the day we spent so

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,730
much time having to maintain this old

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,470
technology that those projects were

00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,660
still working with it it was more

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,090
worthwhile just going and doing the move

00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,190
so moving with everybody else so

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,320
I just try and make sure the project

00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:34,539
moves whenever everybody all the other

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,690
projects move to something I try and

00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:40,510
move those projects as well and the

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:43,090
world the world of Sam I have with my

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,799
boss is if it takes me more than five

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,419
days then we're giving up and we're not

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,120
doing this so I'm not going to spend

00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:51,250
more than five days on an old project

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,270
but if it's less and usually today or

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:57,460
two then we're going to go and do it so

00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,799
the starting for the search thing i

00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,570
learned i want to say a few words about

00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:03,640
our form work so i know a lot of

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:06,130
companies probably have it as well we

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,140
have a framework and where we have a lot

00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:11,080
of services that are shared between all

00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,960
projects a like network concerns and

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:17,440
security and other concerns and what we

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:20,380
found out was that over time we made a

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,600
lot of changes to the frameworks but all

00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:26,350
those old legacy projects continued

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,419
continued using the old code and it had

00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,850
to stay there in the firm work just for

00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:33,250
those old legacy projects and then one

00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,770
day we woke up and we found new projects

00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,270
that were using this old code that we

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:39,549
didn't want anybody to touch and we

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,320
actually marked as deprecated but people

00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:44,440
were using anyway because they found it

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,750
in the framer and so we actually

00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,950
isolated it we took all of that old code

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:55,029
out put it in a new project called it

00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:57,929
legacy projects to not use so we

00:25:55,029 --> 00:26:00,789
actually quarantine their old code and

00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:02,770
we actually learn the lessons so the

00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:06,700
lesson we learned is a done pollute

00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:08,799
other projects so and we were polluting

00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,539
the framer project with all this old

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,730
code because they couldn't delete it

00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:15,159
because of us and the day they deleted

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:18,279
all this code there was a little party

00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:21,820
in the office and the second thing is

00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:24,370
that cut that code that exists will be

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,549
used even if you mark it with deprecated

00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:29,770
even if you put big comments of why

00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:31,330
people shouldn't use it they will use it

00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:36,940
if they find it so if you don't want

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:41,710
people to use it hide it and then the

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:45,130
force t is that small steps are the key

00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:49,899
so and whenever you touch the code you

00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:51,429
go you see duplications of a old classes

00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:55,929
the change and you're still using the

00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:58,240
old version imports etc just remove them

00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:00,880
I actually have in my calendar 15

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,159
minutes per week where I go to my

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,720
project and allocative and I just I run

00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:06,460
the bill then I get the list of all the

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,980
warnings and I started going over them

00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,350
and they say and then I say oh my time

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,020
is up okay next week I could push

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:17,409
whatever I did and next week and so it

00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:21,909
keeps the project a kind of cleaner than

00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:23,320
if you just leave it alone and I improve

00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:25,140
the test so every time I attach

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,559
something I have to fix the bag

00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:32,710
something broke I try and add a test to

00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:34,960
check whatever it is that broke and so I

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,990
think over time I have more and more

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,419
tests in my code base it will never be

00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,190
fully covered it will never be properly

00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:44,620
tested by at least like you have more

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:46,809
tests and the next time I might actually

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:50,620
find the bag because of the tests I hear

00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:53,350
and I make small refactor so if I got a

00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:56,440
piece of coal and I'm ready and I didn't

00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:58,120
understand what a nurse is going on then

00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,770
I don't I'm not going to leave it like

00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,960
that after I understood what's going on

00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,880
I'm going to refactor 8 i'm going to

00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,190
maybe just extract to a method and give

00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,440
it a name so the next person will

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:12,100
actually understand what this meant to

00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,020
do maybe give it more readable names a

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,090
lot of times just making small changes

00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,490
like that can really help the next

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,659
person who looks at it or me in six

00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:25,360
months because I'm not going to remember

00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:27,130
what I did now and removing dead cone so

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,110
a lot of those projects actually have a

00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:32,140
lot of parts of them that no one uses

00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:34,270
any more and when you look at them hey

00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,460
you get scared because there are so many

00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:38,020
IP is but half of them aren't used and

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,830
you don't know what's used in what's not

00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:44,679
used and so I did use some monitoring

00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:46,840
tools so we use a new relic but you can

00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,059
use anybody trying to to check what

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,639
api's are actually used and whatever

00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:54,730
wasn't used I just removed and then I

00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:55,250
deployed slowly in a venture I didn't

00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,990
exit

00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,000
to delete I once actually accidentally

00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,880
delete some something someone needed it

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,950
took them one months until they complain

00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,520
so they didn't did it very urgently and

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:11,480
I added it back I think it's a good

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:14,330
practice so always remember the Boy

00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:18,050
Scout rule always keep the campground

00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:23,210
cleaner than you found it and I think

00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:26,450
kills a big questions sorry I forgot

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,250
about this time eh how long are those

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:30,050
project going to stay so I did say there

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:33,920
were immortal but that's not completely

00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:35,330
true so the primary source projects are

00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,050
did a lot of times they're the most

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:41,810
profitable project the company actually

00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:44,720
has why because they make a lot of money

00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:48,710
and you almost don't invest any time in

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:54,350
them so I invest 15 to 30 minutes maybe

00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:56,540
per week usually less than that and but

00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,700
the project makes a lot of money so it's

00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,230
very profitable so when will it die is

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,540
it the technology will come to end the

00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,160
fly so and are in our case when flash

00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,800
comes to end-of-life the flash project

00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,950
will end because can't run flash sites

00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:14,390
and anything when you finish my grading

00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:17,000
so we've discussed that before or when

00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,680
it's just not profitable anymore so over

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,510
time you might see that the number of

00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,360
customers just goes down and at a

00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:26,990
certain point the cost of my 30 minutes

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:31,130
might actually be lower then what this

00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:32,750
project is actually making and and so it

00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,730
won't be profitable anymore and the

00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:37,040
company will just decide to close it and

00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:40,790
you know the customers will have to find

00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:43,070
a different solution and so I think

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:45,710
you'll see that if you take small

00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:48,260
maintenance steps over time you'll keep

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,150
your project healthy and running and it

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,410
will be much easier and much more

00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:58,030
successful in maintaining those projects

00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:58,030
so that's it

00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:10,590
so any questions I can answer yes Matty

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:25,840
so i think i think a sometimes sometimes

00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,610
our project just become legacy so there

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,830
are already ours and we own them and the

00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:32,650
second thing which i'm not sure if you

00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:35,500
are here or not but we actually asked

00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:37,690
our senior developers to own the legacy

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,090
projects instead of swearing them for

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:43,390
the junior developers is done in most

00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:45,309
companies and I seek senior developers

00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,620
you expect them to understand the

00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:49,630
importance of those projects and people

00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,010
take them seriously and actually it's

00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:53,050
part of your job and you take it

00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:57,220
seriously it's not your the project you

00:31:53,050 --> 00:32:03,000
work on you do it as an extra but yeah

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:03,000
that's that's what we do yes

00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:12,930
yeah so we usually we find it yes I'm

00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,000
sorry so yes what do we do in our senior

00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:16,770
developer actually moves on to a

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,010
different company and now we have to

00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:24,090
find a new owner for this project and so

00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:26,040
it only happen to us once but but what

00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,230
we usually do is we found we find

00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,700
someone else who doesn't have a senior

00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,730
developer who doesn't have a legacy

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,110
project yet so we can give it because we

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:38,880
don't think it's fair to have more than

00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:41,040
one of those per person and and so we

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,680
just hand over the project as an end as

00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,960
I said before the new person doesn't

00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,660
have to spend his time now actually

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,400
learning this new project it is he needs

00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,490
to deploy it once a month that's easy

00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,470
goes and he does it and when you have a

00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:58,220
problem then he'll go and learn the code

00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:00,720
whatever broke he'll go and learn it and

00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,190
I think the other thing is that we have

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,770
a few people in the company who actually

00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,750
knows those projects so people that were

00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:09,510
still here when they were written and

00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:11,670
they really give a hand and help so it's

00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,020
it's a shared responsibility one person

00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:16,050
is an owner but it's really a shirt

00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:22,140
responsibility between all the senior

00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:23,170
developers that's it but thank you very

00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,939
much

00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,939
