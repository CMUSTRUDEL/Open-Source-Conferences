00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:15,190
so I work at Oracle data cloud it is the

00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:17,409
largest data platform in the world we

00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,130
sell data actually in in order to sell

00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:22,960
data we need to process a lot of data

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,849
petabytes scale every week and just in

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,710
case you were wondering this is what

00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:31,599
petabytes scale of calculation looks

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:34,330
like when running on amazon and you know

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,030
cloud isn't cheap and we had to optimize

00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:40,570
many things always it's a constant

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:43,240
process and we need to we had to

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:46,120
understand how cloud providers works how

00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,120
they operate so this is what I'm going

00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,890
to talk about so in case just you wanted

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,160
to compete with Amazon its start your

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,680
own cloud service provider the first the

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,290
first thing you need to offer is just

00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:03,520
the basic it's computing and storage and

00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:06,039
as many of you probably know storage is

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,390
just an application built on top of

00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:12,249
computing the second thing to offer is

00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,219
everything else I mean don't let your

00:01:12,249 --> 00:01:18,880
users pay for other external city and

00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:21,310
DNS other services just you want all

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,979
their money to go to you so you offer it

00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,979
to them and it's easy why because it

00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:31,539
these are just applications running on

00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:34,270
top of your computing service if your

00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:36,069
users like my sequels do they like Redis

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,950
you can offer it to them you can install

00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:43,659
it for them and wrap it nicely with some

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:45,880
UI or or you know API with Python and

00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:47,889
offer it as a brand new service which

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,009
you can charge for and then again these

00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:54,100
are adjust your computing services with

00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:56,439
some applications running on so now

00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,929
you've got a lot of computing resources

00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,259
which are sometimes hard to cells so you

00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:04,840
need to find ways to sell your attendant

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,599
resources so how you do that you sell it

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,580
as lambdas you can sell it as spot

00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,080
instances you can steadily the best way

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,680
is docker containers

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:18,160
you can just get rid of all your extras

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,800
that way and now you need to find a way

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,050
to charge your users so you need to make

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,600
it complicated use something catchy like

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,120
glacier data retrievals are priced based

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:35,440
on the peak of early retrieval capacity

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:37,810
used within a calendar month but

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,380
actually the general approach is much

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,120
easier the more your users pay the more

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,800
they use the more they pay of course but

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,460
the marginal cost is actually getting

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,930
smaller and there is this red line over

00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,930
there which represents the point at

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,240
which your users it is more cost

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,430
efficient for your users to run their

00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,740
own data center and you don't want to go

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,020
to that point so once they reach this

00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,020
yellow point over there you assign them

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,570
an account manager now this person's

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,910
only purpose is to make sure your users

00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:14,020
will keep on paying you and rely more

00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:18,300
heavily on your services one way to do

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,530
so is just simply by offering a discount

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,970
so you're getting further and further

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,580
from the point at which you consider

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:28,900
moving to your own data center at at

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,940
some point this is just a bad habit you

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:36,370
don't really want to get to that point

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:38,470
and well that's it so what you should do

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,959
should you just leave the cloud and run

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,810
and start your own data center that's

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,769
one option but you can also find a way

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:50,769
to hack the pricing model how you do so

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,769
well the easiest ways just remember that

00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:57,459
everything the cloud provider offers you

00:03:53,769 --> 00:04:01,870
is just applications running on top of

00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:04,630
your of the computing service and you

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:10,260
can do it yourself for example we built

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:13,420
our very own lb we built our own SQS we

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:18,580
don't use EMR the way amazon wants us to

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:20,140
use anymore and we rely heavily on spot

00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,450
instances which is basically the

00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,920
cheapest computing you can buy

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,570
and we recommend you to do the same

00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:31,190
thank you

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,190
