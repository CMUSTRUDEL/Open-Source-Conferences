00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:15,519
hello everyone my name is nati cohen and

00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:21,699
i'm a proud organizer of developed a

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:24,730
style vivre for the past year I've been

00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:27,640
working as a production engineer for

00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,640
similar web and for those of you don't

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,820
know similar web it's a market

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,550
intelligence company meaning that we can

00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,370
show you data about every mobile app out

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,949
there like the number of users the

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:46,120
number of installs we can show you data

00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:50,109
about every website the number of visits

00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:54,640
where the visits are coming from and we

00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:57,309
can do that globally similar web is a

00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,699
pretty cool company and unlike myself

00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:03,129
the production engineering team has some

00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:06,670
really great people and we'd love for

00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:08,830
you to join us however the story i'm

00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:14,460
going to share with you today I starts a

00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:17,380
year before I joined similar one and so

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,280
to begin with my story i'll need to tell

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:30,670
you a little bit about myself circa 2014

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:34,260
um so this is kind of me I was actively

00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:38,410
refraining from asking questions

00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:40,930
specifically technical questions because

00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,210
I thought there are stupid questions and

00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:48,490
I didn't want people to think that I'm

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:50,770
stupid to give you an example many times

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:54,700
I'd find myself reverse engineering a

00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:57,310
system written in a language I not

00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,410
really familiar with in framer excited

00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,320
don't necessarily know and I would do

00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:04,210
that for days just to avoid asking

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,729
someone who is sitting in the same room

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:13,290
as I am or open a chat window so nothing

00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,830
of that sort we'll have to talk about

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,610
breaking silo

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:23,020
said DevOps days right however back then

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:26,140
I love my silo I felt safe inside my

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,570
silo I knew everything there was to know

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:32,380
like at least better than the other

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:34,990
people in the other silos and like

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,770
working with other silos was terrifying

00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:41,110
for me because I didn't need I didn't

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,360
really know what they were doing and I

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,510
couldn't ask them stupid questions right

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,880
because they think I'm stupid and so we

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:56,230
all know what happens when you stay in

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:59,500
your own silo finally I was keeping my

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:02,230
distance from stages and I had some

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,750
really good reasons I didn't think I

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:08,380
have anything new to say I'm not an

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,440
expert on anything actually and as you

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:16,209
probably already seen I have terrible

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:21,880
english ah so this was my comfort zone

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:25,300
and 2014 but then I came across

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:29,730
something that really changed everything

00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:35,590
and this thing was motivation

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:38,650
motivational posters you probably seen

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:42,580
them in very successful startups you

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,920
seen them in large organizations and if

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,950
they have them on the walls they must

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,709
work and so all you have to do so I've

00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,140
been told is imagine yourself standing

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:57,160
on the peak of that mountain and BASE

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,290
jumping down and then BAM you're not

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,100
afraid anymore and you can do all the

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:08,950
things that you are afraid to do well

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:13,360
the end thank you of course not really

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:19,090
right motivational posters don't work as

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:22,540
well as getting from some random guy at

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:27,490
your company a sentence like you can do

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,470
it right both of this will not get you

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,460
through

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,490
terrifying inconvenient or hard task to

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,190
do that you will need proper motivation

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:43,220
not motivational posters so let's talk a

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:47,600
little bit about motivation and so

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:52,910
different people are get motivation

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:56,730
differently in my experience in our

00:04:52,910 --> 00:05:00,050
field of work long-term motivation is

00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:03,810
usually coming from setting some goals

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,940
for some people those goals would be I

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,550
want to work for facebook or want to

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:16,280
work for Google for some people it will

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:19,800
be I want to stay hireable at 40 my

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,310
motivation came from setting a career

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:26,240
goal that I want to be someday I still

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:30,570
want to be in a key technical position I

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,270
looked at my role models people like

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:37,800
Frank control and Adrian cockroft and

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,960
what I noticed was all those people have

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,430
really good communication skills and

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:48,210
that makes sense they are influencing

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:50,640
people for a living so therefore I

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:54,930
needed to develop good communication

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,930
skills so now that you got your goal and

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:01,350
you got your motivation the next step

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,300
would be is to make a list you want to

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,970
make a list of all the actions that you

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:10,140
can take that can take you one step

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:12,479
further to your goal right and you want

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,270
to categorize that list there are three

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,450
types of actions the first one the first

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,370
type is easy actions these are actions

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,610
that you are feeling comfortable with

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,940
taking on the second type of actions are

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,250
the terrifying actions and the third one

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,700
is actions that you don't want to take

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,620
it easy to confuse the last two because

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,250
of course you don't want to take actions

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,470
which terrifies you right but try to

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,270
think about terrifying actions as

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,510
actions that you are willing to

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:49,040
take if they weren't terrifying you can

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:52,830
see why it will work and so for me

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,870
example for an easy action would be to

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,810
read a book or to read a blog post or to

00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,210
see a video on youtube a terrifying

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:05,490
action would be to do some public

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:08,180
speaking and a action that I want to do

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,790
is join for example an improv class

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:17,580
which is great for other people and not

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:23,430
for me so what if you can get to your

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:26,880
goal by only doing easy tasks then the

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:30,090
answer is easy do it right get up your

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,310
ass and just do it already you can do it

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,910
right now you don't really need this

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:39,750
talk right but what if you need to pick

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:41,820
things of the turbine list in that case

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,400
I would like to share with you the metal

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:48,030
odor the methodology I've been using for

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,610
the past two years so it's easy it's

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,610
only five steps you need to find support

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:56,580
take the first step follow through get

00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:02,730
feedback and repeat let's go a little

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:04,400
bit into that find support what let's

00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:07,130
start with what this support will do

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,100
this support will help you find

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:14,400
opportunities to do terrifying things it

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:17,340
will help he or she will help you for

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,350
example write your cfp submission and it

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,410
will and he or she will help you follow

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:25,140
through and get some honest feedback at

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,720
the end it can be anyone you trust it

00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:31,730
could be your friend your spouse your

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:38,310
team member your team leader or a mentor

00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:40,320
my example was my mentor and a friend we

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,470
went together to dev ops days loop Liana

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,190
a couple of years ago and they had an

00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,570
opening for an ignite and he told me

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:52,260
here's an opportunity you should go

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:56,310
ahead and speak do a five minutes ignite

00:08:52,260 --> 00:09:01,020
and then I told him you know this

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:04,920
is terrifying me I don't want these

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:07,890
people to think I'm stupid and he said

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,260
well we're in Ljubljana this is Slovenia

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,910
do you really think you're going to see

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,540
any of those people again or they're

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:19,050
going to affect your career path and I

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,760
did see them again actually but at the

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,330
time it was reasonable and I'm a

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,100
reasonable guy and I told him okay but

00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm not an expert and don't have

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,860
anything to talk about and he said okay

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,410
so tell a story duh tell them about

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,600
something you did and for example tell

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:41,010
them about like you're the first Hadoop

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:46,550
cluster you've managed and so I did and

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,550
it went okay ish it's on video I'm sorry

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:57,150
the next step is to actively take just

00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:01,380
the first step toward that terrifying

00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:04,020
action and this example might be just

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,170
setting a date or writing an outline for

00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:10,680
your presentation something that will

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,620
take you not a lot of time and this

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,839
correlates nicely with a blog post my

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,450
wife sent me recently about the

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,490
two-minute rule for those of you don't

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,690
know the two-minute rule states that if

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:27,089
you want to take some harder in

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:30,540
inconvenient action then all you have to

00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:32,839
do is try to consistently consistently

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,980
do the first two minutes of that action

00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,940
for example if you want to start running

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,190
then when you get home from work put on

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,980
your running shoes and exit the door

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:50,870
that's it two minutes and if you do that

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,870
enough time you will start running and

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,930
if you don't do the first step actively

00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,330
then forever this terrifying action will

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,670
find itself we will find its way to the

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:07,250
bottom of your to-do list and you all

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:09,930
probably know that already finally ah

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,820
you'll have to follow through

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,830
you took the first step and there will

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,800
probably be some more steps along the

00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:19,560
way but each step is kind of small like

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,779
submitting a CFP is a small step after

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,760
submitting every seat after every CFP

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:26,520
submission I've done I thought to myself

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:35,250
oh my god what have I done what if

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:37,320
they'll choose me but you probably will

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,600
find yourself at the opportunity so

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,930
you're already there it not it won't be

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,810
perfect do it after doing a terrible

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:49,560
thing you have to do to more actions the

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:51,540
first one is get feedback two things you

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,899
need to know about good feedback a good

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,760
feedback is a diverse meaning you should

00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,680
go and ask feedback from people who are

00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,600
similar to you and you should go ask

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,209
feedback from people who are completely

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:07,110
different from you the second thing is

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:09,649
that a good feedback is sincere if all

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:14,390
the feedback you get is it was great

00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:14,390
then you probably need more opinions

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:23,100
there is another trick that you need to

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:24,779
get is how to take feedback and you need

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,520
to respect the person giving you

00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:29,070
feedback and knowing that we are in

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,320
Israel don't ever ever argue with the

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:36,209
person giving you feedback even if you

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:40,080
don't like it I take notes and assess

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:42,180
that feedback slowly if you don't like

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,300
the feedback you here then go and sleep

00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:49,459
on it for a day or two it might sink in

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,459
you might reject it but you gave it time

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:56,520
finally you will need to repeat that

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:59,130
scary action again the good news is you

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:03,870
got feedback and it got a little bit

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:06,480
easier to be honest two years into the

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:09,570
process and I'm still terrified before

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,579
each and every single talk but we're 18

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,579
slides in so I'm not going to start my I

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:19,500
wish I could tell you that if you follow

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,410
this methodology everything is going to

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,430
be awesome um but there are some

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,020
pitfalls

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:28,050
and I think you should know them and I

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:34,920
try to give you some solutions the first

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:37,230
pitfall would be people and so you need

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,560
to remember that not everybody is on

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:43,140
your team and that's okay some people we

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,110
try to tell you that the action you're

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:50,010
taking or your goal are not good and

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,360
some people we try to tell you that we

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,649
try to discourage you from actually

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,050
doing the thing you should listen to

00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:00,180
them with a grain of salt and try to

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:05,630
surround yourself with people rooting

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:09,980
for your success the second pitfall is

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:15,600
might be your employer your employer

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:17,880
might not be on board for example a he

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,320
or she might tell you that it's okay

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,970
that you would go and talk about the

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:26,850
things that you do at our company but we

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,860
are what we won't support you right in

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,230
this case you should ask yourself if you

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:35,700
can do this on your private time and

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:39,779
private resources the second type of

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,459
employer will actively resist either

00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,930
because they don't agree with the action

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:45,750
you're taking or they don't agree with

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,100
your goals for example there you might

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,920
tell you that you're not allowed to

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,589
publicly speak while working for this

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:58,860
company and not on the thing you work on

00:14:52,589 --> 00:15:02,820
and not on maybe in things related to

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:08,550
your work and so several solutions can

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:12,029
be done here um can be applied you can

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:14,010
take another action that circumvents

00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:17,040
your employer remember you have a list

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:19,680
now and if you don't have any other

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,220
action that you can take you can try and

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,310
join a secondary environment meaning you

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:30,600
can join an open source project or you

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:33,600
can go to a hackathon and if all this

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,500
doesn't work and while working for this

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:42,150
specific employer you are not allowed

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,860
to improve yourself and chase goals then

00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,980
maybe it's time to find another

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,020
workplace and I would like to play a

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,750
little game I learned this game at dev

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,360
ops days Amsterdam it goes like this

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,690
please raise your hand if you are hiring

00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:01,350
good dev or ops engineer that willing to

00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:03,210
work on their terrifying things okay now

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:11,390
look to your right look your left find a

00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:17,070
new employer the final pitfall is

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:20,250
surprising it's yourself you might find

00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,860
your brain working against you and there

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:26,150
are really great books and great blog

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:29,700
posts and great talks and YouTube

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:32,490
discussing how to overcome our natural

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:35,820
resistance for change how to handle

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:38,240
stress and my personal favorite how to

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,890
live with an acute impostor syndrome

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,710
I've added some links at the end of the

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:50,370
presentation but there are strictly just

00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:53,370
the beginning so to recap find your

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:56,180
motivation set yourself goals follow the

00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:59,850
steps and know the pitfalls and

00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:02,880
eventually you will profit or at least

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,339
it worked for me I'm now a production

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,260

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:10,680
in the Evangelist I encouraging mentor

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:14,160
speakers inside similar web I'm a
