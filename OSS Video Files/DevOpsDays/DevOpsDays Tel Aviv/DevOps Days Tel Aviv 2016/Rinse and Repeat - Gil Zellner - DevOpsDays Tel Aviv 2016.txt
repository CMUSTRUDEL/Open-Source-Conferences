00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:15,270
on this side it's kind of it clipped but

00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:18,070
we'll just make do okay hi I'm Gil and

00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,620
that's my Twitter handle so respond to

00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:26,200
everything I say with sarcastic remarks

00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:28,240
on Twitter thank you so software

00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,010
conferences your that meeting we all go

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,860
to where we try to poach each other

00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:40,500
while exchanging t-shirts wait it

00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:40,500
doesn't work sorry my bad yeah right

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:50,050
great so some of these conferences have

00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:55,230
these uh what the hell okay just you

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,230
know skip that and leave it whatever no

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,710
but the people of okay anyway so some of

00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:08,130
these have like a theme that's very very

00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:10,179
obvious some of them even more so and

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,619
well some of them you kind of need to

00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:15,189
dig in a little bit but you eventually

00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:17,200
you get it but some concepts transcend

00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:21,850
the one conference and you just see them

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,850
goddamn everywhere you get this kind of

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:29,829
Messiah driven engineering if you see a

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:32,159
many places and some of them just you're

00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:38,049
just so tired about hearing about them

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:40,029
and I know I'm tired of them so you just

00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:46,450
kind of not want to go to conferences

00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:49,090
anymore so this is me I currently work

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,079
for crosswise at Oracle data cloud and I

00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,689
worked in the past for a whole bunch

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,469
other companies again Twitter handle

00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:58,149
stop and I tried to think why did I feel

00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:00,459
this way why did I not want to go to

00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:02,049
conferences anymore because you know

00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:06,429
it's supposed to be fun and awesome and

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,899
cool so first of all I went to

00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:09,970
conferences and heard people talking

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:11,830
about continuous delivery when they

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,180
weren't doing continuous delivery people

00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,080
who said yeah dr. is cool but we've

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,960
never done doctor

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:22,090
and that went on for like two years also

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,490
I felt that this kind of stuff was being

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,400
recycled in a very very very disturbing

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:34,900
way those of you know the movie left

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:37,180
everybody else didn't and then I started

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,250
thinking but wait a second are these

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,480
talks really the same talks are we

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,070
really talking about the same things

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,930
over and over again because you know

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:47,920
even the same talk given by the same

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:52,750
person several times not the same joke

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:56,500
didn't work ok ya talkin about practice

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,840
yeah so for example take that one

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,430
marring talk they give three times it's

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,800
not the same talk to be give it here a

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,200
year ago and several times after you go

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,700
up and it's definitely not the same talk

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,530
different things and the thing with

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,880
content over time then you start out

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,770
with something very small you start with

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,780
like five minutes seen Richard 5 25

00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,720
minutes and when you distill it down you

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,830
get this kind of beer to whiskey effect

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,660
and you know you we all love beer but

00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,160
you know whiskey is much more wholesome

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,209
much more flavorful you're getting more

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:34,540
content for your liquids and the thing

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,519
is we don't have a problem with repeated

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:44,190
content when it's done well we have a

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:46,269
problem when she's done badly and so

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,920
we're no longer getting all these

00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:51,160
revolutionary things and conferences

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,230
which you know it's okay we don't have

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,920
time to have so many revolutions we're

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:59,340
getting evilution Airy content we're

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,570
gaining mastery we're telling people

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,550
this is how it should work with document

00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:07,030
production this is how you should do

00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:09,370
devops this is actually use AWS and

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:17,229
while some things we just can't get them

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:20,130
to work but you know but we're going

00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:22,990
deeper we're drilling down on things

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,090
which creates a whole different problem

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,530
where you have all these talks which

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,760
might be interesting but you have no

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,100
time to see

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,770
topics to study but that's a first world

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,810
problem you know I'm glad to be part of

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,240
a community that gives me such rich

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,320
content which is why I the way why I

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:45,850
decided to join the team at dev upstate

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,130
so lather rinse repeat and you know have

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,310
a good one

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,310
