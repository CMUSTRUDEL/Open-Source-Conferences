00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:13,330
make your developers on tour

00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:17,800
non-production and we've already talked

00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:22,470
about this stuff what we go to facebook

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,470
before that's an engineering and as a

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,760
facebook i migrated into production

00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:33,720
what the death

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,730
our lease attackers period so let's talk

00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:41,860
a little bit about tennis would be for

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:46,930
perpetual into basically we had 12

00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:49,930
cyber liability Operations Center a

00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:53,080
video / Asia and purpose of the thing

00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,890
was actually monitor or beside 24-7

00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,480
texting stuff fire fighting all the time

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,530
making sure that makes up and running by

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,830
himself and we did this by 24-7 agree

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:08,740
that even during nighttime somebody

00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,200
who's working actively on face so on us

00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:15,360
daytime somebody for America was working

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,360
on facebook on Europe daytime

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,000
and when we talk about the future of

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,299
Facebook getting started the company is

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,689
growing users are joining the service

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:34,140
all the time that it's just

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,420
steady what's wrong and the reason for

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,479
that is the payoff I'm standing together

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:45,959
next world that everybody understands

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:48,929
out with some something is that ok we

00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,569
had feed and we had photos and videos

00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:53,729
and groups and ads but later on we also

00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:56,729
had messenger as an independent service

00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:00,780
we had internet o dog which connects the

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:04,200
world from the infrastructure level we

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:08,179
have whatsapp we have Instagram and you

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,370
probably want to see oculus as well and

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:14,459
when the company grew to multiple

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,610
products and multiple kind of users and

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:20,299
use cases we started realizing that them

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,660
one of the biggest problems we had is

00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:26,549
context so remember that as a row was an

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,650
independent team they were not part of

00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:30,389
the social development process or

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,450
something like that they were just

00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:35,459
making sure everything works but they

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,150
don't really know exactly what the

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:41,970
product means they don't exactly know

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:44,940
the fine-tuning and the delicate parts

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:48,450
of the product itself this led sometimes

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,799
two people not really know exactly what

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,620
we are pushing to production right i

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:54,540
mean sure we have any release sure it

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,760
has some awesome features but how does

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,220
that affect the system what are those

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,340
features how many users are going to be

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,049
added now to facebook because of that

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,720
the other problem was that because we

00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:09,030
were out of context we sometimes focused

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,549
on the irrelevant stuff so I'm sure all

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,980
of you had this problem that you have

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:16,380
this component in production that you

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,819
just hate it you just just look at the

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,980
monitoring is a hate this

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:23,069
product and you want to fix it but

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:26,250
sometimes even if it's really annoys you

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,660
it's not the main focus of your team

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,960
maybe this

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,220
system is not really have any

00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,880
consequences of production alone or on

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,830
your users and eventually that leads to

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:42,450
conflict with the developers so you have

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:44,460
this dev versus ops situation the other

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:49,980
problem is that because we are fighting

00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:55,950
fighting all the time we n as engineers

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:58,140
we always try to try to perform better

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,200
try to grow try to learn new

00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,360
technologies new development languages

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,940
any other kind of stuff like that and

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,510
when you have this desire to perform in

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,490
one hand this notion this believe this

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,830
thing that keep you going and on the

00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,900
other hand you are fire fighting all the

00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:19,020
time trying to make sure it works you

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,060
get frustrated and you say I just I just

00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:24,090
want to learn anything and then

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:29,550
sometimes we get a little bit unfriendly

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:31,620
i would say delicately and eventually it

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,750
leads to people burning out right you're

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,770
just coming to work you wanna you want

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,380
to keep on going you wanna keep on

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,860
learning but you have this all mess that

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,350
you trying to fix and it's really hard

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,419
so as a company we thought about what we

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,880
can do how we can fix this how we can

00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,380
fix this problem and we looked at the

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,830
industry we saw what the industry has to

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,169
offer and one thing we saw is not a

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,320
network operations center but the

00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:00,600
problem with the knock for us is that

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,110
it's a network operation center it's a

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,060
centralized solution it's something like

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,970
taking as a row and institutionalizing

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,500
it inside a company which only depends

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,930
the gap between development and

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,950
operations so it wasn't a good fit for

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,770
us so we thought well it let's

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:22,710
invent something that we want to do so

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,540
inverter production engineering and yeah

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,040
this but I by the way this was made by

00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,520
shahe which I don't know where he is

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:33,090
yeah there you go so we thought about

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,490
lets it reinvent something new and a lot

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,560
of time during interviews or over here

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,570
when I mingle with people people ask me

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,249
what what is this production engineering

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,439
what is different between

00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:46,489
engineer and the devops engineer or a

00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:50,159
system engineer or whatever engineer and

00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:52,259
the thing is that there is no really

00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:54,569
difference between a software engineer

00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,969
and a production engineer so think about

00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:58,289
like this you have a software engineer

00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:00,419
right everybody here knows what a

00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:03,059
software engineer is and a software

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:05,339
engineer could be an Android engineer it

00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:07,709
could be an iOS engineer it could be a

00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:13,949
linux kernel engineer it could me it

00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:15,419
could be windows engineer just Mia so a

00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,319
production engineers just like any other

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:21,659
software engineer but its main expertise

00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:25,709
and focus is making sure that production

00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:26,999
is available that is running that the

00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:30,559
code that we write actually works on

00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:33,479
production and he is part of the team so

00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:36,599
software engineering team in facebook

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,339
are compiled from Android engineers iOS

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,139
engineers and production engineers and

00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:42,089
web engineers and whatever engineers you

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,499
you might have and because of that we

00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:47,039
are taking part in meetings we are

00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:48,629
involved in roadmap we have this insight

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,439
on the product that we didn't have

00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:55,379
before the sorrow and of course because

00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,309
we are sharing we are in the same thing

00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:58,139
with the software engineers we also

00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:59,699
share uncle rotations together because

00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,889
it only makes sense that if you are

00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,360
working on something with your teammates

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:07,439
you're going to own it together right

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:11,219
and as the company grows and you have

00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:14,429
more teams you have more products this

00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:16,469
model can scale out because if you can

00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:18,809
scale more team in your company you can

00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:21,029
put just maybe one maybe two maybe 10

00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:23,009
depending on your team another

00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:26,969
production engineer and this model can

00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:30,839
scale out so let's talk a little bit

00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:35,099
about a novel so whenever is it is now a

00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:39,659
team inside Facebook we make Android and

00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:42,089
iOS apps to offer VPN connectivity and

00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:45,269
data compression and data control on

00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:48,269
your mobile data plan another was

00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:50,939
founded in 2010 and since then until a

00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:53,579
2003 when we were required by Facebook

00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:54,350
we ran at the same model as you might

00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:56,540
have encountered

00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,330
in your day to day life developers are

00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,120
writing the code making sure that we

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,980
have new features that we can grow as

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,420
from the user perspective and operation

00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,300
make sure that everything is up and

00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:11,870
running deployment and in you know the

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,970
drill and when we got into Facebook and

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,250
we started looking around we saw that

00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,860
this production engineering thing is

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,500
actually works it actually works we can

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,060
we can see that we have teams with

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,550
software engineers and production

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,520
engineers that are working together and

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:31,640
owning together production developing

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,440
together the application the

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,830
infrastructure whatever they do and it's

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,479
very successful at it which really blew

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,880
our mind so we thought about what we can

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,090
do after we realize this is a good

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,210
solution for us as well so what I want

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,700
to do now is make kind of a couple of

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,640
steps guide how-to guide for you guys to

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:57,050
think about what you can do in your

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,420
organization maybe later on so the first

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,640
step is relatively simple go ahead and

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,020
sit with your developers there is a

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,120
crossed line I'm not sure it's being

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,740
seen over here but make sure you go

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,050
ahead and sit with the developers not

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,850
close to them not next to them with them

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,700
in the same room if possible if you're

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,420
in an open space just barge into the

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:20,060
open space just be there and the thing

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,010
about humans is that we have this nice

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,970
feature when we can talk to each other

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:28,730
it's amazing I can assure you and once

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,080
you start talking and start to make

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,910
building this relationship with your

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,660
developers you achieve a couple of

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,940
things one is you notice what is going

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,440
on with their lives you know this what's

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,690
difficult for them in the day to day job

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,940
maybe it's the development tools maybe

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,350
it's the deployment process maybe it's

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,210
some kind of another tooling that they

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,420
have maybe I don't know something else

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:53,740
and the other thing is that you are

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:56,300
getting most noticeable so I had

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:59,810
experience in previous companies that I

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:02,150
walked for a couple of years and I had

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,950
really good friends but after like maybe

00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,839
one year one year and a half somebody

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,100
when a good friend of mine came to me

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,720
and said listen

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,700
what do you actually do I mean you're

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,010
here the company for so long I have no

00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,810
idea what you do so when you sit next to

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,310
them you also get noticeable they

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,140
understand what your function in the

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:22,520
organization and because of that they're

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:26,360
going to appreciate you more step number

00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,700
two is I think the most difficult one to

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,260
start and begin this conversation with

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,910
your colleagues and make sure they

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,540
understand what is production engineer

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:43,010
and why it's good for them yeah this is

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:44,960
very well yeah so you want to start

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,610
having conversation right you want to

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,320
make sure that everybody are on board

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,570
with you and you want to go forward this

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,820
process and when you think about it

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:56,300
eventually you will go ahead and say to

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,180
someone congratulations let's do uncle

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,210
together and the reaction might be a

00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:05,990
little I don't know something like this

00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,940
maybe a little wutface it's not really

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,220
easy to get this message going right

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,990
some of them might even panic some of

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,150
they might even say listen I don't have

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,770
the skill set I don't know what SSH is I

00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,200
don't know what linux is I just write

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:20,210
code that's all I do something some

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,610
people can say I don't have time for

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:26,210
this I need to build features I need to

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,350
make the legs release I my product my

00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:31,880
product managers that's sitting on my

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:36,350
neck and I just cannot do it something

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,210
else it's your problem by the way and

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,560
some people might even say you know what

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,170
 this I don't want to do this and

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,210
I'm going home and you don't want to get

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,920
into this situation of course you want

00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,690
to make sure that they really understand

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,240
what they're getting into and they want

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:54,320
to do this so I'll try to convey my

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,030
message using some piece of code but

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,640
it's not proper code so don't get too

00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:01,730
caught up with this if you find syntax

00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,800
error find me a bug I'll fix it so the

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:07,790
first thing is to talked with your

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,350
managers start beginning with maybe it's

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,300
going to be your city oh maybe it's

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,090
going to be or tech lead maybe it's one

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,260
of your managers in the organization

00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,510
somebody that has influenced and

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,120
somebody that you can actually go up and

00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,940
speak to

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,620
the reason for that is that eventually

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,360
would you would want to go ahead and

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,950
talk to the engineers right they are

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,260
going to be the one to do Hong Kong and

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,730
they might go ahead and escalate to the

00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,280
manager because they don't like the idea

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:37,910
or because they don't fully get why they

00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,710
need to do this and if you have the back

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,180
of you of your managers it will be much

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,310
more easier to convey the message

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,950
together as a team and and that is an

00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:49,790
individual that just went crazy and when

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:52,610
I put everybody on on call after you do

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,320
that go ahead and make sure you align

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,950
all the engineers like in the line and

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,430
think about who is the most approachable

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:04,160
who is more likely to understand why

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:07,580
this is important and the reason for

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,590
that is again as as you gain more people

00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,290
that actually agree with you and

00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:15,110
understand this is a the right solution

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,880
it will be much more easier and after

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,440
you do all of this and any you kind of

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,440
mapped out everything just go ahead and

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,300
talk for each person just go ahead and

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,850
talk with them try to convey your

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,010
message and while you do that make sure

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,050
that you're not forcing yourself because

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,360
when you start approaching people and

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:35,720
you wanna change the way they walk and

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,360
not what they work on it's really

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,140
difficult sometimes for people to just

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,300
understand the idea that you are not

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,040
trying to make their life shittier you

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,040
just want to make their life better and

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,860
the company better so make sure you open

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,170
for feedback because in this stage some

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,990
people might say listen I don't know a B

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,880
and C so you need to take note ok we

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,620
need to teach them a B and C we need to

00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,330
fix all of these problems one by one

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,960
until everything is at the end everyone

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:05,330
is ready and again the more people you

00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:09,800
you get on board the easier it be it is

00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:12,230
going to be for you next so now you talk

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,230
with everybody and everybody wants to do

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,540
it right because it's a good idea and

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,580
now the thing is that everybody are

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,240
willing or maybe most of the people are

00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:25,730
willing and you want to make sure that

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,490
they have is less friction as possible

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:31,250
before they're going to go ahead and own

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,380
production so a lot of times we right

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,850
tools for ourselves

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,410
and we don't really think about the

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,870
other folks that are going to be running

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,540
it as well so the first step I would say

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,880
is just have some small documentation

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,040
not something grandiose it's going to be

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,930
taking like 15 years to complete but

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,230
just point us to the technologies that

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,820
used to the open source project to the

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,040
parts of the code that are interesting

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,840
some scripting and tooling that you have

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,820
make sure you have it laid out if

00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,120
somebody wants and go ahead and start

00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:05,110
learning by himself for him to have a

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,600
starting point the other thing is that

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,840
our tooling are not always suitable for

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,390
everybody right I mean if you go ahead

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,400
and give someone a nagios dashboard or

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,410
an Aggies config they don't really know

00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,200
exactly what to do with it maybe you

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,520
have some scripts that you wrote for

00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,410
yourself because we like to automate

00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,300
stuff all the time but they are not

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,910
really readable all suitable for someone

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:30,640
else to use so like arguments and and

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:33,940
help for passing the command line or

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,100
whatever for example i can say that in

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:39,160
facebook we have the system to create

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,660
alerts right so if you want to create an

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,260
alert you just go ahead and clone a

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,150
repository you have a small python file

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,540
and you need to run a bunch of functions

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:52,330
that are well documented somewhere as an

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,920
API and after you wrote this code then

00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,950
you ship this code due to the repository

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,230
you have an alert easy like you don't

00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,630
have to know a new dsl or a new

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,190
configuration syntax or whatever it's

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:07,390
very friendly and approachable to

00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:10,630
somebody else and the 13 the third thing

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:14,770
about tuning is graph and dashboards so

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:16,840
I can say for myself that I really

00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,000
really love their sports sometimes I

00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,800
even love them too much and because of

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,310
that they look like a pile of corals and

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,900
 and because of that when somebody

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,910
else want to go ahead and take a look at

00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,170
my n bi dashboards especially when they

00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,270
are uncle and they try to debug a

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,590
production issue it's really difficult

00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,640
for them to understand what's going on

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,930
so make sure that you have a set of

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,820
dashboards that are high level that they

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,130
give good intuition of the health of the

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,320
service and thing to notice here is that

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,840
go ahead and make sure that they you

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,890
have

00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,720
duction kpi's right make sure that that

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,420
you have proper titling that the key is

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,180
that the name of the metrics makes sense

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,100
to somebody that is not building that

00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,080
who hasn't built the actual dashboard

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,480
they actually know what's going on over

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,640
there and of course make them intuitive

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,560
and reachable may be there for the

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:13,640
product managers maybe even for the

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:15,830
managers themselves after we went on our

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,030
tooling alert is kind of like our

00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:21,680
tooling as well but think about it again

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,960
some software engineer goes that go

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,970
ahead his uncle now he's waking up in

00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:29,120
the middle of the night and he gets an

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,740
alert if it's a false alarm he will just

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,350
he will hate you for the rest of your

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,090
love of his life because it it's I mean

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,130
why did you wake me up if it's a false

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,680
alarm so make sure you go ahead and

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,780
review all of your lips from scratch

00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,020
it's gonna bei it's going to take a long

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:47,330
time but make sure you do it the thing

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,340
to note here is that make sure that you

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,820
actually indicating a real problem I

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:55,460
mean I can talk on this slide for one

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,830
hour and a half easy but make sure it's

00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,360
actually a real problem and not only

00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,490
that it's a real problem it's

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,990
interesting it's impactful and you

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:07,040
actually can do something about it

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,840
because if not the developers and

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,420
everybody who is going to be on call

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,550
just a fairly going to say well this is

00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,650
 I'm not going to do this so again

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:20,260
remove the friction and make everything

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:24,290
as smooth as possible once you get into

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:27,620
into this date you have your team or

00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:30,650
your company whatever granularity you go

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,390
ahead and perform this process willing

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,490
and you have the tooling ready for them

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,250
and everything is just set up for you to

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:40,940
get started and in order to train the

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:44,870
team you need to make sure that you take

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:49,100
something in into consideration learning

00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:52,340
something or teaching somebody is super

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,590
easy but remembering it one day

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,380
afterwards maybe a week later maybe a

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,169
month later it's extremely impossible to

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,179
do

00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:03,659
mean I learned a lot of stuff during my

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:06,029
career I remember none of it like i'm i

00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:07,739
i'm using man pages all the time right i

00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:09,659
don't really know what's going on I

00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:11,399
don't remember flags or remember systems

00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:13,889
I need to keep remembering it all the

00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:17,429
time and because of that when you

00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:20,100
structure your your training your

00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:22,830
training sessions make sure that you

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,570
have again some kind of a wiki a small

00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,039
one not something big but again

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,529
something that they can go ahead and go

00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,419
back to and say yeah remember he was

00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:32,070
thinking about this chef thing I don't

00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,289
remember what he does I'm going to go

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:39,239
ahead and look it up and just learn by

00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:41,580
myself the other thing is that the best

00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:44,850
way to remember something is to actually

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,440
do it right you can learn you can you

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,299
can read a bunch of stuff but until you

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,190
go ahead and do something that's when

00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:54,179
the learning process is taking place so

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:56,730
hands-on hands on hands-on we created a

00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,850
pool of tasks that we can just spread

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:02,330
out to engineers that the judge can go

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,489
on and do it without our help liver and

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:07,739
it doesn't have to be high-impact it

00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:09,710
doesn't have to be the next big feature

00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:13,919
in the infrastructure it just has to be

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:16,590
like a like a small dip in the world

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,450
just go ahead and do as a chef Dave go

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,570
ahead and provision ourselves go ahead

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:24,269
and set up a new whatever you guys have

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,249
in your infrastructure and of course

00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:28,710
when you do it make sure you do it

00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:30,299
reusable because the next engineer that

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,159
we're going to go to go into the team

00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:33,899
you're going to be probably the one

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,909
who's going to do this session again so

00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:41,009
make sure you reuse everything when you

00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:43,440
do it and after everybody is willing and

00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:44,970
everybody has their skill set you will

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,779
want to go ahead and start to do the

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:53,580
uncle rotation on production which is

00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:55,980
the fun part actually and a couple of

00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,980
thing here is that if you think about it

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,529
and I'm probably sure that if you try to

00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:06,749
recall your past experience when you

00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:08,609
join a company it's really scary even

00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:10,090
some time to go ahead and do this first

00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:12,070
encore rotation

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,450
very difficult because you lack the

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,039
confidence you're not really sure if

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,559
you're going to own it you're not sure

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,510
if something breaks you will actually be

00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:22,210
able to fix it or understand even what's

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,740
the problem and try to keep that in mind

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,900
when you do it when you do this first

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,380
couple of iterations so in order to

00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:31,779
overcome this we started by doing just

00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,909
very short amount of alcohols like the

00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:36,669
psycho stem cell very very short we did

00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:38,980
one day for each engineer right so let's

00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:41,890
say we have I don't know five engineers

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:45,640
we just did five days where one of them

00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:47,649
8h did one uncle and as they gain more

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,720
confidence we expand a little bit from

00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:52,809
one day to two days from two days to

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,809
three days for four days eventually to

00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:58,779
one week and the thing to notice here is

00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:02,799
that when you think about it I I'm a

00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:05,409
live example of somebody who heard a

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:08,020
software engineer says I'm willing to

00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,779
own production for one week all by

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:15,279
myself and that by himself it it's just

00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:17,409
 amazing the other thing we did

00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,450
in order to make sure that they gain

00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:22,179
this confidence over time is to do uncle

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:25,840
summaries so after we did uncle after

00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:28,450
each engineer did the uncle he made some

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,460
list of the alert that were raised and

00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:35,140
what he did in order to tackle them and

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,730
what we can do in the future because

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,620
maybe we can automate some of the stuff

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:42,580
maybe we can even remove some of the

00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,960
alerts and when you do this uncle when

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,770
you start to do this rotation with the

00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,419
other engineers they might go ahead and

00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,690
dismiss some of their lives right we all

00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:54,789
we all done it that I mean I did it you

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,529
you see an alert you said yes it's gonna

00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:59,110
fix itself in a couple of minutes and

00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:01,840
then it doesn't so when something

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,490
happens make sure you are preemptively

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,409
go ahead and making sure that they are

00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,870
actually doing something you don't have

00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:09,279
to be all creepy about it in just you

00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,380
know sitting behind their deaths just

00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,510
make sure you talk to them and say yeah

00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,950
I saw this alert came up are you all

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,899
right do you need any help or something

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,799
that just make sure you are possible and

00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:19,799
they know you are there for them

00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:29,570
yeah and so let's try to sum up all of

00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:31,399
the steps so step number one is go ahead

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,469
and sit with them make sure you build

00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,999
this relationship with them make sure

00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:37,339
you are noticeable make sure they

00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:40,309
understand what's your genders and what

00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:42,019
what you do in your day-to-day life then

00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,579
go ahead and speak with them make sure

00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:44,599
you get the feedback that you need from

00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:47,119
them because they're going to have

00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,849
feedback guaranteed they will have

00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,739
something to say about this after you do

00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:55,009
that make sure that your tooling is

00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:57,079
ready because it is probably not i mean

00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,669
when i write something new it's going to

00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:03,049
be crappy for somebody has to go ahead

00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:05,929
and look and try to use it and again

00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:07,399
also for your alerts make sure that your

00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:09,319
letters are indicative they are

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:11,119
impactful and they're actually signal on

00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:15,139
a real problem and that's something you

00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:17,899
just made up do the training and when

00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:19,999
you do the training try to remember it's

00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:21,949
kind of fun because you need to try to

00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:24,429
remember that learning is easy but

00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:27,049
remembering is hard so make sure that

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:29,419
it's going to be it's going to take a

00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:31,519
while and make sure you can do it with

00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:34,729
some tasks or some documentation that

00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,949
they can later follow up on and finally

00:24:34,729 --> 00:24:38,659
go ahead and start do the uncle and make

00:24:36,949 --> 00:24:40,369
the uncle with them in the first time to

00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:43,909
make sure that they feel comfortable and

00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:48,319
they have this confidence to actually

00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:52,249
own production and after all of these

00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:54,289
steps that we did we we were doing on

00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:56,749
call and the software engineers were

00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:59,239
doing alcohol and I felt really good

00:24:56,749 --> 00:25:01,969
about that but what what I feel even

00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:04,539
better that soft when desoto engine is

00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:07,669
now in my team actually making

00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:10,339
initiatives by themselves so a bunch of

00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:12,559
the layers that we have were not that

00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:14,809
impactful in terms of our production so

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,279
we just remove those because it takes a

00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:17,839
lot of time to fix it and we know we

00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,489
didn't know not going to have time for

00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:23,179
this so we just delete everything and

00:25:19,489 --> 00:25:25,519
these were dismal changes rent by the

00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:27,799
software engineers some of the software

00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,450
engineers really like Jeff apparently

00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,569
and they just made a bunch of divs and

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,500
they change a part of stuff on how chef

00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:37,640
behaves in the

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:40,490
in the infrastructure and another win

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,260
that we had is that we try to make the

00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:44,930
software engineers work on some

00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,760
peripheral that we have in our VPN

00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:48,500
infrastructure and it was really

00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,300
difficult to do that before this process

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,120
because we tried and it didn't work and

00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,610
after this process one of the engineers

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,260
took it by himself and go ahead and make

00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:03,430
this change and we gained a really

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:05,420
significant change improvement in CPU so

00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,670
there are benefits to this process

00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,190
eventually so I'd like to give you some

00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,620
tips from my point of view on this

00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:15,860
process and not only just a list of

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,870
things to do so one thing is make sure

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:21,890
you are openly communicate everything

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:26,870
right when I started this process I felt

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:29,390
that after I start engaging the software

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,490
engineers nobody is going to like me in

00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,880
this company forever because I'm going

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,080
to save them let's do uncle together and

00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,780
after I thought about it before I

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,430
approach them I thought but I really

00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,780
believe in this process I really believe

00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,750
that this is the right thing to do

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,250
because of everything I said because I

00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,560
really strongly believe in it and

00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,450
because I came with confidence and I was

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,460
able to listen to what they say and I

00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,950
wasn't defensive about it I was able to

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:59,120
actually make progress which was pretty

00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:02,290
impressive in my opinion the other thing

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,550
to do is make sure you have deadlines

00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:07,250
it's really easy to get carried away in

00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,560
this process so for example reviewing

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,870
your alerts right if somebody has done

00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,220
it in this process in this company you

00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:15,590
know it's going to take some time

00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:18,440
because you need to remove some and

00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:20,570
redefine some thresholds and it could

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,490
take a lot of time so make sure that you

00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,960
have deadlines so you back at your time

00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,360
because it's really easy to carry the

00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,740
way in technical stuff instead of just

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,940
go ahead and approach your colleagues

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:34,250
and when you do start this uncle and you

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,480
do you do start ash hand holding

00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,940
everybody together in the song called

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,710
it's going to take a lot of time it's

00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,630
going to take a lot of contacts which

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,920
because people will need your help all

00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,150
the time at the beginning because they

00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,830
don't really know they lack this

00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,899
confidence

00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,610
so make sure you are available and it's

00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:52,070
going to take a lot of time from your

00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,690
end so when you plan your quaddle when

00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,990
you plan your half go ahead and think

00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:59,179
about it and of course make sure you

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,100
open for feedback in this process all

00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:05,870
the time because otherwise you would

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:08,029
just won't be able to finish it and I

00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:13,159
think that the main message I want to

00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:16,490
like put in your heads if I could that

00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:19,010
this process is possible so maybe some

00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:20,360
of you think yeah you guys are Facebook

00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,370
you just know everything and everything

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,370
is easy for you but no this was a team

00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:28,100
that was it was a startup company that

00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,649
was bought by Facebook and this company

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,049
this team did it all by yourself it

00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:35,000
wasn't some magic tooling that we have

00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:37,460
it's not some magic automation it was

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,340
just plain old folks go ahead and make

00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:43,850
cultural change in their team so it's

00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:48,049
possible and once you understand it you

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:50,240
would realize that there is no spoon any

00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:57,589
questions

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,589
[Applause]

00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:11,220
so first of all we lost zero people yeah

00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:12,929
so the question was how long would the

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,090
entire process took and how many people

00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:19,559
we lost a long among the way so we lost

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:22,679
zero people thankfully some of them did

00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:27,059
panic though but I think the whole

00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:29,460
process we began the conversation and we

00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:31,889
began to do the conversation really

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,889
slowly so the entire conversation part

00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:36,600
was taking a couple of months remember

00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:39,539
exactly i can get back to you on that

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,399
but it's really a matter of sensitivity

00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:43,710
to understand where people are standing

00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:45,899
on right so we did the conversation I

00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:48,929
think maybe four months I'm just

00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:50,700
throwing out and then starting actual

00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:53,779
conversation on when are we going to do

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:58,440
it and this talk maybe a couple of weeks

00:29:53,779 --> 00:30:00,450
from that point on it took us maybe two

00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,789
months don't want to sound like that to

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:05,899
just make the training and everything

00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:09,389
and the uncle we started to do maybe

00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:11,549
from one day then like one day for a

00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:13,580
couple of weeks and then two days for

00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:20,369
one week and after that it really it got

00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:22,139
much faster thanks oh alright yeah so

00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:24,539
they're kicking me off as you might see

00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:27,119
if you want to grab me I'm over the

00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:30,060
Facebook booth or just eating free food

00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:35,079
from everywhere thank you

00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:35,079
