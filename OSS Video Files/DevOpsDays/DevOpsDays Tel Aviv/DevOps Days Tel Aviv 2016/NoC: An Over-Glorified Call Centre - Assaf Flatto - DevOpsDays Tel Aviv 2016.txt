00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,750
that bill to myself and we're gonna t

00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,430
since 99 I think it remember blah blah

00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,530
we can all do that that's not what we're

00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,019
here to talk about and we'll go back

00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,699
knock I think knocks are an over

00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:22,099
glorified call center especially if

00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:23,390
you're working in a large company no

00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:26,570
offense to anybody working for a large

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:32,540
company most not people get a scenario

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:35,150
like this there you go knock should be

00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,980
green we get it get thread they open a

00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,650
page look at it look who's the person

00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,110
escalating really calling them my

00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:45,770
problem anymore now us as the technical

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,600
purple kind of hate this y2 a.m. in the

00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,000
morning oh the disk is full come on

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,140
can't you just rotate the logs why do we

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,320
have to wake up a dragon on you're

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:59,570
already a week so what do we need to do

00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,970
about that run first of all you get an

00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,100
issue run some tests find out what the

00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,320
issue you get playbooks for that yes you

00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,780
don't train them were you trained for

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,460
that issue yes most of the time snow

00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,380
that's why we get the escalated and wake

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,390
up in two o'clock in the morning if I

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,100
was training for that issue I do it if I

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,329
if it works solve the problem good lets

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,819
everybody sleep at night and we can go

00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:22,340
on together if it isn't let's escalate

00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:24,770
it if that's solves the problem case

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,840
closed now everybody benefits for that

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,399
one and what do we get from it I know

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm shorter than everybody else but the

00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:32,119
sorry they asked me to turn this down

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,909
from 40 minutes three nights so this is

00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,249
going to be very short how can we

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,960
achieve this issue of not waking people

00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:40,280
in the middle of night basically we

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,810
train the main power that will bring to

00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,639
the Knox these are technical people that

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,679
want to come and work what they get

00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:46,850
usually is this regard and not getting

00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:48,709
trained in what they're actually

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,740
managing or what they're supposed to do

00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:54,319
not being an operating center turned

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,549
into a let's just call this person so we

00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,389
train them in level 1 and level 2

00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:01,399
basically disk space processes for king

00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:03,380
or all kinds of regular shape that we

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,020
can actually prevent them from waking

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,490
people in dinner at 2am 4am or stopping

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,189
you from around a beer with your friends

00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:13,340
at nine o'clock SLA when you have to

00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:14,450
call somebody from your ops team usually

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,340
takes about 20 min

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,620
40 minutes he's out and about he's not

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,470
near a computer he gets to say oh I'll

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,760
deal with it in about when I get home

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,890
the note guy is already there he's near

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,760
the computer he sees the issue

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:32,900
escalation goes up 10 10 X 100 x who

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,610
knows retention employees knock people

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,010
don't actually stay long in one place

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,110
because they basically don't get much

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,630
tension don't get much training and

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,280
don't get the approval or the

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,290
interesting appears when you train them

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,819
you grow them you get a lower churn

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,620
because they'll see oh this is a company

00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,569
that invest in me it wants me to learn

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,790
and let me have tools and might actually

00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:54,769
move to the ops team my lab can move to

00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,690
the devops or to any engineering tool

00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:59,540
because you actually get trained to do

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,040
and manage the system you actually might

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,079
move into pre-sales if is it good in

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,150
that one so the progressing and they're

00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:07,269
keeping your turn employees in the

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,040
company and the knowledge within

00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:11,450
customer satisfaction I shouldn't just

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,060
explain this but basically if you

00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,220
haven't as a person responding to an

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,470
issue with your platform now instead of

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,709
weight will have any person dealing with

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,389
that if half an hour okay so you get

00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:25,250
your customer more satisfied you get

00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:28,549
them responsive and you get develop and

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:31,940
running win-win for everybody and the

00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:34,430
cost you basically hire people for the

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,100
knock at the lower wages but if you

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,019
train them they will save time for the

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,970
waking up and the own call hours for the

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,010
people that are expensive to the company

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,540
that come in the next morning groggy

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,799
waiting for the coffee and basically

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,450
going for the coffee every five minutes

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,950
because they can't keep their eyes open

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,230
because they spent the entire night

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:54,109
answering people who owe the Apaches

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,180
down oh the MySQL disk is filled so you

00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,799
have the low wage paid pages already

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,139
dealing with those issues and you don't

00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,849
have to have the higher ends groggy and

00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:05,450
making bad decisions pushing code or

00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:07,510
anything else that's it I'm done

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,510
you

00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,659
