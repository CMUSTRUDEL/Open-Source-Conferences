00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,640
hope your lunch was ok hey I'm Erica and

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:17,029
I'm going to talk about how we use chat

00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,650
ups to scale humans at big panda I'm

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:20,960
going to wait for the last one of you

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,929
and in the meanwhile a funny story about

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,669
rain so this was supposed to be my

00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:26,989
ending slide which was supposed to be

00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:28,550
really awesome because it would

00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:32,769
encourage you to go eat which you

00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,769
probably were the waiting for just

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,530
supposed to be the last talked before

00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:43,730
lunch but a well we had to change that

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,250
so a some of you might have seen me

00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:49,489
yesterday giving an ignite about a

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,410
confluent DevOps I'm Eric I'm a team

00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:54,050
leader and the community guy at big

00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,539
panda a where I've been working for the

00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,320
latest three years approximately an

00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:02,929
early 2014 when I first got two big pana

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,840
a big banner was already doing

00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:08,450
continuous delivery and meaning that

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,350
anything that got into the master branch

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:15,950
was deployable at any given time and the

00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:19,909
way we would do deploys was by a SS

00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:23,360
aging to a amazon instance a cold ender

00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:25,479
which was a deploy server and there we

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,820
used to run ansible playbooks on a

00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,799
ansible a git repository hey we were on

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,659
eight deployers by then we were small

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,930
and we managed approximately five

00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:41,479
microservices and we managed total 15

00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:44,180
servers so as I said we were kind of

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,009
small back then I but we had our

00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,630
problems right we were a small start-up

00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:50,060
and all you want to do is a small

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:53,360
start-up ease ship code as fast as

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,520
possible and deploy that a lot and one

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,770
of the biggest problems we had was a

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,229
lack of visibility and this caused

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,450
synchronization problem it was extremely

00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:05,329
common that a in the middle of the day

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,159
someone would just just yell yell at a

00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:09,019
mineral that small room where we're

00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,660
always sitting who the hell deployed

00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:12,960
something to something because we would

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,300
overwrite it charges

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,340
changes and this was not only annoying

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,470
this also causes problem because we

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,770
deployed incompatible versions of micro

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,110
servers to production of course over I

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:29,310
each other changes to staging servers

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:33,060
etc threats etc we also suffered from a

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,980
deploys not being reliable and this was

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,750
also due to the fact that as I said we

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,480
were a small start-up we had crappy

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,140
internet so our ssh connection to that

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,090
amazon instant would get disconnected a

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,740
or we just close our mac and their sleep

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,380
mode and that would be disconnected as

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,100
well and this was annoying because we

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:55,170
sometimes did not know if a deploy

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,420
completed successfully or not and not

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,050
only that a we couldn't really debug

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,550
this at a convenient way even if we

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,470
wanted to show each other the errors

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,470
were receiving we were physically have

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,480
to go again the amazing distance of a

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,630
small room to another person showing

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,120
that error I was really annoying the

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,400
last problem we had was that ansible was

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,340
not common knowledge people kept doing

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,320
the same silly mistakes about what

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,420
parameters to call for our ansible

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,340
playbooks and you had to learn I learn

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,230
about how they work in general before

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,550
you could deploy which is kind of

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,160
knowing when onboarding new day

00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:35,970
employees as well and we used to bug or

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:40,920
our DevOps guy about that every time so

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,930
hello so a so he got annoyed by that and

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,600
and whenever you get annoyed by

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,140
something you try to solve that in bash

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,230
so a this is a guy our amazing DevOps

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,540
guy and and what he wrote was extremely

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,450
simple but extremely useful he wrote a

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:02,130
bash wrapper for ansible so instead of

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:04,230
this extremely long parameter if a first

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,410
command that we used to use just to

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,780
deploy a app called that api which you

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,000
can guess what it does a so instead of

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,100
that we would just use deploy a sage

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,690
which he wrote and it just named the

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,540
name of the app that we want it to do

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,370
and optionally a have a lot of

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,530
parameters like the environment we want

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,889
to do if it's a specific branch etc etc

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,530
and this small batch wrapper was

00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:31,409
awesome because it had a decent help

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:34,469
like all bash things and it prevented

00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:36,960
people from doing silly things so it

00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:39,659
solved the problem of people did not

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,150
have to know about how ansible and how

00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:45,360
our deployment works they could just use

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,610
that entry point the deploy sage a and

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,409
that's it can really still had a

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,509
synchronization problem we still had

00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:54,360
those a shout out so who the hell

00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:56,879
deployed that and ruin my code and we

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,300
still had a problem of not reliable

00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:03,360
deploys disconnections etc so we set out

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,789
to fix that as well and there's a lot of

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,430
cool unix tools like bash and there's

00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:15,750
also t max oh hey and there's awesome

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:18,930
clickers as well yay so and the next

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,500
step in our RM deploy evolution was

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,789
using team access all those those

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,969
disconnection and issues so what we did

00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:29,939
we wrap that ssh logging to enter that

00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:32,879
deploy server with 80 marks so anybody

00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,770
connecting to that server we would

00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,680
automatically reconnect to his previous

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:41,039
session thus not so not suffering that

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,020
much from our crappy internet and not

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,389
only that we use local users for each

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,000
user so we can continue debugger all

00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,979
sessions we could show those sessions to

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,529
other people and we still use that with

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:56,789
a symlink playbook repository so we all

00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:59,610
deployed from the same place and finally

00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:03,360
a small but extremely useful tool called

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,879
marsh or or a mobile shell which is

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,330
basically a wraparound SSH that suffers

00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,159
disconnections better and that's kind of

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,490
mandatory if you want to work on train

00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:16,770
Wi-Fi so this solved the problem of this

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,330
connection it helped us debug because

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,139
you can search that smokes buffer or

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:24,029
timox a buffer and a it was really cool

00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,729
it helped us debug because we could show

00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:28,919
other people the problems as well but it

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,930
did not help the problem that we still

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,889
over each other's changes and deployed

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,379
incompatible versions a so we decided to

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,620
use chat ops 2 because that was all the

00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,770
hype this is really cool

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:45,840
we have to use this right so a we wrote

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,520
a chatbot using a you but which is a

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,740
chat bot framework from github which

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,750
really rocks its kind of old if you

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,940
compared to all the new shiny things

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,800
that are coming up right now it but it

00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,350
does everything and everything extremely

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,070
good it can connect everything from IRC

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:05,310
HipChat slack or even skype and so we

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:08,560
wrote a hip chat bot using you but and

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:11,440
yoga is running CoffeeScript not so yay

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,919
and and we call that beam bought the

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,240
chat pod a being what was limited to

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,699
deploying only to staging servers

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,889
because we weren't really sure if this

00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:24,340
will work or not it's kind of new thing

00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:26,590
chat ups at least it was for us and and

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,110
behind the scene bimba used to actually

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,240
connect to our Jenkins instance and that

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,970
used to run our ansible playbooks like

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,979
with it before manually a beam but could

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:39,250
do a lot of cool things he could query

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:41,979
past results and past deploy so we could

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,200
like say I am what's deployed on that

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,780
staging server and get a list or who

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,750
deployed that component less and we get

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:52,419
a list of that as well and that failed

00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,380
because a it didn't really solve our

00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:58,930
synchronization problem and and

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:02,039
basically not a lot of people were using

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:06,070
HipChat and it really wasn't that hip

00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:08,020
and people were not it didn't gain that

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:11,560
visibility are you supposed to gain from

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,419
chat ups and it installed the real pain

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,199
we have which was production deploying

00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:18,940
to production and not enough people were

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,889
involved with actually deploying it

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,250
developing it he only had treat

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:26,940
contributors and and that mainly was

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:31,660
because people really hated CoffeeScript

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:34,330
so this was around mid-2015 we were

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:37,240
growing a lot and we were around 15 deep

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,070
layers by now we had 15 micro services

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,630
and we were managing approximately 40

00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:46,029
servers by now and and so we said okay

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,940
we're we're serious company right we

00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:50,510
will get growing and we're getting way

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,820
way way

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,590
mature than we were before so we were

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,180
not able to solve this with chat ups

00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,910
that's probably a fad or something like

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,870
that right so let's solve this with Chad

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:05,600
so a we created a slag channel and

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,360
needless to say we jumped on the slack

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,120
wagon and ditch tip check really really

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,980
fast because stack rules hey so we

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,030
created slack channel which we called

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,530
deployment blocks and as you can see

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,440
from the samples there on the right and

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,510
we would manually go into that channel

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,850
and notify about locking locking could

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:30,050
be a component it could be an

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:32,090
environment or a server and this very

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,270
quickly escalated to be totally unusable

00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:38,720
because a people forgot to lock people

00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:42,440
forgot to unlock a people lock ambiguous

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,640
things like everything and back because

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:50,060
humans are and stupid so a we set up to

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,860
fix that again and and we weren't able

00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,350
to fix it with chat else we try to chat

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,990
so we wanted to try chat ups again and

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,660
this time we gather requirements on

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,600
slack we argued a lot we are very good

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,780
at that in Israel about what we need our

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,940
chat ups but to do and then we took a

00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:11,330
hackathon evening at big panda and we

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,370
rewrote our a chat bot from scratch and

00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,740
we will still using the humor framework

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,230
which still rocks and we call the boat

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,440
called Robin because he's a kick-ass

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,510
sidekick robot and and this time we

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,330
wrote that in JavaScript as opposed to

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,490
CoffeeScript and that enabled us to use

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,890
all or other nodejs microservices

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,690
standards like a unified way to do unit

00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,180
tests and integration tests and unified

00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:39,520
way to deploy this afterwards manage

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:41,960
configurations etc and it worked

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,620
everybody went on board with this

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,170
directly I can really express how fast

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,150
this took off it was literally we

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:53,030
deployed this we show this once and then

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:55,460
everybody started using that and and

00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,860
what Robin would do a would manage our

00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,740
deployment logs he would actually deploy

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,379
to production as opposed to only staging

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,720
servers before and a

00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:07,819
a lot of the stupid human errors and the

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,609
syntax was extremely similar to the bash

00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:13,639
script that we talked about before so

00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:17,269
and the reason that Robin really is

00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:19,459
succeeded I was that it was very very

00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:21,739
easy to manage this as opposed to the

00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:24,499
previous spot beam one if you had a

00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:27,829
problem with be what you would talk to

00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:29,989
the lead developer and that late

00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:32,449
developer would either ignore you or fix

00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:34,699
that is so that that was part of my

00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:38,089
problem as well but this time we managed

00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:39,799
all the planning and issues etc using

00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:42,139
github issues which is very lightweight

00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:45,769
as opposed to doing in something like

00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:48,139
JIRA and about half if the entire rd

00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:52,039
were actually contributing code to Robin

00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:54,649
and almost all the R&D were involved in

00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:57,529
opening the issues and discussing the

00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,939
different features are probably as I

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:00,919
said before this was really in

00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:03,889
JavaScript as opposed to confer skirt

00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:06,619
that really helped because I loved it or

00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:09,229
hated both hey everybody knows

00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:11,919
JavaScript and it was much much easier

00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:14,869
for everybody to contribute code to it

00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:17,389
as i said before slack was so much

00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:19,549
popular than HipChat everybody was using

00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:21,859
it we were there all the time so it gain

00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:23,659
visibility directly hey we also use a

00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:25,999
lot of different human scripts which are

00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,739
basically like small plugins or snippet

00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:30,649
that you can use which connect to

00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:34,100
everything anything with an API or

00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:39,139
internal thing in services external

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:40,970
wounds etc as of today we cannot really

00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:43,039
function properly without robbing we do

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,350
everything with it and it's an

00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,899
integrated part of our development cycle

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,809
whenever you think about a new features

00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:53,569
or new flows we also always think about

00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:56,600
how to do the chat up side of that flow

00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:59,689
and we're around 30 deployers by now we

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,839
have more than 30 micro services and we

00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:05,359
manage approximately 160 services on a

00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,429
servers on amazon and we do

00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:11,089
approximately hundred daily deploys and

00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:12,289
logs using robbing so I I kind of

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,050
explained everything in the air right

00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:17,570
now so I'm going to show some examples

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,149
and let's start with something extremely

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,760
simple I can tell Robin and this could

00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:25,070
be in a DM or if I mention him in one of

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,260
the channels where he resides please

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:31,310
deploy splinter which is by chance

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:34,279
another pot and and he will deploy that

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:36,829
notify me and anybody in that context

00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:39,560
whether it's a channel or a DM of what

00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:42,350
he deployed so here we can see it uses a

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,850
lot of sensible defaults so develop is

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,760
the default branch unless you specify

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:50,420
others stage is the default environment

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,709
unless you specify others so a I don't

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,430
need to do much to get something

00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:57,410
deployed and on the other hand it's

00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,620
extremely simple and I get as much

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:02,750
information as I need back from me and

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,730
another thing a when it when it goes to

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,950
production we can see here that Oleg

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,500
wanted to deploy our front and the app

00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:13,420
to production so all he had to do was

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:16,430
say deploy frontier to prod and and

00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,500
Robin would actually notify Oleg of the

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,810
last commit made that is going to be

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,060
deployed it just in case there were some

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:26,020
kind of mash up or is about to deploy

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,390
something that it isn't isn't sorry his

00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:32,750
not only that we also confirm with Oleg

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:35,630
and by asking i like to a reply with

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,779
ship it with a extremely random integer

00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:42,200
afterwards so here we minimize human

00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:45,920
errors by making sure that the deployer

00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,350
has the other needed information not

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,480
only that we add a confirmation step if

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:54,649
you want to deploy to production so we

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,920
don't deploy it with typos and is a

00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:01,190
great clicker so here's another example

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,079
of minimizing human errors simply by not

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,120
doing what the human about what the

00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,949
stupid human were trying to do so here

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,110
Roman is trying to deploy a component

00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:11,540
called envy to our performance

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,310
environment and a Robin would just not

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:17,839
do that because that was already locked

00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:20,750
by another user another example is to

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,320
provide useful a feedback and context

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:26,050
relevant so a Norwich by chance is here

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,630
in the audience I tried to do something

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,220
failed utterly and

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:34,190
it got a pat on the back and saying and

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,930
it wasn't easy and a link to the Jenkins

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,570
job where all this fails which he has

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,430
the relevant context to fix that as

00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,860
opposed to the second message where we

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,230
can see that everything worked she gets

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,110
a pat on the back and saying that she

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:50,270
was very freeing great and she doesn't

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,730
get any Jenkins link because it works

00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:57,290
there's no need to debug this so less

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:59,240
less content a another thing is you

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,339
should have your a chat bot to be as

00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,890
square bowl as possible to be as

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:06,980
relevant as possible and to do that you

00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:09,500
can here we can see I can ask for all

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,350
the logs and typically as we do a lot of

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,180
deployments all the time the list is way

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:20,000
more than those for Lance's you can see

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:22,370
right now so am I most likely would want

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,620
only the details that details that are

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,899
relevant to me so I can also do get all

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,240
my logs and here we see another small

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:32,060
example so instead of just not replying

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,339
because I don't have any logs Robin is a

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:39,080
bit more humane and saying he says that

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:41,120
no locks are found a another thing that

00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,029
you should do is you should ensure name

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,000
spacing for your chat ops commands and

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:49,400
this helps for a couple of things first

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,950
for helping a most of the chat chat bot

00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,779
frameworks have a built-in hair help

00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,580
that you can use if you type help

00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,740
without anything you will spit out all

00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,650
the commands that that part can do which

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,480
user is a lot and it's also queryable so

00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,459
if you pass something to that afterwards

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,650
it will filter and show the help

00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:10,010
relevant only for died so here we can

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:12,770
see that Robin tells me all of the OD OD

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,189
is on demand a relevant commands that we

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:18,020
have and what I can do that so

00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:19,730
namespacing helps for humans because we

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,939
get context and it's easy to search

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:25,280
helps and it also helps to build the

00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:28,400
chat ups and reg access which you have

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,740
to do in order to build a chat ups so if

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,230
we look just on the upper box that's

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,370
basically how you do a interaction with

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,130
a human you

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:41,000
a communicate with reg ex which is very

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:46,010
similar to human life and a basically

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,020
what I say that if a he the robot gets a

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,820
DM or is mentioned and after that

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,520
something comes with block and a word

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,080
that does not start with space and has

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,040
at least one letter because you all knew

00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,250
that because it's reg ex and I do

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,530
something with that right and what we

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,660
see in a bottom box is a unit test for

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,030
that and that is using a very cool

00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,580
package for node called a hula test

00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:14,600
helper which gives you a rapper to em

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:19,490
test and bought interactions in a very

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:23,330
humane way so here I can see that I'm

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:26,630
asking the u-boat esta Albert does say

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:29,600
that the user foo said who bought lock

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:32,360
bar and afterwards what I'm expecting to

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,820
hear from back from the board is that

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,890
it's already locked at stage by zone

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,200
which is the kind of setup I did the

00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:42,380
line before so this really helps because

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,940
you will always make mistakes in regular

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,270
expressions because there's nothing

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,850
regular about regular expressions sorry

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,550
and and in absolute you get code

00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:56,450
coverage and solve those pesky stuff

00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:58,900
smells typos that yeah a another really

00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:03,080
cool thing we're using Robin for is our

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:05,059
operational em mayor needs so a probably

00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,570
you're all using graph Anna which is

00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:11,150
awesome here instead of item are here I

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,500
wanted to get a girl phonograph so

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,800
instead of opening that in the browser

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,929
he's asking Robin to get everything from

00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,110
the latest three hours for correlation

00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:23,390
engine and what's extremely good about

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:26,270
this a except it's the graph and graphs

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,940
are always good that and this is a

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,820
served by s3 buckets so this is saved

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,860
later so although a what hero is

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,679
relevant for that our like three hours

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,240
before that our when we see this the day

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,490
after is still what happened when he

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,990
asked for that and that's extremely

00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:47,660
helpful for a operations war rooms so if

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:51,200
I tomorrow was woken up at 2a

00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,030
he's a have still not got to his

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,920
computer he can look up things on his

00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:58,040
phone and get kind of a grasp of the

00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,110
situation of the system not only that as

00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,000
other people's help a wake up and try to

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,890
help them they can get on to speed

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,200
really really fast because the city they

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:09,620
can see that evolution of this incident

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:13,280
in our operations war chat room so this

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:15,290
is extremely helpful and another thing

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,230
that is important for your chat off spot

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:20,180
is you should never spam too much

00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,060
there's kind of things of a chat BOTS

00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:26,390
fatigue if you have a public room with

00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,310
with a chat up spot that it gives too

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,910
much information people will stop stop

00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:36,200
reading that and and and we had that

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:38,780
case in with help commands because they

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,240
help command output was real really long

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,190
and people kept doing those in public

00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,350
rooms and that's all we had in that

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,290
public rooms just the capabilities of

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,030
that bot so instead of that it will

00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:52,790
simply reply in private with all the

00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:56,050
usage that's by the way something we got

00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:58,760
a merge backed into who but so yay

00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:02,390
another thing you should not spam is of

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,790
course a sensitive things so a Roman

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,920
here signed up a new organization to our

00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,300
performance environment and there's no

00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,580
need for everybody to get his

00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:16,760
credentials so those are sent in a TM

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:19,550
instead and almost lastly a we use Robin

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,460
to help us we were all small day-to-day

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:24,230
task we use and this helps us both with

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,630
visibility so other people can see this

00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:29,450
as well and it's simply saved search

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:32,180
time and the first example is me asking

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:34,310
who is uncle and directly I get that

00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,460
result for that that of course goes to

00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:40,070
the pagerduty API and receives as for me

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,130
and the other is actually and we can

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,660
enable and disable feature targets for

00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:47,120
organizations to our customers live and

00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,310
instead of you know connecting to the

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,230
database via SSH we can do that here and

00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:53,510
it's the chair email perfect because

00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,680
it's visible so everybody can see that

00:21:53,510 --> 00:22:00,290
it was done and it's lightweight and

00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:05,360
easy to do that hello

00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:08,540
seriously just with the good one anyways

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:13,640
so the usage of your bod should always

00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:15,710
be fun if you mention Robin in a way

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,260
that you have a type or anything that he

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,030
understands that he/she understands that

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,530
you wanted something from him but you

00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,660
had a type or something he does not

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:28,160
understand he will reply with random

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,840
motor response says hey so he's kind of

00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,720
a summary of the things we learn and

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,280
most of them the hard way hey your bot

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:40,400
will be down you'll do typos you will do

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,320
stupid typos that JavaScript will ensure

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,440
that it will a fail in production and

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:49,130
not only that way hello and not only

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,780
that and you'll make things that are

00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,100
incompatible you thought you did

00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,890
something that we're working like a

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,640
conversation reg ex and we won't work so

00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:01,160
I say that you and deployed your bot and

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,550
with code that crush that but you need

00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,350
some other way to deploy that bot is so

00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:09,950
you can get back up again not only that

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,960
you need a kind of a parallel process so

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,850
anything you wanted a toy you can deploy

00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,370
without chat ups but you should always

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,830
encourage the chat ups way to deploy

00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:21,140
that you should always reuse your

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:24,260
existing deploying syntax and process

00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:28,130
because this really helps people to get

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:30,380
on board with using chat ups at the

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,240
Chado spot a you should be able to run

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,910
the butt of locally on staging

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,920
environments you but actually provides

00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:39,380
that for us you get like a local rebel

00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,570
in your shell where you can talk to the

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,060
bots and it's super helpful for

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,760
iterating and developing new chat

00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,950
interactions and you should also deploy

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,140
that on a staging environment because

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:55,310
you will discover things that he didn't

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:58,010
locally like incompatible slack API etc

00:23:55,310 --> 00:24:01,340
etc you should make contributing to the

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:04,280
boss's ed bott sorry as easy as possible

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:07,150
and fun this means bootstrapping

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:10,670
development environment and making em

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:12,780
super fast super easy to unit test to

00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,190
the bots etcetera etcetera

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,440
lastly you should set up your own

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,800
company about skeleton so the people can

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,080
set up new BOTS fast and this really

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,950
helps for a creating proof of concepts

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,570
and creating multiple BOTS and here's a

00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,150
list of a couple of more bots that we

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,010
have in big panda so we have a a grocery

00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:35,490
switch list called super panel where we

00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:38,040
can ask for a more chocolates coffee or

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:41,730
whatever and we have about called Gordon

00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:44,970
which is awesome way who helps our sales

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,920
and support team with cases etc and we

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:50,370
used to have a bar called bellboy which

00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,080
used to open our office door but a

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,960
that's also something important you

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,360
should as with legacy code be able to

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,790
throw those bots out the door unintended

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,610
if they no longer work as they should

00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:06,330
and we also had to have a bar called

00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:10,440
splinter which rewards people for fixing

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:12,270
lint problems in our code and that's

00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:19,380
kind of it I'm open for questions if you

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:22,340
have anything else several instances of

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:26,150
the bone regarding the ball skeleton

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:29,850
valuation provide some templating engine

00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:32,190
to produce functionality and integrate

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:35,700
that functionality to it next to their

00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:38,820
existing book so I'll just recap on the

00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,670
question fix me if I got this wrong yes

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:44,040
if the company is skeleton but adds

00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,890
functionality easy to just been bought

00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,290
from create new boats so typically able

00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,360
to create new BOTS a so you can test

00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:54,030
wrong with things and you should

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,760
probably create bots per domain so you

00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,590
should have a diploid lot but a 20 penor

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,480
office store that would be extremely

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:05,270
insane to ask our deployment so hey

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,150
they are BOTS Calvin creates a new bar

00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:12,320
it's jump yeah and I don't know jsf that

00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:16,400
we were able to deploy yes sir are the

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,490
shells you complete the patient or

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,280
subject actually depends on your chat

00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:24,200
mother because if you do second eyes you

00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,080
can get out of the three sure it's

00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,540
possible to do shadows as well we

00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,360
haven't used it yet and we have an issue

00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,700
open on the github for our pot and we'll

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,770
get there someday but yeah it depends on

00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,450
what you can do and if you provide a

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,570
decent health you can get by without

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,730
water filtration and but yeah you can do

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:51,190
that coming on your chat ever more

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:51,190
questions even holding thank you

00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,300
Oh

00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:02,910
about that these relative abundance of

00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:02,910
work make sure they work

00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,580
which thing is with the

00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:28,039
stem cells

00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:30,620
so I make up the question he asked if we

00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:32,600
deploy mommy we not by the chat BOTS say

00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,549
if we destroyed the chat bot if that

00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,100
uses the same walking mechanism which

00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:40,029
part of the reason to use use the chat

00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:44,899
box so know if it doesn't do that and

00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:51,590
unfortunately more questions feel free

00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:54,139
you should ask stupid questions yes how

00:27:51,590 --> 00:28:01,480
did you feel the water the process to

00:27:54,139 --> 00:28:04,990
keep some autonomy Bonnie I'm going sir

00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,140
different the process flow could you

00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:10,090
stay went to do with the Pompeii way

00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,730
when we implemented are deployed forces

00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:16,720
the first we have the Detroit script

00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:20,590
which was run from the work station on

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:24,040
to the different tale belliston then we

00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:26,980
just got the boat to use the same screen

00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:34,000
on into the dry run flag and after we

00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:38,110
saw several Iran's working fails then we

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,690
give Jenkins the board some autonomy to

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:43,600
join the call to staging and after that

00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:47,470
all production and moving forward two

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,220
different models Oh what water before

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:53,429
you ask yes how ferry recap if I

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,620
understood correctly did we give the but

00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:59,200
everything and all the capabilities and

00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:02,410
up in front four to be tested with a

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,780
limited functionality so we try to test

00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:06,669
a limited functionality but we kind of

00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,110
dropped that very fast because that that

00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:10,179
was part of the reason that the first

00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,860
one was killed because we didn't deploy

00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:14,770
to production so people what kind of

00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,929
used to separate processes and the most

00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,480
important one is always production so

00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:21,700
you should do something with a drive by

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,320
at least once right yes they done a

00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,330
complete you screw up your deployment

00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,700
but you shouldn't women yourself too

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,220
much from it i buy it because it will

00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:35,040
stop you any wool and make the button on

00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,040
and use pay more

00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,730
so the question was how do we manage

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,490
permissions and who has permissions to

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:49,220
deploy everyone as of now we don't have

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,740
an acls order is something that does is

00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:55,040
smugly and little connected to our chat

00:29:51,740 --> 00:30:00,580
and do that even you know our sales guy

00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,580
and God forbid yes more questions

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,289
so the question was to chat box or

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:16,010
Telestream work have building and

00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:17,600
resolutions pictures so dark like after

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,549
cerebral script that does it for you

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,330
there's even a Yuma skip that connects

00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:25,460
to Elda and so yeah there are a lot of

00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:28,900
those functionalities if the present way

00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,900
you want to use it potable

00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:45,570
that's an excellent option for debugging

00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:47,610
so the question was hey how do you know

00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:51,450
that a deployment worked or failed and

00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:55,470
we have any fun and possibilities of a

00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:58,530
finish McCoy so we notify on upon every

00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:01,020
success and we run ansible so in your

00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,030
character code and it's just we run it

00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:05,700
by Jenkins we can debugging see all the

00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:12,420
output at getting this keep it fair so

00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:15,090
that covers it for us now we don't we

00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,040
don't you you know husband he asked if

00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:19,530
we get output from the bottom themselves

00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,230
no we don't we provide a link to Jenkins

00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:27,990
with outfit because that just spending

00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:30,360
too much more there are a lot of other

00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:33,330
frameworks especially as well as Excel

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,610
yuba either all a new shiny stuff and

00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:38,660
there are a lot of had hosted services

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:44,390
that big chap just spots for you as well

00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:44,390
more questions yes

00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:52,299
so and he asked what the sales and

00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:54,729
support but it bought us so he gathers

00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:57,789
now say you're sitting with a prospect

00:31:54,729 --> 00:32:00,460
customer and gathers things from saves

00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:02,950
foursome whatever those dudes do and

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:10,349
help them to be more relevant have more

00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:10,349
information a case history it's a for

00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:17,669
one last question this is going to be

00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:17,669
the best question so one less question

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,799
