Title: DevOps Coping Strategy #1 - Corey Quinn
Publication date: 2015-11-01
Playlist: DevOps Days Tel Aviv 2015
Description: 
	http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-telaviv/

Corey has a long and storied history as a consultant -- long, in that every year he did it felt like three years, and storied, in that he's got a few. Prior to his current role as Director of DevOps at FutureAdvisor, he spent the past two years at Taos, where he served as a systems architect, ad-hoc recruiter, advocate for driving transformational change throughout organizations, and (due to a misunderstanding around what a "standup meeting" really was) an improvisational comic. One of the early developers behind Saltstack, Corey also has a rich history of contributing to various open source projects.

Corey's hobbies include motorcycles, wearing suits, and drinking whiskey-- it's a shame that they all don't work well together. He lives in San Francisco with his wife and two rodents of unusual size masquerading as dogs.

Shalom now that I've exhausted my Hebrew

00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,839
let's talk a little bit about DevOps I

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,730
live in San Francisco I don't I get to

00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,650
come here maybe two maybe once or twice

00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,329
every couple of years it's nice to be

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,060
out in Israel so thank you for having me

00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:30,069
in DevOps we often talk about the pets

00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,200
versus cattle analogy when you have a

00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:34,149
pet you name it you nurse it back to

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,340
health when it gets sick when you have a

00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:38,379
cow you window and it gets sick you

00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,050
shoot it in the head and you get

00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:43,390
yourself another cow someone at piston

00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,039
cloud had a great idea about this but

00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,289
but all I saw was drinking whiskey

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,660
because at the time I was drinking

00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:51,609
whiskey and I missed his larger point so

00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,859
I figured that would probably wind up

00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:55,739
making a better talk than going into

00:00:53,859 --> 00:01:01,659
something much more in depth and

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:04,150
profound so let's talk about whiskey

00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:09,340
pairings with various DevOps type of

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:11,290
challenges when you wind up doing

00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,750
deployments the idea is it shouldn't be

00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,700
something big and momentous it should be

00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,670
something that you wind up doing on a

00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,220
consistent ongoing basis smaller changes

00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,620
so you know what to expect it's not

00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,510
notable it's not special it's something

00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,520
that you do all the time every day

00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,850
that's why I recommend pairing it with

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,730
eagle rare it costs between 80 to a

00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,860
hundred shekels a bottle and it's very

00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,720
decent you can have it every day you've

00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,750
heard of table wine this is table

00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,120
whiskey on a related note when you wind

00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,640
up monitoring systems your first web

00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,640
server to your 5000 web server it should

00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,140
all follow a very consistent process

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,360
monitoring things by hand and adding

00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,520
them into nagios manually doesn't work

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,410
that's why I like Johnnie Walker Black

00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,420
Label it doesn't matter what crappy

00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,930
airport bar i'm in from Boston to

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,360
Budapest I get the same thing bar to bar

00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,550
year to year it's amazingly consistent

00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,000
there's a process engineering lesson

00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:12,460
there we talk a lot about blameless

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,200
post-mortems here in DevOps one of the

00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,370
challenges

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,620
so is it doesn't mean you get to

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,510
abdicate responsibility sometimes when

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,790
you screw the pooch no one's going to

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,610
call you out but you know what you did

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,269
which is why you have to drink this the

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,220
first sip tastes marginally acceptable

00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:33,030
by the third or the fourth it's oh god

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:39,150
this is awful can I send it back no you

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:41,760
drink it because you deserve it now I'm

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,500
not much of a developer and as a DevOps

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,480
role I shouldn't necessarily have to be

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,239
the times that I write code is either

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,620
glue code or open-source projects so

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,720
when I have to write something bespoke

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,760
from scratch I'm not going to

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,010
necessarily write what you would expect

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,410
which is like moonshine an illegal

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,840
illegally made alcohol that sometimes is

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:05,489
awesome and sometimes will actually kill

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,049
you so some people even at this

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,730
conference have worked in shops that say

00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:10,680
that they don't believe in configuration

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,620
management instead they either roll

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,940
their own or they wind up just not doing

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,530
everything by hand because we don't have

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,359
time or we don't believe in it I have

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,970
exactly one thing for you to drink at

00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:23,880
that point it's my favorite alcoholic

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,579
drink it's called a lot and you just

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,560
drink until the hurting stops it's 2015

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:35,730
there's no reason not to automate things

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:38,310
at scale so definitions of DevOps

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,750
include a really shitty variant of I'm

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,030
going to spend half my time doing

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,859
operations and the other half of my time

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,680
writing code on the core application

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:48,329
that's not DevOps that's two jobs you're

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,760
going to suck at at least one of them

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,769
which is why I like wine coolers they

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,319
say Jack Daniels on them but they're not

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,750
wine they're not whiskey they're just

00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,440
shitty at at least one of those in this

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,440
case both

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,130
for those who don't know what this is

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,770
what I'm talking about here step into my

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,120
get talk tomorrow but effectively this

00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,510
means you have reached you've just

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,280
reached out and changed history at that

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,850
point you've made everyone else's job

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:23,370
measurably worse at that point please

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:28,010
just yeah this starts by making you

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,010
blind and ends by actually killing you

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,720
this is sort of the holy grail of what

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,360
we're actually striving to do when we

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,790
wind up doing something and building a

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,960
system that won't let you do anything to

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,790
her if ecclesia that's the goal that's

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,280
the time where I like to drink something

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,290
actually really nice I go with the

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,880
lagavulin but not everyone prefers it

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,040
smoky you either love it or you hate it

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,960
but whatever you like that's what you

00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,700
wind up getting once you've wound up

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,030
succeeding because you found the Grail

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,740
and as a last bit of advice it's not

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,870
always about what you're drinking

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,820
sometimes it's about what you get other

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,150
people to drink thank you for listening

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,150
to me

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,840
