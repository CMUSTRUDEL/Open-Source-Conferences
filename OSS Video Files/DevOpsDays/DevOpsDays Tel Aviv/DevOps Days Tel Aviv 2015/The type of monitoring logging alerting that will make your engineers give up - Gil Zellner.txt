The type of monitoring/logging/alerting that will make your engineers give up

Bad monitoring/alerting/logging made me very frustrated in some of my previous positions. It seems that almost nobody gets this exactly right. This will be a 5 minute talk with the most annoying issues I've come across and how to fix them.

About the speaker - Gil Zellner

Cloudify Developer, former ops at Gett, minor league basketball player and Technion survivor.

	00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,100
thank you today we're going to be

00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,900
talking about the link between yin

00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,150
you're monitoring blogging and alerting

00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,370
policies to the motivation of your

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,530
engineers to solve problems which i

00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,870
think is you know incredibly important

00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,270
so here's the problem whenever you try

00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,130
to talk to your superiors about this

00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,539
which usually get is this look of we

00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,820
don't have any time for that our

00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:37,129
attention span is too small but this is

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,739
only five minutes so it should be pretty

00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:41,629
easy shouldn't it no so why is

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,070
monitoring so important monitoring is a

00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:45,559
big part of your life or your production

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,390
engineer basically you see it in the

00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,039
bathroom in bed with while your

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,420
significant other is looking over your

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,659
shoulder asking you to come to bed

00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:57,559
already and any of us have actually done

00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:59,359
that yeah so so this is what you look on

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:04,010
your first on call especially he's a

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:09,890
junior and uh well this is what you look

00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:13,219
like after a while go well yes and and

00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:16,610
that's that's really the case and this

00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:18,469
kind of motivation drop happens and it's

00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,170
because you're just monitoring things

00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:25,070
with you all the time and you kind of

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:31,490
need to learn to control that anyway so

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:34,189
what the hell so essentially why does

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:38,780
this motivation drop because either

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:40,250
you're frustrated or your yeah sorry so

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,990
one of the bad things people do is that

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,490
we alert all the errors basically we

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,320
lurk for everything and because we alert

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,170
for everything what actually happened

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,640
this will get alert fatigue which is

00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,609
would basically cause you to kind of

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,990
care less which kind of sucks so what

00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:55,460
you need to do with this ly alert only

00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,960
things that either are that are

00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,490
basically actionable business breaking

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,299
and absolutely cannot wait till morning

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:05,210
and the reason you can't have people do

00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:06,530
that every night is because this is what

00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,190
you look like the morning after a

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,290
production event and that kind of sucks

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,300
because use a lot of productivity for

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,840
people that you you know pay a lot of

00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,690
money for

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:22,250
so that's basically the case so another

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,450
thing that people do is that they have

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,099
like with this one team that does

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,810
monitoring but anybody else is kind of

00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:28,910
like waiting for next for the next day

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,549
or 2nd here or whatever and what this

00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,900
does is that other teams have limited

00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:34,640
motivation to actually prevent problems

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,590
and everything that happens is that the

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,370
first thing burns out faster so what you

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,110
do instead is that you get this like

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,030
only person who actually can fix the

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,459
problem should get alerted and the other

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,959
people shouldn't be nobody should get

00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,690
loose sleep for things that they can do

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,329
nothing about so what they usually do to

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,209
try to fix this they kind of alert

00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:57,769
everyone so when you alert everyone

00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,450
basically get tragedy of the Commons

00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,489
which basically means that nobody cares

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,980
about anything and basically it's

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:07,340
somebody else's problem so that

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,980
shouldn't be the case everybody should

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,260
do one call if everybody doesn't call

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:18,889
people would be doing less of it over

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:20,329
time and another thing that people do

00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,799
which is horrible is because they don't

00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:22,910
know what two logs that they log all the

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,859
things you get a needle in a haystack

00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,299
syndrome and basically it takes you who

00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:27,590
are time to find the information to fix

00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:30,290
the problems that you're not even sure

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,620
that you have and that's pretty horrible

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,709
and the solution is that you need to

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,769
kinda forced your developers to think

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:42,500
monitoring through before you will when

00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:44,630
you design the system so no more null

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,480
pointer exceptions in Java with no wheel

00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,609
error in them and this is another thing

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,590
people measure things the wrong way this

00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:53,060
is how you measure engine strength that

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,880
you measure horsepower does anybody here

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,819
still riding horse to work and we for

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,380
some reason still do this with cars and

00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:03,919
another thing we do is that we sometimes

00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,540
measure the wrong things and so you can

00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,609
look at this and say okay why are we

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,389
still measuring these things like CPU or

00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:13,180
memory for cific host and you know auto

00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:16,459
scale on that and stuff like that so

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,019
these kind of problems need to be

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,519
accounted for your system changes over

00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:22,280
time you need self correcting metrics

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,110
now many of you are probably saying that

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,940
you could probably buy this and this

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,349
stuff already exists on the market well

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,370
it usually does but many of you aren't

00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:31,220
still aren't doing that

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,900
so this is kind of cool to talk so

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,729
another thing that I liked it point out

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,530
is that metrics the one of the metrics

00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,300
that netflix has is that they measure

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,090
how many times a minute people actually

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,590
click the play button which is pretty

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,290
cool it's like this one metric it tells

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,620
you everything about your service and

00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,870
that's it I copy laws stuff from a lot

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,389
of other meddling from stats craft

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:57,100
this is my email and Twitter handle and

00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:57,100
