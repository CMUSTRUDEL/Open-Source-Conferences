With enough scale - everything is a problem, with Facebook scale everything requires extremely accurate design in order to meet the enormous production needs.

In this talk I'll try and cover how Facebook handles one of it's biggest challenges - monitoring a huge scale environment.

What tools & systems are at play
How we leverage our monitoring infra to solve production issues
How developers and devops share oncall rotation
How we treat monitoring as data
What we choose to be paged and what not
Compare Facebook infrastructure to other open source tools out there
