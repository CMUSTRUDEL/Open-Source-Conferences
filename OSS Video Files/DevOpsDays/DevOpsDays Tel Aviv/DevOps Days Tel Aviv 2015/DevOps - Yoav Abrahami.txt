I have been asked to give a talk at TEDx event about DevOps. Being from a technical background asked to talk about a technical subject such as DevOps for non-technical audience forced me to distill what DevOps really is - a shift in a culture, but more then that, a shift in responsibility.

Responsibility is key to building a successful organization. However, with the traditional way of distributing responsibility based on expertise, software organizations tend to build up difficulties. In this talk we discuss the causes for those difficulties and how a different responsibility model of "owners" and "enablers" address those difficulties. The model of "owners" and "enablers" is related to DevOps by the simple fact that for me - that's what DevOps is by denoting developers as owners and ops as enablers.
