Title: DevOps is Dead Long Live PanOps - Shahar Kedar

For quite a while now I've been trying to spread the idea that monitoring should be done top-down and not bottom-up. The idea in a nutshell is this: Stop measuring everything and trying to deduce overall system health from low-level metrics; instead start by defining your business KPIs and only then decide what you need to measure and what's the best way to measure that thing. This idea corresponds well with DevOps culture, since in most cases it would be up to your developers to instrument their applications to send the relevant metrics, thus breaking the dichotomy between dev and ops.

But recently I've realized that it's not enough to just involve the dev team. After all in most organizations it's not the dev team's job to define which KPIs are critical to the company's business, right? At the least - product managers should be involved, but at best it's a cross company effort involving sales, marketing, and even the CEO! So I concluded that "DevOps" is not enough. It doesn't capture the size of the effort that companies need to invest in order to do operations the right way. So - with some help from Miley Cyrus (yes, the pop star) - I decided to coin a new term: PanOps. In my lecture I intend to talk about what PanOps is, why I think it's important, and how it manifests itself in areas such as monitoring and automation.

had the chance to work closely with

00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:19,029
product managers account managers

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:24,789
project managers and other titles that

00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:26,650
are Aztec he's loved to hate and he's

00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:30,580
here to share with us his perspective on

00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,700
why closing this gap between R&D and

00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:46,090
business is essential part of DevOps so

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:49,720
please welcome chef oh okay hi everyone

00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:54,910
and then hello I thank you type for the

00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:59,140
introduction okay so I'm going to start

00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:01,180
with this really lousy low res diagram

00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,740
here which probably most of you can't

00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:09,460
read but it's important it was it first

00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,159
appeared in a post by Patrick Dubois six

00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,420
years ago it was only two months after

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:19,299
the first devil days conference in Ghent

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,969
and it tried to summarize all those

00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:25,719
important ideas that surfers during that

00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:28,060
conference I'm going to describe it real

00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:32,549
quick because it has very much it's very

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,549
relevant what I'm going to talk about so

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,049
okay so you can see roughly the three

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,350
main organizational units you have in

00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:47,020
n.e in every software company on the

00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:50,770
Left there's the business unit then

00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:54,460
there's the R&D unit here and last but

00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:56,799
not least the operations unit and this

00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,159
was a probably the structure of most

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,719
software companies at the time and when

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,670
they had the conference they try to

00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,950
think about how you can interconnect

00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:09,070
between all those units and use DevOps

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,170
concepts to make operations and in

00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,820
business much better and you can see

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,340
there's the central customer here of

00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,280
idea

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,260
is is all those good stuff that we

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,110
already most of us already know about

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,530
right so it's a closing the interaction

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,420
between devs and ops it's about doing

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,970
deployments continued delivery using

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,000
configuration management tools it's

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:36,140
about infrastructure is code we've all

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,790
heard about it more than once in all the

00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:42,110
conferences and most articles about

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:46,910
DevOps and what I think is missing from

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:50,690
from the discourse those satellite ideas

00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:54,620
here down down here and in here on the

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,890
top those ideas that connect between the

00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,410
business and D and the Ops teams and

00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:02,540
just for example business should focus

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:06,019
on both functional and non-functional

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,360
requirements things like operation teams

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,390
should organize themselves according to

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,319
business goals those are the kind of

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:17,780
ideas that I rarely see in in those

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,459
conferences or in any article and I

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,019
think I'm very important I'm going to

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:26,209
talk about them today okay so a bit of

00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:28,790
history so DevOps is really an extension

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,060
of agile right the primary goal was to

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,370
build software faster and better when I

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,739
mean faster I mean shorter release

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,260
cycles faster feedback from production

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:44,299
from customers and when I say better i

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:47,590
mean you know with this you know keeping

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:50,840
a high quality standard in the face of

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,690
rapid delivery and deployment and

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,299
development and those those were the

00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,829
ideas behind agile and DevOps was an

00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:03,079
extension of that and I'm going to show

00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:05,510
it in a few slides so the first slide is

00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:09,019
is the typical organizational structure

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:11,599
like I know six seven eight years ago

00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:14,540
hopefully no one here and in the

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,049
audience is still using this methodology

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,820
which is gold waterfall right so you

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,349
have business you know you have

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,090
requirements coming from the business to

00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,990
the product the product creates all

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,539
those

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,460
our heavy description though of what

00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:31,039
they want to build and then they give it

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,690
to the depth the dev team to implement

00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:40,220
the dev team give that to QA to test QA

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:42,740
signs approved the solution and give it

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,319
to the obstacle who all they do is

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:49,190
deploy in monett all right so this is

00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:51,349
old-school and an angel came in and made

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,470
a small step at a very significant one

00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:56,569
saying let's take product dev and QA and

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,550
make them collaborate much better with

00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:02,080
each other right so if you look at

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:05,210
methodologies like scrum you have

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,860
cross-functional teams people from the

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:15,050
different divisions working together and

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:19,400
and rapid release cycles and and and all

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:24,289
that nice stuff but still the ops team

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,990
is out of the loop right next in line

00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:29,780
came the lien which was again in another

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,479
extension of agile the lean style which

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,250
said okay that that's nice to have those

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,810
guys collaborate together but we really

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,599
need to get feedback all the time from

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:42,080
production from our customers and they

00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:45,770
said and then you know release cycles

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,560
became even shorter they we try to find

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,400
different ways to make it to deploy

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:56,330
faster to production and it's only and

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,810
when DevOps came they said hey we can

00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:02,240
make and okay that that's a awkward

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,099
because when I when I did it at home it

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,110
was on my computer and I wanted to like

00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:09,590
show you how it shortens the release

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,479
cycle can't really do to do it here but

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,719
I think it's pretty evident what DevOps

00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:18,500
did or say hey let's make it much

00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:23,360
shorter by enhancing collaboration

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,789
between Devon ops and now deployment you

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,349
know most of us are I hope that many

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:32,599
companies do continue delivery they use

00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:34,409
configuration management to rapidly

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:36,319
deploy to production

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:41,459
and we get feedback much much quicker

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:45,929
and it's not surprising that you know

00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:47,969
DevOps was mainly focused around how to

00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:51,179
make dev and ops club or it better right

00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:54,929
because they have ops right it's in the

00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:57,599
name but it's not only that it comes

00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:59,909
from the roots of DevOps so this isn't

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,809
an analysis by John Willis talking about

00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:06,149
the ancestors of DevOps and he said

00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:08,550
things like and you know you have

00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:11,119
Patrick Dubois and Andrew Schaefer who

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:15,059
created the age of infrastructure team

00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:18,449
forum which was actually sis admins who

00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:22,079
knew how to code and they say hey we can

00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:25,079
really ship we can ship code faster if

00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,719
we start the code stuff and if we use

00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:31,589
our skills better and at the same time

00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:35,879
in velocity it was I think John I'll all

00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:39,179
spa who who came and gave a lecture

00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:42,779
about how flickr deploys more than 10

00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:44,909
times a day and as you can see both both

00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:49,889
of those roots are people who came from

00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:53,249
the operation units and it was easy for

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:55,619
them i guess to just trying to close the

00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:58,829
gap between Devon off because those are

00:07:55,619 --> 00:08:01,019
the kind of of people the kind of people

00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:07,050
they used to work with on daily basis

00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:10,469
and so that's why I think that most

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,199
people DevOps means how to make

00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:16,699
developers and IT professionals walk is

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,959
a single unit and it's okay it's not

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:24,899
that it's not a bad concept but it's

00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,759
simply not enough for me dev off means a

00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,139
set of ideas that have software

00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,079
companies improved the way the business

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:34,680
operates and it's much more than just

00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:40,110
blurring the distinction between Devon

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:42,269
ops because in the end it's your product

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,540
units you know product management and

00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:47,360
sales who decide whether the business is

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,060
successful or not

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,120
it's not the off steam it's not the R&D

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:57,019
team those guys across the street across

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,560
the hall and we when we have miss

00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:03,019
communications between business and R&D

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,700
we creating inefficiencies okay we

00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:07,550
deliver stuff that we don't really need

00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:10,040
to deliver we monitor stuff that we

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:14,329
don't really need to monitor we get

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:19,700
feedback about the wrong things and it's

00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:25,070
inefficient so so I think that what's

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:26,930
happening is that we actively discussing

00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,180
how we can make collaboration better

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,360
this happens all the time right I think

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,519
I think at the keynote yesterday he had

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,810
this diagram on the left right how we

00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:42,079
can try what's the right apology of the

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:45,110
organization to make Devon and ass work

00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:48,290
together better and and we get that all

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:52,149
the time but we rarely discuss how we

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:55,730
can make up and product in sales

00:09:52,149 --> 00:10:00,560
collaborate around business goals and

00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:04,190
that's bad and I'm going to show just

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,500
you know I'm going to take two areas in

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:09,500
operations and give some use cases and

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:12,740
some examples of how I think I think

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:15,320
things should be I think she could be

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:20,540
better if we try to collaborate so the

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:23,269
first array is monitoring in in the

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,399
previous lecture here twas run I don't

00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:28,760
know if he's in the audience it was run

00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:32,570
who said morning talking's not only for

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:35,540
Ops teams and and he continued and said

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,160
you should enable your developers to to

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,440
be able to you know set up their own

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,260
money tolling in the in-center metrics

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,990
and whatnot and and that's that's

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,680
correct but monitoring is not only for

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,300
dev of things it's it's it's for

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,170
everyone in the company and I'm going to

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,720
show why so if you look today on all the

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,089
monitoring solution that we have this is

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,800
a poster that big time I create it's

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,570
actually a website you can go in

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,330
it's open source you can add your own

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,790
monitoring solution if you have one this

00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,740
is a poster where you have only 60

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:13,100
solutions that you can pick off the

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:15,769
shelf or clone from gate open stores

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:19,550
whatever that you can use to monitor

00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:24,410
your system right the over 60 only here

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:27,920
in the over 100 probably out there and I

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:30,769
think that the fact that there's so many

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,110
solutions that you just want to monitor

00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:35,300
all the things right let's just you know

00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,899
send everything let's let's mind our

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:42,649
applications and servers and network

00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:47,000
let's send you know thousands of metrics

00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:50,390
a minute to all key value to all the

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,140
time series data bases and I think that

00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,490
that created this approach from on

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,190
towing which I call the bottom-up

00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,320
approach well if start by monitoring

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,170
network and servers and applications and

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,980
you try to deduce from those metric

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:09,079
what's the overall system health the

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,950
problem with that or just one of them I

00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:15,980
think what the maybe that the most

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:18,800
painful one is a large fatigue right

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,390
because and is there anyone here in the

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:27,020
crowd who doesn't have a large fatigue

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:30,260
raise your hand okay uuuugh come work

00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:35,180
for me I want to know your magic okay so

00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:36,770
it's a large fatigue so it's worth

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,579
fatiguing why do we have a large fatigue

00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:44,540
because we take tools off the shelf we

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:47,660
install them we set up and they choose

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,029
for us what to measure right you put you

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,550
install new relic it instruments into

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:56,050
your application and start sending like

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:58,579
pens of metrics out of the box Wow cool

00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,589
and then you can create alerts on top of

00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:04,160
that and that yeah and you do that right

00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:05,899
because you can and the same goes for

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,020
every other solution set new relic

00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:11,149
specifically so but what happens is they

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,590
choose what to measure it's not a

00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:16,290
conscious choice that we do

00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:19,770
so that's the first problem and and

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:22,050
because they choose is we get fatigued

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:27,290
by the wrong information right not

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:31,950
actionable not actionable alerts I know

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:35,550
cpu load kind of things that we all know

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:37,140
and hate and I'm just trying to

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,990
understand what are we trying to do

00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:42,150
again so I think what you're trying to

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,210
do is transfer this simple question is

00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,430
our system in a healthy state right

00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:50,610
that's the main question it's not about

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,860
how much CPU we take in this specific

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,720
server or what's the LPM of our

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,420
application its whether the system is

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,980
healthy or not and for me and a healthy

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,460
system is a system that continuously

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:06,570
generates value for its users under a

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:13,500
well-known state of KPIs okay values and

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:17,460
kpi's there's no solution out there that

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,130
can magically know what what is your

00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,230
KPIs there's no solution out there that

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:26,040
can magically know what kind of value

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:27,780
your application generates its it's not

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:33,630
there okay you're looking at the wrong

00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:36,690
places and what I suggest is to reverse

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,940
the way we think we need to do top-down

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,250
approach we need to start by thinking

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,650
about the KPIs when you start by

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,600
thinking about user experience and we

00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,310
need to understand how those affect the

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,620
overall system health and not the other

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:54,230
way around and if you accept this

00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,160
approach if you if you agree with this

00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:01,250
approach then I have a question for you

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,530
who in your organization defines kpi's

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:12,960
is there anyone here in the crowd who

00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:18,090
defined KPI for his system maybe 12 was

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:22,770
it a business KPI yeah what what's your

00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:24,819
job Pollock manager thank you the only

00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:29,439
one in the crowd here

00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:34,539
its product who decide what generates

00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:39,100
value right it's not R&D it's not

00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:42,249
operations its product to decide if your

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:45,579
business is around for example real-time

00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:49,419
analytics and it takes one day to become

00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:52,660
you know those shiny analytics to get to

00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:55,359
become available for the customer you're

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,850
not giving value and the only one who

00:15:55,359 --> 00:16:01,569
can tell you hey we need to have a

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:07,179
latency of less than X Y Z is its

00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:10,299
product its sales and we rarely talk

00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:14,679
about sales right that decides what

00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:17,410
generates revenue guys will be building

00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:21,729
a business here it needs to generate

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,319
money ok so and they decide what

00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:30,549
generates revenue they know what

00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:32,259
generates revenue not R&D and its

00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:36,309
marketing we decide for generates

00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:42,600
traction right many many startups they

00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:47,489
work around attraction I think that ah

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:50,259
facebook yeah right that huge unicorn

00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:53,979
they didn't do a scent before the eye

00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:57,179
before the IPO okay so it was about

00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:59,619
traction and it's probably marketing

00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:06,220
that tells you what generates fraction

00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:08,319
whatnot so again when you think about

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,509
more annoying you need to ask yourself

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,579
are you talking to those guys in your

00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:15,279
organization or not and if you're not

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:18,699
talking to them then something is really

00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,439
wrong about how you're walking today I'm

00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:24,519
going to give a simple example of how

00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:28,169
good KPI can do miracles and I'm going

00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,169
to take the example of netflix and

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,889
netflix released an article about you

00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:38,200
know the beginning of the year about

00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:40,899
their search for a single KPI

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,289
that would really predict if there's a

00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:46,440
problem with their main business and

00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:48,190
Netflix main business is viewing right

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,470
that's what you do when you go on

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:53,500
netflix you give you stuff you view your

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:57,190
favorite serious and whatnot or a good

00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:04,179
movie and they discovered that if they

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:06,370
start monitoring the amount of tyvek the

00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:08,649
time number of times that people click

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:11,010
on the play button it doesn't read it

00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:16,809
doesn't really matter on which device

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:20,529
they can they can graph it and they have

00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:25,710
a very regular pattern on how people

00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:30,240
play and it looks something like this ok

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:37,029
this is SPS ok so it's very regular and

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:39,360
if something goes wrong with SPS then

00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:45,070
something is really wrong with Netflix

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:49,120
ok that's why it netflix they have the

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:52,720
concept of SPS impacting or non

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:55,779
impacting an incident knowledge that's

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,519
not as fierce impacting is less

00:18:55,779 --> 00:19:00,549
important than that's facing infecting

00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,500
by an order of magnitude and it's

00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:06,100
amazing look at the graph it's so simple

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:10,120
the collecting one metric they graph it

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,980
they monitor it they do awesome job and

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,769
mountain gate and finding anomalies and

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,019
I'm not trying to say it's that simple

00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:22,440
but but everyone can understand this

00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:26,049
right so for example this is how an

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,130
unhealthy as face pattern look likes we

00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:30,309
all understand what's going on here

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:33,039
right some point number of place goes

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:36,070
down below the expected threshold the

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,710
expected pattern that's easy to

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:42,370
understand and this is I think what

00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:44,860
makes SPS no special right you have one

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,809
metric it predicts everything in your

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:51,760
system it predicts whether your system

00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:54,910
is generating value or not it's very

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,550
kpi about user experience and it's easy

00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:02,850
to understand that cause all the company

00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:06,220
whether its product sales your CEO

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:11,650
marketing whoever obviously lnd not

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:15,310
everyone can't stand it it's amazing so

00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:17,440
the question is and I'd like to argue

00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,830
that the only way you can get those KPIs

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,340
and the only way you can reach that

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:27,820
level of quality is if you start

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:32,230
communicating with those guys that know

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:36,280
what those KPIs are so that's the first

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:39,820
example now I'm going to talk about

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:45,340
different area which is capacity

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:48,250
planning right who doesn't do capacity

00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:52,210
play who does capacity planning for his

00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:56,620
system okay right yeah many people write

00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:59,560
most of us here we also do try to do

00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,900
capacity planning in big panda and what

00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,110
what I'm going to tell you right now is

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:08,080
the true story of feature that we

00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:10,150
released recently so i'm going to give a

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,800
few words about big panda so big fan de

00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:16,390
is uh we're a SAS solution we aggregate

00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,250
alerts coming from different monitoring

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,070
system and we do smart correlation

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,650
around those alerts more importantly

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,720
we're multi-tenant we're deployed on the

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,290
cloud and it's going to be important for

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,360
the next example because once we develop

00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,850
a feature and we deliver it it goes to

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,660
all our customers ok so we if we open it

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:41,020
if we remove the future toggle it goes

00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,020
to everyone and we recently developed a

00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:47,140
new feature called big panda analytics

00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,910
ok it lets you gain gain insight into

00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,820
your hilarious data so you can see which

00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,010
alerts are more noisy than relative to

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,010
other alerts for example just for

00:21:54,010 --> 00:22:00,730
example and I thought until recently it

00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:03,430
was in beta so we feature toggled it we

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,370
enabled it only for selected the set of

00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,059
customers

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:11,809
and and we got feedback and and and it

00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:14,780
was very cool very cool and last but and

00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:16,670
it's important for the next slide it's

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,590
built on top of an of elastic search I

00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:22,490
guess that most of you are familiar with

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:25,309
the with that solution okay so what

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,350
happened two months ago two months ago I

00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:30,680
have this conversation with marketing

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:33,470
product they're saying hey we want to do

00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:37,550
PR for analytics around the end of

00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:41,270
September just you know a week ago and I

00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:44,500
said okay makes sense but we need to run

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:49,790
some tests first let's talk about kpi's

00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:51,620
and two good things happen here the

00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:57,050
first one which Malik might sound

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:59,360
trivial but it's not marketing actually

00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:02,870
came to us and said hey we're going to

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:06,080
do PR about the feature in two months

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:08,540
from now which means we need to g8 right

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,400
has to be available to everyone that's

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:15,620
the first thing good thing that happened

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,450
here the second one was that when we

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,750
came to product and said hey we need

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,880
kpi's they did two things they said okay

00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:26,570
let's prioritize it higher and let you

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,750
work on understanding whether we can we

00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:35,120
can GA that stuff and more importantly

00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:39,170
they give us a KPI Wow magical yes there

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,770
was a KPI we had to be able to do

00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:45,500
queries in a very short time for a

00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:49,190
number of concurrent users or different

00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:53,480
organizations of course so that was the

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:58,220
good thing that happened the bad thing

00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:01,820
that happened is that we did our tests

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:06,200
we ran our tests and correlating see was

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:08,960
okay but we had a bit of a problem so

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,750
apparently a high number of shards in

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,470
lastik search per node compromises

00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:17,510
health a cluster health so just a few

00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:20,360
words about elasticsearch sharding

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,280
classic search means a way of fitting

00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:26,840
the data across different nodes in the

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:31,370
cluster okay so depending on your index

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:34,640
model and in your object model the

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:41,630
number of charts could vary in our case

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:46,100
it was very very high and something bad

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:50,600
happened here okay this was supposed to

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:54,230
be a slide of missing what okay that

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,990
there ignore that so you know when I

00:24:54,230 --> 00:25:00,680
heard about this problem that the high

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:02,900
high number of shards I said okay I mean

00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,270
it's stuff but we'll do we'll find a way

00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:08,540
to solve that and there were many

00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,700
possible solution to that problem one

00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,740
solution was to say okay let's gradually

00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:17,330
add customers instead of enabled

00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:21,200
enabling it to all customers and and the

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:26,060
problem was that once you do a PR you

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:29,900
can't let people sign up and not see the

00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:31,760
feature right so you at least all those

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,700
people who sign up should see the new

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:39,080
feature and more than that the sales

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:41,360
organization came in told us listen we

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:50,510
also need to enable it to around 200

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:56,510
customers yeah we can't do 200 customers

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:58,250
at this point so so that wasn't really

00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:01,520
an option we couldn't really on board

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,980
them gradually and so we went to other

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,600
solution so okay let's add more notes to

00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,350
elasticsearch right more nodes in

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,870
elastic search let's charge filter note

00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:15,560
sounds easy but we're just you know

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:19,990
we'll start up no it's more nodes cost

00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:23,240
money they cause complex complexity and

00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:26,990
at this point it just really didn't make

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,240
sense to add more nodes so we said okay

00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,860
let's change our index configuration to

00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:36,200
create less charts

00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:37,790
again very legitimate but we had a

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,210
problem with that that it would affect a

00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:43,640
sleigh for example we could say no one

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,590
has replication there's no data

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,320
application in the elastic search number

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,210
of shards goes down by the number of

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,880
record you know divided by the number of

00:26:50,210 --> 00:27:00,230
replicas he wanted in the first place so

00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:03,679
we we affect SLA and so the problem was

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:07,250
that there was no straight for technical

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,780
solution we could use we had there was

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,910
no other way other than communicating

00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:14,299
all the issues that all stakeholders

00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:17,299
have and working with clean numbers in

00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:19,340
SLA mine and agreeing on what other

00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:22,429
business calls and technical limitations

00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:25,400
to solve this problem there was no other

00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:27,740
way other than collaborating with each

00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:32,600
other and collaborating with product and

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:36,230
sales eventually the solution was to

00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:39,200
create two tiers of SLA according to the

00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:42,770
customers plan so if you're a paying

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,950
customer you get replication and better

00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:47,660
performance by getting more shards if

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:50,390
you're not paying not a paying customer

00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:53,530
you on a trial then you don't get any

00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:56,750
replication and you get only one chart

00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:59,000
that's okay you're probably going to be

00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,190
in the system for 21 days 30 days

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,480
depending on the trial you're not paying

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:06,950
us so that's a legitimate solution and

00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:11,150
the only way we could get to that

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:14,030
solution was to have sales agree that

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,880
this is what they are selling right they

00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:19,700
are not selling for when they go to

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,910
customers and they say okay now bye-bye

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,500
our product and they ask them what do we

00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:31,510
get this is what they're selling is

00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:35,120
selling reliability and performance and

00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:37,490
so everyone is very happy because

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,360
product marketing got their feature

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:43,780
launched on time sales didn't have to

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,780
lose any opportunities

00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:52,120
and for us it meant no midnight pager

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:56,710
duties so everyone was happy and again

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,710
because only because we cooperated so

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:09,020
when when i called this presentation

00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:10,790
DevOps is dead long leap an ops what i

00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:14,180
was trying to say it's not only about

00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:16,310
Devon ops we need to try things

00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:20,330
differently on how we do stuff in our

00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:23,150
organization it's about everyone okay

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:27,170
it's about product it's about marketing

00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:28,640
I your CEO should bout tablets um you

00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:35,810
know what certain points should be

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:42,020
involved it's about everyone so this is

00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:44,870
me giving you a wake-up call if you are

00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:48,110
a product guy you need to provide

00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:50,210
non-functional requirements you need to

00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:57,200
translate business value into clear

00:29:50,210 --> 00:30:00,580
kpi's that's part of your job okay if

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,590
your sales guy is their sales guy here

00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:06,110
okay forget about it no no I'm kidding

00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,790
I'm kidding it first know if you're if

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:10,160
you're working with cells guys go to

00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:12,620
them so if your sales guy you need to

00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:16,840
understand that they're only they're not

00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:20,830
only selling features does selling

00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:25,390
reliability they're selling security

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:29,270
they're selling disaster recovery right

00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:33,220
and they need to align the business

00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:37,100
calls with the operational constraints

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:40,520
how many you know how many companies

00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:48,710
your how many startups sell five nines

00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:52,240
to their customers five nines you do you

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:55,990
sell it exactly it's in the contract

00:30:52,240 --> 00:31:02,509
okay you're also your sell it the

00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:05,210
but can you give five nines okay you

00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:08,149
can't give five nines if there's someone

00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,610
here who can give five nines I want to

00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:13,129
hear about it I don't believe you how

00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:20,080
much is five nines if you take it to a

00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:24,740
week five minutes a year of downtime

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,409
yeah facebook had more than five minutes

00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:30,919
I think like two weeks ago right Google

00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:35,059
had more than five minutes at various

00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:41,119
points no one is giving five nines and

00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:48,860
yet sales sell it and they don't really

00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:50,960
need to we're not selling 59 and if

00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:54,730
you're in the dev or ops team or

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,279
whatever you call it you need to drive

00:31:54,730 --> 00:32:00,499
collaboration not only internally you

00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:03,440
need to insist on working with business

00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:05,929
goals it's also your responsibility okay

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,139
don't expect you see there's there's

00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:11,029
only one product guide in the house

00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:13,159
there's no one from sales here don't

00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,899
expect them to understand that they need

00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:16,610
to work to give your business goals to

00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:20,600
give you kpi's it's your responsibility

00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:25,260
to go to them and ask for it and if

00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:28,290
you're a kick-ass engineer we're hiring

00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:40,360
so you're welcome to come to me

00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:52,330
afterwards and we'll talk accessor

00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:55,150
questions questions questions no one so

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:58,570
one question about the reason for using

00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:00,280
elasticsearch do you provide I don't you

00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,600
know the analytical question in advance

00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,040
so you could do it at night you know

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,720
MapReduce something like that then you

00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,510
can scale more easily yeah other than

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,140
you to add more cpus yeah so we had to

00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:13,860
choose between when we started building

00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:17,320
the platform we had to choose between

00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,230
being very restrict about very limited

00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:23,790
to the count of use cases we can answer

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:26,050
and between being very flexible right if

00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:27,460
because it was in beta one of the

00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,110
purposes was to get feedback from the

00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,540
customers what kind of reports they

00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:34,540
expect and to be able to iterate fast

00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:36,520
over that too to see if we could give

00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:39,010
them something valuable and that's why

00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,440
we didn't go for the free calculated

00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:44,290
reports but rather let's put it all in a

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,590
silo and then build aggregation of on

00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:50,740
top of that but I agree that performance

00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:55,300
wise it was if you know your use case

00:33:50,740 --> 00:34:05,680
this is not better point yeah finally

00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:10,180
someone not from the front line so you

00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:11,980
gave a lot of examples about kpi's for

00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:14,440
production environments in online

00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:18,130
environments I was wondering if you do

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:21,420
kpi monitoring or KPI based monitoring

00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:24,670
for development environments or

00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:29,080
environments that the KPI in front of

00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:31,240
the end user is not so easily defined or

00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,030
yeah I'm not sure I understand that the

00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:37,350
class section then then answer the first

00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,950
one do you okay I do do you do kpi's for

00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,129
development environment

00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:46,349
or staging and not customer-facing

00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:46,349
necessarily we don't but why should we

00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,139
know my money doesn't come from

00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:55,419
development or staging comes from

00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:57,400
production yeah so we measure our KPIs

00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:59,950
and for example we have staging

00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:04,300
environments well we measure our KPIs

00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:06,940
and see if we can you know if by doing

00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,490
certain changes we can give a better KPI

00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,770
but eventually what happens in

00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:14,109
production is the real number right you

00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:17,230
can read there's a really good blog post

00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:20,920
we actually invested like two months at

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:25,660
creating we use ansible in-house to

00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,190
deploy all our data center we can we can

00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:30,040
just you know create a new data center

00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:34,690
in 20 minutes in a different region in

00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:36,450
AWS it's easy it's one click and and we

00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:40,869
invested two months in creating a

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:43,660
performance testing environment in

00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:46,450
another region to see if we can scale

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:49,390
out to to actually know handle all those

00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:52,060
KPIs all those future KPIs that we're

00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:54,310
going to give and you know it was great

00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:58,420
experience we did we wrote a similar

00:35:54,310 --> 00:36:01,810
tale we measured everything it was a

00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:06,250
kick-ass experience but you know it's

00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:08,619
never going to be like production you're

00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:11,400
never going to simulate production as

00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:13,720
well as productions in its production

00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:19,480
there's no way it's going to happen and

00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:21,819
worse than that if you if you're only

00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,010
going to measure you know those

00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:25,810
performance of staging environments and

00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:28,240
not going to migrate everything you do

00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:31,930
to production you're just you know

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,760
kidding yourself so I you can measure in

00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,109
that you can measure in staging but you

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,619
need to measure in production you need

00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:40,619
to work with that and what maybe yeah

00:36:47,430 --> 00:37:00,730
do you find a way to kc i like measuring

00:36:53,470 --> 00:37:03,220
in customer-facing internal

00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:11,230
infrastructure systems that you still

00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:13,630
did our production but yeah okay did any

00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,970
more did everyone hear the question okay

00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:18,609
so we asked whether we measure what do

00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,710
we use KPI is not only for customer

00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:24,010
facing application right but also for

00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:26,200
internal applications so i'm not sure if

00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:28,210
you flying to internal application

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,530
things that are used only by the island

00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:34,990
d team or in general so yeah we have it

00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,750
you know for example we have our data

00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:39,310
pipeline which is completely internal

00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:42,700
it's not customer-facing but it does

00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:44,290
affect the user experience of customers

00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,820
and yeah we actually started by

00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:49,480
measuring that because that's more

00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:55,660
important than whether the font ended

00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:58,089
it's not more important as well come I'm

00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,190
sorry to cut you up guys but we I really

00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:02,380
want to give another another question

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,750
and we just going to go to lunch so I

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:09,130
encourage you to continue that after

00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:11,200
sorry hurry something you said that

00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:14,320
resonated was the idea that you're not

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,330
selling five nines I however in my case

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,040
for example a customer's we'll ask our

00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:20,619
salespeople will do you offer five nines

00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,589
and their response is absolutely we

00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:25,210
offer five nines and I say I'm problem

00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:27,790
and they say never speak to a customer

00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,230
ever again thanks so this ties back to

00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,270
the keynote this morning but how do you

00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,160
effectively negotiate and communicate

00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,119
that with salespeople to a point where

00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:40,240
they don't just cut you out of the

00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:45,040
process okay so I I agree i'm lucky okay

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:49,570
i have the products the lv v product

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,810
when he came in like six months ago I

00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:55,550
think it was

00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:57,980
for the right he asked me how fast can

00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:01,640
we go back for example for when there's

00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:04,840
disaster okay Oh what kind of how what's

00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:08,300
our availability and I told him okay

00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:12,800
this and that and it's not five nines

00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:16,030
and and and they said okay let me see

00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:19,780
let me talk with sales and we saw that

00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:24,620
we experimented right went to customers

00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:28,370
big customers and told them we're not

00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:30,920
going to give you five nines we're going

00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:32,570
to try to give you I'm not going to say

00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,170
our SLA here but we're going to try to

00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:41,540
give you something something something

00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:44,690
but but we commit to that okay and we're

00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:49,520
going to refund you if we're not going

00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:51,850
to AH to deliver that kind of quality in

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,350
their work yeah okay I'm okay with that

00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:58,160
and you know i'm not sure if it will

00:39:54,350 --> 00:40:00,980
hold for next year when we get much

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,310
bigger but at that point we won't be

00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,050
startup anymore will be I hope the

00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:08,930
engineering team will be much bigger and

00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:11,380
we might be able to sell more than what

00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,380
we sell today

00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,450
