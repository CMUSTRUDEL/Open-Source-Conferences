Whenever people come together, communications starts at once! You can't stop it! Due to our modern times, additional to the original face-to-face communication we use a lot of different communication channels like phones, chats, live webinars and emails.

As communication is a very complex topic misunderstandings are part of daily our work. We have to spend a lot of time to deal with these misunderstandings or - what is worse - things will go wrong.

The more different characters work together in cross-functional teams like DevOps the higher the probability of misunderstandings. With release cycles getting shorter and shorter or continuous delivery, time is a very precious factor in IT projects. So why do we waste time in clearing up misunderstandings? For more efficiency it will be extremely helpful to identify the bugs in your communication and eliminate them to reduce misunderstandings and save time!

In this session theoretical background will be combined with best practice; the importance of further education in communication skills especially for "people from IT" to reach more efficiency will be pointed out.

About the speaker - Sabine Bernecker-Bendixen

Sabine is coaching people, moderating workshops, leading projects with more than 100 people and teaching adults of different professions in communication skills, soft skills and leadership skills for more than 20 years. For more than 13 years she works as a freelance consultant.

She helps new teams to grow together and leaders to find their own people centered way of bringing out the best of their teams. With her support teams develop their own team culture.

The key statements of her work are: "Focus on the human part!"" and "Think outside the box!" To work on and manage agile projects or DevOps teams means a lot more than technical tools and putting different people together especially in soft skills. According to her, leadership is not only a management technique - it is a way of thinking and believe, a way of behavior and living! She assists leaders, teams and companies to create and implement their own agile, human focused culture and helps them to reflect their situations.

As a speaker she attracted a lot of interest at DevOpsDays Paris and Ljubljana 2015. She will speak at DevOpsDays Amsterdam and BASTA!. Additionally she writes articles for the German Entwickler Magazin. Her posts are also published on devops.com.

thank you very much good morning them up

00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:04,909
folks the topic chosen is debugging your

00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:13,849
communication for more efficiency that's

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:15,290
me at work and work could be different

00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:17,540
all the time you think you know

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,910
everything and the next day will show

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,950
you you don't know anything you have to

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:27,170
start to learn new and that's what I

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:30,650
have done the last two years when I

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:34,459
start dealing with the people from the

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:37,959
tech industry I had to learn what you

00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:43,120
are talking about how you are organized

00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:47,510
try to understand how you are thinking

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,459
you all are human beings but sometimes I

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:53,180
have the impression that you think you

00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,769
are something totally different and so I

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,230
had to learn a lot and I'm still

00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:59,150
learning and it's much fun and yesterday

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,340
we heard that we have to learn our whole

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,930
life and I think that's very important

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:09,380
for us to learn our whole life

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:13,299
communication is important important for

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:16,910
the tech industry important for DevOps

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:21,950
yesterday we heard that DevOps is not

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:24,650
about culture hmm I do agree when we

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:27,230
define culture as after work culture

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,150
going out to have some beer some drinks

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,870
that's a nice thing but that's not

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:36,170
culture culture for me always appears

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:39,410
then when things get worse when we are

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,319
not in our comfort zone when we have to

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,959
leave the beloved things we do we are

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,739
doing every day and we get into stress

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,860
in situation then culture is for me how

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:54,440
we behave with each other how we

00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,470
communicate with each other and I think

00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,330
for DevOps for working

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:05,440
in cross-functional teams for working in

00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:08,870
multicultural for working in diversity

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,410
culture is important when you define

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:17,000
culture as the way we behave with each

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:21,400
other in difficult situations and for

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,690
culture for behaving with each other

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:32,930
communication is the system you

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:37,190
transport your ideas you transport what

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:40,270
you want to say you transport a part of

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,130
your behavior so communication is

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,620
important for culture communication is

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,610
important for work communication is

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:53,780
important wherever people come together

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:59,780
to give their best and to come to goals

00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:02,360
to reach goals there's one guy called

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:06,080
Paul wats lovak he once said we cannot

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,240
not communicate whenever we get together

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,570
with another person we start

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,479
communicating at once even when we are

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:19,520
saying nothing because communication is

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:22,130
far more than the spoken word and when I

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,910
was standing here and were saying

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:30,169
nothing you would get an impression of

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:33,380
my person and so this is a kind of

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:36,760
communication communication is

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,530
everywhere around us all the time and

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,180
the bad thing is that misunderstanding

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,150
is often is hot on the heels of

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,030
communication misunderstanding is part

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:54,050
of communication that's the thing we

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:58,370
have to face a bad communication causes

00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:01,490
maybe a lot of trouble a bad

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:06,110
communication often is the reason for

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:07,660
mistakes a bad community in

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,360
communication could really be

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:15,090
demotivating

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:18,449
and a bad communication could cost lust

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:22,500
of energy to clear up all those

00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:28,110
misunderstandings afterwards a bad

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:31,379
communication costs a lot of time and it

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:34,740
costs efficiency it specs for efficiency

00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:38,250
and in the end a bad communication could

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:42,810
be very expensive I think all those

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:48,240
points are similar to IT projects aren't

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:49,949
a lot of IT projects cause of trouble

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,219
are reasons for mistakes are

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:56,870
demotivating costs a lot of energy costs

00:06:53,219 --> 00:07:02,849
a lot of time aren't very efficient and

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:05,279
are perhaps expensive perhaps the way

00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:08,969
the team is communicating with each

00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:18,599
other it's one of the reasons why IT

00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:22,259
projects sometimes run this way so why

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:25,710
do we accept this why do we accept that

00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:30,930
a bad communication disturbs our

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:36,270
motivation disturbs our projects I don't

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:39,000
know or it is that we underestimate the

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:44,699
complexity and the importance of

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:51,330
communication because most of us things

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:53,310
we are masters of communication because

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:57,659
we are communicating from our early

00:07:53,310 --> 00:08:02,659
childhood on we are able to speak and

00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:13,139
write we are able to listen and read so

00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:20,069
why the hell do we need do we need to

00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:23,000
learn how to communicate I think we are

00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:27,060
sometimes more like masters of disasters

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,180
we know that our communication isn't

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:33,780
good enough but we don't start doing

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,780
anything about it which keeps on talking

00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,180
we have to communicate we have to better

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:49,560
our communication but what do you do to

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:51,690
for that tell me too often we are

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,360
trapped in the complex web of the

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:58,500
communication it's called our own

00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:02,730
patterns and that's the reason why it is

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:06,560
so hard to better our communication we

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:11,460
talk about our patterns we have learned

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:15,210
all over the time and to leave this

00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:19,860
well-known passes is hard especially

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:28,220
when you try it on your own so what can

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:33,770
we do first of all we have to change our

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:39,750
mindset concerning communication

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:43,050
communication is important even for

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:46,410
people from tech we need to learn a lot

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:50,220
about communication there are some

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:54,300
natural born talents and communication

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:57,000
but only a son some of you we need to

00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,870
ask for help to better our communication

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,700
when I don't ask anyone how do you feel

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,190
do you feel about the way I'm

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:09,500
communicating with you I don't know

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,780
what's going on in his mind or her mind

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:19,680
we need to stop concentrating only on

00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:21,360
technical skills and we need to start

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,860
our training for communication

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:30,050
communication has to be trained in a

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:33,900
team or as a symbol single person so I

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,750
hear some guys to decide about money for

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:42,260
further education

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:44,630
oh no one if you ask in the company they

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,410
were always say yeah it's okay go to a

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:51,410
well to a seminar with programming

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:54,260
languages or whatever but when you ask I

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:59,210
want to visit a communication semi nicer

00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:01,070
hmm what's benefit out of it no one

00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:08,020
wants to spend money on this topic

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:08,020
although it's very very important so

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:18,260
that's what we all know the very simple

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:20,840
model of sender receiver the message in

00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:24,500
between and there is action of the

00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,720
receiver but when I say communication is

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:34,520
a very complex topic this couldn't be

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:36,590
our it's not enough let's look in our

00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:41,030
let's have a look in our history the

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:47,839
oldest parts of communication 4.5

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:52,370
billion years old the human being is 4.5

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:56,020
million years old and the modern human

00:11:52,370 --> 00:12:00,670
being as we are only 40,000 years old

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:04,510
that means the oldest parts of

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:07,280
communication a much older than we are

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:10,820
not me as a person but we as a human

00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:14,300
being kind so there are some systems

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:18,470
inside of us which are very very very

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:23,900
old but we don't know about them most of

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:28,640
us and just for your information this

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:32,500
young guy sings hoops 98.5 percent is

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:38,150
anyone an idea what we are talking about

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:40,570
the jeans yes 98.5 percent of our genes

00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:44,240
are similar to those of the chimpanzees

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:47,250
the number depends on the method of

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,990
analyzation but

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:54,480
average number just for your information

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:56,460
the genes of the male are more similar

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,490
to those of the chimpanzees than those

00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,310
of the women so you can make up your

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:04,560
mind for yourself just for the

00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:07,770
information we say we are the human

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,980
being and we are the Queen's and the

00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:15,240
kings of the of the earth but we are not

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:22,010
far away from those guys yeah and they

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:25,680
are communicating to and hmm try it

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:29,880
there's movie from the BBC about

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:33,870
chimpanzees colony and when you turn off

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,350
the volume and just have a look at this

00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,850
guy's acting with each other and

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,900
thinking the way all those hairs on the

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:45,360
body and put them into some closes I

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:54,570
think you find some parallels in acting

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:57,330
with each other so far about you one why

00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:02,089
is communication so complex and what is

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:04,650
part of it all these components are

00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:07,560
communication we have here the part of

00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:10,860
the verbal communication until here the

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:14,070
part of the nonverbal communication the

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:18,020
verbal communication it's all about the

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:21,510
wordings the syntax the logic grammar

00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:25,400
the spoken word the meaning of the

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:29,010
spoken word or even other written word

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:33,780
that's one part another big part the

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:37,020
nonverbal communication on the one hand

00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:40,080
the power verbal communication it's all

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:46,760
about your voice the volume of your

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:49,650
voice the speech rate the intonation the

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,790
articulation the speech melody and the

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:56,310
voice itself do you like this voice or

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:59,700
is it very exhausting for you something

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,209
like that and we have another part the

00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,449
body line

00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:08,069
which that's the way our facial

00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:13,970
expressions are the guests church we are

00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:16,740
using our body posture eye contact

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,889
clothing even clothing as a part of

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,980
communication do I want to belong to a

00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:25,949
group or do I want to protest or

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,559
something like that and and this is the

00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:32,189
end of old as part of communication our

00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:34,819
body chemistry the words about body

00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:40,139
chemistry is we can't influence it it

00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:42,600
happens if we want or not body chemistry

00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:50,639
is often the reason why we fell in love

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:52,079
with someone and we can't stop it so we

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,389
have to face that there is something

00:15:52,079 --> 00:16:00,139
like body chemistry but you can't train

00:15:54,389 --> 00:16:05,509
about this so don't focus three

00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:08,249
important parts of communication verbal

00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:16,579
communication power verbal communication

00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:16,579
body language I wish I please come to me

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm really happy to see you again why

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:38,200
not I said I'm really happy so why don't

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:41,730
you believe me okay thank you very much

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:47,410
um please dad stop stop stop stop

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:50,380
sunshine I wish I is the reason why I

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:53,020
applied for Tel Aviv because we met in

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,390
Ljubljana and he said hey you have to

00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:59,620
come to Tel Aviv and so I applied and I

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:02,860
would really like to hug you that's for

00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:09,370
all the organization team Huck you're

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:13,900
very lovely thank you very much what you

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:18,459
have seen if the court inconsistent

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:22,630
messages the relative importance between

00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:26,770
verbal and nonverbal messages and that's

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:31,350
very hard to face what we say with our

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:40,780
words has to be expressed with our buddy

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:43,840
and if this does not work the receiver

00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:47,020
of the message doesn't know what you

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:52,990
should think about it he's unsure about

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:55,300
what comes and I alert moravian has made

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:59,470
some studies about this topic and he

00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:06,490
found out three important numbers 738

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:10,150
and 55 seven is the impact seven percent

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:12,820
is the impact of words in an unsure

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,650
situation not when we know each other

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,570
very well and we are joking then you

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,150
know what I mean when I say oh you are

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:23,260
stupid and we are laughing and you know

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:25,510
me then you know it's just a joke when

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,679
we both who were coming to Kenya say hey

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:31,660
you're stupid and you don't know me so

00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,540
what's going on yeah why did she say

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,840
this

00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,840
so seven percent impact of words

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:49,010
thirty-eight percent is the impact of

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:52,010
your voice does your voice sound the way

00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:54,160
that the receiver things yes she is

00:18:52,010 --> 00:19:00,410
right she knows what she's talking about

00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:03,500
and you see the last number fifty-five

00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:08,090
percent is the impact of your body

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:16,690
language fifty-five percent body

00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:20,570
language and if the impact of words or

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,610
if what the words say does does not

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:29,540
match with your body language or the

00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:37,460
voice the receiver tends to believe what

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:44,530
these parts express yeah yes I would

00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:50,570
really like to come to visit you and

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:54,320
when you start looking at this in your

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,990
team you will recognize this behavior

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,700
someone says something but his body

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:02,930
language or her body language is totally

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:08,450
expressing something different it's

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:11,570
crazy how many times have you thought

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:17,180
about your body language and the impact

00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:22,610
on others I think that's not too often

00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:25,040
so let's start with it we have the

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:29,050
second time for changing the mindset the

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:32,570
first changing the mindset was that we

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:36,820
start believing that communication is

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:42,070
very important the second time now is

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:45,130
changing your attitude towards your

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:48,900
communication partner I am okay

00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:53,980
you are okay this is the only useful

00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:57,220
attitude for communication on I level it

00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,530
does not depend on your knowledge or the

00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,530
knowledge of your communication partner

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:06,160
it does not depend on the hierarchy

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:10,480
level you both are your three are it's

00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:14,380
just your attitude towards the person

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:18,610
you are communicating with I am ok you

00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:21,520
ok we both are on I level there are

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,560
different attitudes like I'm okay you

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,600
are not okay this means i know

00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,650
everything and you don't know anything

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,530
so i will be kind and tell you something

00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:35,830
about it okay it's like the teacher

00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:38,500
perspective oh I am NOT okay and you are

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,300
ok so I know don't know anything and you

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,240
know everything so please please please

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:46,330
help me because I won't solve this

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,610
problem on my own I am okay you are okay

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:54,400
that's the right attitude within a team

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:56,530
and it's important for both it's

00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,150
important for the center and for the

00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:03,880
receiver because it influences the

00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,590
process of communication in a very hard

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:12,520
way so let's have a look what happens in

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:15,910
this chain of communication yeah the top

00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:19,390
is the sender the Santa wants to send a

00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:22,240
message and he starts with encoding this

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,840
message this happens not in your

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,650
conscience you do it automatically yeah

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:34,840
then when the message is encoded you are

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:38,080
sending it and here the process of

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:42,760
receiving is starting the first step is

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,850
to decode this message after it is

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:49,240
decoded it runs through a further like a

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:54,490
coffee filter but this filter and that's

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:57,789
very important its individual to each

00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:00,479
person the filter could be the

00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:05,379
periences you have made so our

00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:08,729
experiences are all different they feel

00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:14,679
that could also be your knowledge your

00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:17,710
actual mood or biases prejudices you

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:21,700
have against this topic or against the

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:24,989
sender whatever after this information

00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:28,989
which has run through the filter the

00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:32,200
interpretation starts the receiver

00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:37,809
starts to interpretate the information

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:45,940
and due to this interpretation emotions

00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:51,519
come up and all these emotions causes a

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:54,849
reaction communication is always about

00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,979
emotion this does not have to be always

00:23:54,849 --> 00:24:00,190
the emotion of starting laughing

00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:04,419
starting crying or whatever this could

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:07,210
be just feeling inside of you just small

00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:08,919
feeling I feel well with this person or

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:18,159
I don't like this person or whatever

00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:23,609
yeah and the problem is that is filled

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:28,450
us I'm mostly unknown to ourselves as a

00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:32,470
receiver end to the sender so the sender

00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:37,629
has no possibility to influence the

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:41,470
filters but it's good to know about this

00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:46,359
because when I know how this process

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:50,049
works I can try to give the full range

00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:57,849
range of information the sender needs

00:24:50,049 --> 00:25:01,509
for a hopeful good interpretation often

00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:04,299
the lack of information not talking

00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:08,200
enough about the topic is the reason

00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:10,900
that misunderstandings appear we want to

00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:15,430
save time so we try to keep

00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:23,520
short in our messaging but that doesn't

00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:26,950
always work so that's a more complex

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,710
model of communication of the sender

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:33,580
receiver model where I've worked in all

00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:38,260
those filters the sender the initiator

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:40,630
starts to communicate he encodes this

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:45,600
message in the verbal or nonverbal way

00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:48,790
and then the receiver starts decoding

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,790
the information runs through the filters

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:54,940
the interpretation starts the emotion

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:58,270
starts and the receiver starts to react

00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:02,260
we're starting this reaction this could

00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:05,920
just be a facial expression he becomes a

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,850
sender himself and the process goes on

00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:13,270
in this direction this means

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:18,220
communication is always a be directional

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:21,250
and parallel process communication does

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,680
not work only one way they are stopped

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:27,520
and work the other way around it's all

00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,920
the time between the communication

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:35,200
partners we are always sending and

00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:37,390
receiving and that's the way why

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,470
communication is so complicated and

00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:44,230
that's the reason when you talk about

00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:47,680
difficult topics both sides have to

00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:51,370
concentrate on it it doesn't work when

00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,800
you are tipping on your keyboard or

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,150
something like this or watching a movie

00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,300
beside when you're talking about a

00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:04,000
problem because you cannot cannot

00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:08,500
concentrate on all things yes I know we

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:13,020
can do all things at once no problem for

00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:16,740
us but nothing of those things will be

00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:18,460
perfect so start concentrating on

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,680
communication when you're talking about

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,680
difficult and important topics

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:36,610
this is a helpful tip for the sender so

00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:40,510
that you don't have this assembly

00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:42,970
construction with wouldn't work when you

00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:45,400
have a look on it yeah you must have a

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:51,510
closer look than you see the with takes

00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:55,560
in it explain exactly your point of view

00:27:51,510 --> 00:28:02,670
for a better understanding explain

00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:06,250
exactly what you mean do not think that

00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:12,210
the other one could look inside your

00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:15,520
head I could read your mind couldn't and

00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:19,330
this is very crazy because we all are

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:22,630
afraid of the NSA or other secret

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:25,600
services reading our emails listening to

00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,730
our telephone calls but we expect other

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,960
people to have a look inside our mind to

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:35,110
know what we want to say I don't want

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,260
anybody to look in my mind and know what

00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:41,980
I'm thinking what I want to tell you

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:44,650
something then I have to do it if you

00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:47,650
want to tell somebody something then you

00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:53,710
have to do it explain it very well take

00:28:47,650 --> 00:29:01,780
your time for it and then it will work

00:28:53,710 --> 00:29:05,020
much much better there's also helpful

00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:09,610
tip for the receiver because

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:12,010
communication is for both sides both

00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:18,790
sides need to know how communication

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:21,430
works ask questions if there is a huge

00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:26,790
scope for your interpretation if it is

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:31,930
not clear what the sender wants to say

00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:33,040
ask and then he will hopefully explain

00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,590
it

00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:39,190
there's no problem about asking

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:42,700
questions it's much better than making

00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:46,210
up your own mind and start to worry

00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:49,570
about what your head made out of this

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:52,870
interpretation and try to clear up the

00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:56,380
situation afterwards because they took

00:29:52,870 --> 00:30:01,510
much more time than asking a question

00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:04,240
and talking about it so very helpful

00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:07,720
asked question if the scalp for

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,840
interpretation is too huge it saves time

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,730
at the end and that's what we said

00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,300
what's the problem is not only an IT

00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:22,330
project but also in communication back

00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:23,650
communication it costs time have you

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:32,590
ever heard about nonviolent

00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:36,850
communication oh oh it's much more than

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:38,920
the book books are very nice because you

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:41,500
can put books into yourself and say oh

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:44,860
I've got a bug but it's very important

00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:48,460
to read in this book and to understand

00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:51,250
what it wants to say and try to adopt

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:55,150
some of these tools they are talking

00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:58,330
about nonviolent communication is the

00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:01,750
smart way for communication nonviolent

00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:06,460
communication says that you don't have

00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:12,910
to put yourself as the measure of all

00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:16,650
things sounds a little crazy when you

00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:19,570
use the topic of the method of

00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:24,400
nonviolent communication you talk about

00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:27,940
your impression how it feels to you to

00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:31,330
your feelings and you help to improve

00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,120
the situation with giving your ideas and

00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:38,530
your wishes what you want to get out of

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:41,500
the situation and that's a really good

00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:44,470
way of talking in a team it were does

00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,759
not work hundred percent of the time but

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:50,419
when you

00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:53,329
I to put it into your daily life step by

00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:55,519
step one percent more one percent more

00:31:53,329 --> 00:32:03,440
one percent more your communication will

00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:06,139
better a lot this means oh then we are

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:14,809
talking about problems you are not

00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:18,639
interested in this is right no I could

00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:21,679
say when i use nonviolent communication

00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:24,109
away okay always when we are talking

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,239
about problems i have got the impression

00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:28,219
that you are not interested in because

00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:32,179
you have your your phone in your hand

00:32:28,219 --> 00:32:33,559
your laptop on your legs and I have the

00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:37,159
impression that you do not listen I

00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:39,379
would I feel I worry about this because

00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:42,799
i think this problem is very important

00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:45,799
for us so i would like you to stop

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,109
playing with your phone and start

00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:50,449
talking with me and given me your idea

00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:53,379
so we could discuss about our ideas

00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:57,549
that's nonviolent communication I

00:32:53,379 --> 00:33:02,479
described my feelings my emotions and

00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:04,879
try to explain what I wish what my idea

00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:07,699
of solution could be so we are in the

00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:09,679
process of dialogue when I say you are

00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:14,419
not interested in this topic it's

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,699
absolute yeah so it's an absolute

00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:18,919
judgment and that's not the way we could

00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:22,399
start a dialogue a dialogue is something

00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:24,859
both partners on I level and it doesn't

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:30,589
work when I judge about somebody else

00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:35,919
that's nonviolent communication express

00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:35,919
with your words what you are feeling

00:33:35,949 --> 00:33:47,629
show appreciation one show appreciation

00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:53,419
is a very important part of

00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:57,159
communication each team member needs to

00:33:53,419 --> 00:34:00,600
know the personal value to the team

00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:06,210
what's my value to you what's my

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:09,770
are you to the team each team member

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:12,600
should enjoy working in the team

00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:18,330
enjoying work is something very good

00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:21,780
very helpful each team member should

00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:35,640
feel like being a part of the team and

00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:46,710
not outside of the team and each I think

00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:48,590
the batteries are low okay each team

00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:51,450
member should feel well in the team

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:54,710
appreciation is very important when

00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:58,440
everyone knows has value in the team

00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:02,820
then we can talk about mistakes we can

00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:05,460
give feedback without any trouble if you

00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,730
don't know your value to your team and

00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:12,360
if you don't feel appreciated it's hard

00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:15,270
to stand feedback it's hard to talk

00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:18,420
about mistakes because you have always

00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:21,090
the impression that you're not good

00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:25,640
enough because you don't know what the

00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:30,660
others think in the positive way of you

00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:35,940
so the takeaways communication is a

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:39,420
complex and important topic we are no

00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:43,160
masters of communications so that's what

00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:45,660
we have to face invest in better

00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:49,890
communication it would save time and

00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:53,400
money there are experts who could help

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:58,650
you and that's very important to know

00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:05,400
and to use I am ok urk is the only

00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:08,190
useful mindset for a communication which

00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,970
is on I level for communication which

00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:14,670
has the meaning of a dialogue not an

00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:21,480
only more discussion by the dialogue

00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:24,330
to come to solutions take time to

00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:31,790
describe exactly your point of view your

00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:38,910
impressions etc ask questions and avoid

00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:40,850
misunderstandings and think about the

00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:43,940
method of non-violent communication

00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:48,300
which will help you to ease some

00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:52,410
difficult situations and last but not

00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:58,890
least show appreciation that are eight

00:36:52,410 --> 00:37:04,080
very important takeaways communication

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:11,100
is about feelings and emotions all the

00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:15,900
time even if it's a male team even males

00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:23,990
have emotions and feelings even people

00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:27,030
from tech have emotions and feelings so

00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:31,290
communication is always about emotions

00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:36,450
and feelings and when diversity comes

00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:42,270
into the team gender diversity feelings

00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:44,940
and emotion are already there a woman is

00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:48,330
not the reason why feelings and emotion

00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:51,120
come into a team suddenly yeah but

00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:54,150
that's what a lot of people think oh

00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,640
we're having a woman in the team mmm I

00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:59,340
have to take care because you can't stop

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,170
crying or something like that no not

00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:07,680
only women have emotions and feelings

00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:10,770
male have to so it's about the human

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,110
inside of us and that's why we are

00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,630
talking about feelings and emotions when

00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:18,750
we are talking about communication we

00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:20,400
all assume ins you have heard that the

00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:24,500
communication some parts of

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:28,239
communications are very very old and

00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:32,619
they are inside of us so

00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:35,009
thank you very much and I hope it will

00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:35,009
help you

00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:49,390
there any questions I thank you very

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,880
much that was pretty good the problem

00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:54,360
that I'm facing with is that because

00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:58,750
communications is such a sub conscience

00:38:54,360 --> 00:39:01,060
effort or or habit it's also something

00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:03,220
that to me it seems very hard to change

00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:06,130
and very hard to control so how do you

00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:09,100
recommend that we go about changing the

00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:12,250
way we communicate that's what I said

00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:14,350
you need help for it it's very difficult

00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,540
to do it on your own because you haven't

00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:19,210
got your own feedback and you need help

00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:23,020
from outside this hair could be some

00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:25,930
some guys of your team you say okay my

00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:28,930
communication I I want to know how my

00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:32,140
communication impresses the other one so

00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:35,200
ask you can ask them and try to get out

00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:37,570
the feedback from them but you can also

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,300
ask some people who are as I said

00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:43,210
professionals and communication who come

00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:46,420
and join a team join meetings but not

00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:48,460
also meetings daily communication is as

00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,560
input is important as well as the

00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:54,220
communication within the meeting and

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,430
these professionals can help you to show

00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,560
up where the problems could lie in the

00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:03,940
communication and try to give you some

00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:05,710
ideas how to solve it but one thing

00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,900
which is very important of Cup about

00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:10,480
changing communications you have to do

00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:13,060
it on your own you just get ideas you

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,380
got just get can get from feedback but

00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:21,220
the one who has to change it is you and

00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:23,470
it's a hard work really you can't say so

00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,620
tomorrow I will communicate in another

00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:28,780
way that won't work you'd have to do it

00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,910
step by step and that's what I say when

00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,880
I say we have to start our training for

00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:37,480
communication we have to train it it's a

00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:40,110
technique but the first step is to know

00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,000
what other people think about us and

00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:45,310
then we can decide what we want to

00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,160
change in the way we want to change and

00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:50,580
then we can start training it the

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,580
process

00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:57,020
I have a question there's more I think

00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,420
relevant for early-stage startups let's

00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,370
say you join a start-up and there is

00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,410
some communication gap and for my

00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:06,200
experience it takes a few months if not

00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:07,790
a year just to get a get it working you

00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,140
know really with some of that you don't

00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,030
have chemistry with it takes about a

00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:13,640
year until you get to know each other

00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:15,590
really but by the time I mean a year is

00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,930
very long time for a startup so the

00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:20,030
question is how can you I mean it you

00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,260
can start taking consultants and you

00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:23,780
know all kinds of stuff but you need

00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,850
like very very fast to ramp up your team

00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:30,140
and for the exceptional you know good

00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:31,910
interviews like what do you do and to

00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:34,640
improve communication there's nothing

00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:38,270
which works very fast so that's very

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,730
important but what works very fast is to

00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:43,160
know that there could problems appear

00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:46,550
and that you are aware of that and that

00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,440
you talked about and that you feel not

00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:52,670
good in the situation and something like

00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,920
that that you try to express your your

00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,750
impression of the situation and start

00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,480
talking about it and that's the very

00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:02,630
important process within a team to start

00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:06,380
talking about it not to say oh I won't

00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:09,950
tell about this you must know and you

00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,810
said you know each other very well to

00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:16,100
know each other very well is the

00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:18,080
situation which raises up I don't need

00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,540
to communicate that much because he or

00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,780
she knows what I want to say and you

00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:27,740
stopped talking to each other yeah like

00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:33,620
an old couple sometimes it works most of

00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:41,570
the time problems are the the yeah I'm

00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:43,940
rising so for my experience most of the

00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:46,880
well the most these fifty percent of the

00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:51,470
communication is nonverbal right it's

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:55,490
either email or Oh emails verbal

00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:59,240
communication so not face-to-face yes

00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:01,260
what it that way and for my experience

00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,410
as well like most of the

00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,510
rooms actually come from this form of

00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,040
communication because like you said

00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:11,670
seven percent is worse than the rest is

00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,590
like yeah I'm interpret it and the way

00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,960
you interpret the email really depends

00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,860
on your feeling at the same time and

00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,490
what do you think about the person

00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:22,560
you're prejudiced about them yeah so how

00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:25,350
would you go about and like start

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,940
improving that problem because I think

00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,890
that's the myth please for my experience

00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,870
when you deal with the distributing this

00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:33,210
is the main problem yeah that causes

00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:36,060
most of the friction yes right that's a

00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:38,400
very very important problem because all

00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:41,550
these emotions is body language and

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,070
voice part is not there and it's very

00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:47,850
important for interpretation and it's

00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:50,610
hard to write a joke down yeah so

00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:52,290
sometimes when we talk to each other I

00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:55,380
can say something and you know it's a

00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,820
joke when I write this you don't know

00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,550
this because you don't hear my voice you

00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:02,790
don't see my face and so you just read

00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:08,460
the words my tip for this situation is

00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:11,550
when as a big problem first of all start

00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:14,370
a core try to talk to the one the other

00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:17,670
one or perhaps much better a video call

00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:19,980
if he's not in the next room if he or

00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:23,340
she is in the next room get off your

00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:26,220
share leave your room get into the next

00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:30,960
room and talk face to face it's much

00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:33,540
easier but sometimes you can't do

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:39,450
anything about writing an email you have

00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:41,760
to it would be an idea to write hey

00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:44,880
there's a problem let's talk about it

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,550
when can we have a telephone call or

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,790
conference and then talk about it not

00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:53,040
writing prime you can write down the

00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:55,860
points you have come to in your car

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,610
later on and send it as an email as the

00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:03,810
details of your of your discussion but

00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:06,900
not first step the email with all the

00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:10,740
points which doesn't work and then say

00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:13,560
so not my problem anymore yeah and then

00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,530
you have sometimes a great loop of

00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,570
misunderstandings

00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,570
standings and it takes too much time

00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:33,000
last question thank you he emails could

00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:36,100
be changed by phone calls or I can

00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,950
preserve the presentation of video call

00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:41,830
Trevor but in my day-to-day work it's

00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:45,100
lot of procedure wiki pages which I have

00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:50,200
drawn I have to use it to the day-to-day

00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:54,130
tasks in my experience one I write it I

00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:57,280
never use it anyone use it and I'm

00:45:54,130 --> 00:46:00,490
wondering what could be done at what

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,850
should we change it in order to make the

00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:07,180
procedure which is less emotional thing

00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:11,020
at the area can think about it more work

00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:13,000
full useful more valuable when you write

00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,650
something you have a little bit of time

00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,750
about thinking about it when you talk to

00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:19,240
each other there's not so many time to

00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,770
think what you want to say so when you

00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,230
write something down I want to write

00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:26,200
something down try to change the point

00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:29,470
your point of view the point of the

00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:32,140
receiver try to get into issues and see

00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:36,760
the informations through his eyes that's

00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:39,310
the thing you can do and then try what

00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,930
would you think if you are in the place

00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:47,220
of the other one yeah try to see your

00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:50,640
information from the receiver site

00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,640
sometimes it works

00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:08,980
thinking the tree down and I have to

00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:18,010
write my procedure like 230 years old

00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:27,810
child now you've heard about I'm okay

00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:31,060
you are okay yes okay yeah but you know

00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:35,170
to whom this message is important and

00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:37,630
you have an idea about their level of

00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:41,260
knowledge on something like this so and

00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:44,380
you don't have to step much lower just

00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,910
see this ok I am the expert of this and

00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,520
I want to explain it to someone else

00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:51,760
who's not probably the expert of this

00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:55,330
topic so I try to explain it in a

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:59,260
language with words he or she is able to

00:47:55,330 --> 00:48:01,540
understand so explaining it in your

00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:04,060
words because you are the expert and

00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:06,400
explaining it at my worst words like I

00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:08,740
would explain it to another expert it's

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,990
the level i am ok you are not ok that's

00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:13,930
the teacher position so let's start

00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:17,859
talking about it like ordinary people

00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:20,170
would do so and try to get a step to

00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:23,670
level you on what you put you on your

00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:23,670
level of your receiver

00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,190
