we're going to have I ask me anything

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,529
questions alcohol teja any bro ah so for

00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:24,320
those of you that know no do not know

00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:29,980
our speakers we have avishai Jay Paul

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,810
and sabina and I wish I and Jay Paul are

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,600
consultants for many many years i

00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,790
personally know I wish I hey that's the

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,620
first thing I did when I was hard to set

00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:44,480
up his call him and then we're still

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:47,720
doing going over your notes and and and

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,420
sabina is an expert in training and

00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,160
consulting of communication best

00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,160
practices and I can also tell you that

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,930
avisha and jpool read most of their job

00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,640
is like you know do we need a load

00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,590
balancer and then they say yes and you

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,770
also need to do something about your

00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:06,550
culture right so they're all experts in

00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:11,590
you know and somewhere in the grey area

00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:14,030
of what is developed so you get for free

00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:17,150
consulting which usually would cost you

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:20,600
a lot of money I know and so you know

00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:24,770
and we also have five notebooks for the

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,900
first best five questions so just far

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,970
ahead we have a mobile microphone

00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:37,580
somewhere so just raise your hand and

00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:39,890
we'll kidding me somebody asked

00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,390
something this is a high trust

00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:46,580
environment so don't be afraid to ask

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:52,460
any question at all so why my ball

00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:55,220
doesn't count one would write so I asked

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,990
I wish I that in the intermission two

00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,729
divisions ago and he gave me a nice area

00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,250
and I wish she could repeal it it would

00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:05,390
be awesome the question is I have a

00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:09,950
client who knows he needs to test even

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:12,650
bodies on testing platform and no study

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,090
needs to do something he even body don't

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,490
let him to do it

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,260
but now that it's that he realized how

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,450
much work it is he doesn't want to use

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,000
it and we can't really work really our

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,950
relationship is suffers because of that

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,950
so I would like to ask all three of you

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,540
what we did you in in that case we have

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,120
that that cultural difference and you

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,930
have to you want to reintroduce to the

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,700
client ye made that do you remind him

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,520
why he meant that called that culture

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:48,270
choice I really want to hear an answer

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:51,180
for that one so the queer scared the

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:54,150
question so I'll give you I'll give you

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,730
the use case the user wanted to have a

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,500
testing platform he he we introduced a

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,300
place testing platform and now we have a

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,040
bag in the bug in the system and he

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:08,220
wouldn't build the test for it so we

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:29,610
can't work out one working so sit near

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:32,640
the client so if I got this correctly

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,890
you have a client I wrote a program you

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,690
wrote some tests for it it has a bug but

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,209
it's not willing to write a test for

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,880
that bug right okay and you can't

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,290
convince him to do that yeah and so we

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,790
can so we can solve the ball because we

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:50,160
don't have a test that fails is like

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:51,480
it's a holic doodle yeah I remember

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,430
because because that's what we did last

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,320
three times and it becomes a problem

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,370
it's now it's a problem so the

00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,920
interesting thing about that particular

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,150
case is they already bought in you know

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,010
the client already bought into the

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,440
testing framework they paid money for it

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,019
so there's something else going on there

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,430
to my mind about why they're on board

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:17,459
right you didn't have to sell them on

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:18,870
that it as a weird exam so so I'm I'm

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,549
gonna give you the consultant answer if

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,620
it depends like I don't know right but I

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:23,789
will tell you this a lot of times and

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,789
I've started paying more attention to

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,720
sort of the dynamics of things I was

00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,190
working with a client once

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,930
and this is kind of very client-specific

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,270
so we we can talk about things that are

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,640
consultant related but there was a

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,410
particular tool and the the it was a

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,820
startup they were very happy with it I

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,130
was working with them on it and then

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,410
they hired a manager and a new like

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,910
mid-level manager and that manager came

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,200
in and the way that that manager

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,850
established himself was to rip

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,920
everything out and put in their own

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,690
thing because that's the way they were

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,430
like I am the now alpha manager and

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,870
managing this team and look how much I'm

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,940
doing now it was interesting to me about

00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,160
that particular thing is before they

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,110
were it was a CIA CD type situation

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,610
before they would the code commit would

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,710
go in once and you'd get a build out the

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,360
end when he bolted the stuff on without

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,370
talking anyone just to show that how

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,200
smart he was they were doing something

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,230
like the same commit got built eight

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,790
times because he didn't talk to anyone

00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,460
so he was replicating work that was

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:20,970
being done so the point of that story is

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,710
that um there's I I would imagine

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,570
there's something else going on maybe

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,470
for that client it's like there's

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:30,419
something related to their their focus

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,370
so they aren't carrying as much about

00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,260
testing because maybe they're worried

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,300
about metrics or you know something like

00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,350
that so I look for what else because you

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:46,590
already sold them on it so there's

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:49,800
something else going on yeah yes I think

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:53,060
the problem is somewhere else and the

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,160
only thing you can do is really talk

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,260
honestly about what's going on honestly

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,030
what using about it where you have your

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:03,060
problem and what you feel about the

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:07,470
situation and ask why they act this way

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,900
and try not to stop asking questions and

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,919
listen very well listen what is beyond

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:17,940
the simple words and try to ask beyond

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,160
the sports one quick thing I'd add to

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,470
that is that I like your point about

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,850
keep asking because one or two things

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,370
will happen they hired you for a reason

00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,570
if you keep asking they will stop

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,790
returning your phone calls and emails

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,900
which means it's a proxy for we don't

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,280
want to work with you anymore which as a

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,030
consultant happens for lots of different

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,470
reasons but if they if they still sort

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,419
of engage but in weird ways that gives

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,039
you a lot of information to I mean I've

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,460
seen a lot of like we you know you don't

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,509
really

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,370
our consultant but they're just like

00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:45,870
here's your last thing and then no you

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,250
can't just get you can't get anyone to

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:51,750
reply to your emails you're like okay

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:56,090
what do you communicate via email via

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,090
phone or face-to-face what do you do

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:16,169
yeah yeah yeah yeah okay that's very

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:19,710
important okay so since I got three

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:23,400
consultants on the same stage so I would

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:27,150
like to know if ever in your consulting

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:30,840
career have you given like a bad advice

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:38,490
or an advice that you like regret giving

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:44,190
later and what was the verifications all

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:46,710
my advice is awesome I can't even begin

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:51,270
to count the number of bed advisors that

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:54,479
I gave over the years I'm not going to

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:57,300
choose one that would be cheating so

00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,060
here's a fact of life we can't always

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,900
get the right things and we don't always

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:06,110
know in advance and Eddie everybody

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,849
everywhere will do some mistake sometime

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,039
and this is a fact of nature I mean you

00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:13,259
can't go around it so it's a fact of

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,840
life and you have to remember it the

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,210
problem is that in many cases your

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,909
clients expect for perfection because

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:23,419
they're like hey we paid you that many

00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:26,250
dollars per hour how can we go to drunk

00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,840
your bread consultant are you know

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,419
you're not a bit consultant you did the

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,620
best you bring whatever experience and

00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,450
knowledge you have to the table and

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,159
that's what we're paying for they're not

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,969
paying for absolute knowledge because it

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,260
doesn't exist and you know maybe one of

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,089
the employees could have done the job

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,170
and maybe we would have done better or

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:47,490
not so you never know and this is a risk

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,310
you have to take and something you have

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,829
to live with it if your clients are

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,730
grownups and we all hope that they are

00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:56,170
they understand this if they

00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,380
don't understand this it's your job to

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,199
explain and ultimately it's about trust

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,510
if you can't trust you if you build

00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:09,699
trust with them then they trust that all

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,959
the time they will get results i would

00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,880
say because i don't think all my answers

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,730
are awesome or perfect i should say

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,399
they're all awesome but not perfect the

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,440
mistakes that I've made generally tend

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,959
to be around I provided a technical

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,519
solution that I've seen work for other

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,260
teams but I didn't understand the people

00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,870
dynamics and the team dynamics and the

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,060
system dynamics with the actual humans

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,889
doing the thing and so it turns out the

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,260
technical solution that worked for three

00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:36,760
companies in a row before them doesn't

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,110
work for this company because their team

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,850
is structured slightly differently or

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,070
turns out that the lead from team a

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,720
doesn't like like like literally does

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,579
not like the lead from Team B and in

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,620
other situations those teams worked

00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:50,740
swimmingly together so the technical

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,190
solution was fine so that's just for me

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,290
uh you know coming up with better

00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,790
heuristics as a consultant for like that

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,060
solution won't work for those set of

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,040
people and then yeah the the best

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,750
relationships you can go and say you

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,970
know I see you're having a lot of

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,709
trouble and I don't know why because

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,959
this has worked before for other teams

00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:14,589
so let's work on that together and I

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,300
find that if you frame it that way as in

00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:18,399
i can give you all the situations that

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,170
it's worked and i'm trying to parse why

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,740
it's not working for you they appreciate

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,329
that because because we're gonna like

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,560
consultant get a bad rap when they're

00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:28,089
like there's this one solution it's the

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,319
only solution and they keep trying to

00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,319
ram it down your throat even clearly

00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:34,149
it's it's no not working so i think that

00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,130
my clients at least when I made mistakes

00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:37,930
like that they appreciate that I have

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,480
you know owned up to the fact that and

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,680
also one last thing I actually had a

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,230
client we're about halfway through the

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,480
contract it was like we're not this

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,010
isn't and it was it was like a six-week

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,370
country I was like you're not getting

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,410
any I'm not providing you value and and

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,149
we're not kind of working well together

00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,500
so what I don't want you to pay me

00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:58,779
anymore and I'm not going to do any more

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,790
work and we'll do a nice kind of tie off

00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,829
but we didn't finish the project and

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,120
that was kind of uncomfortable but I

00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,010
think it was the best solution for both

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,820
of us and with there it was kind of

00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,410
communication issues

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,360
with the client they were hard to get a

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,890
hold of in fact it was through email so

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,790
and that was when I should have used the

00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:19,910
phone and I didn't okay i'm working with

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:23,240
people and on a very personal topic and

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:27,170
I don't give advice I just give feedback

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:30,530
I show up possibilities what you could

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:33,080
change but my clients has to decide

00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:35,720
themselves what I want to change and I

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,420
help them to reflect their position and

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,860
the way of behavior so it's a process

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:45,830
that after my job they are able to

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:49,640
reflect themselves and to try to improve

00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:52,610
themselves and do not need help all the

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,370
time just in special situations and so I

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,030
think I don't give really advice I tried

00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:02,090
to be some kind of a mirror and you can

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:05,870
see yourself and decide what do I want

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:08,090
how do I want to behave how do I want to

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,830
impress others and then I show

00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,860
possibilities how to achieve these goals

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:15,200
but these possibilities are very

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:22,460
individual because they have to match to

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:26,300
the person okay so a friend of my

00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:29,150
working for company joke am so we have a

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:32,210
problem is explaining the developers why

00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:34,970
they need to write tests okay so it's

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,760
not in common practice they're thinking

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:40,700
they're not writing bugs the code is

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,750
running from the first iteration and

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,610
this problem is like it's starting from

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:49,640
from app button so it's not just

00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:51,380
developers it's team leaders that

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,120
believes it's not so important so for

00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,820
example we can write the code and only

00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,740
then write tests for this code not just

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:02,800
in time and it's kind of hard to us to

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:08,900
understand how to initiate this process

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:12,050
so they will push back business in right

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,640
places to provide the time for making

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:18,650
this happen so if you have an experience

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:23,190
to explain how to do it right or any

00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:25,170
an experience in this field so that's

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,770
that's actually a very big problem in

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:32,490
many places and it's not only tests it's

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:34,440
a lot of other stuff first of all over

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:38,520
the years we've built a very bad culture

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,050
of developers segregating their jobs to

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,510
stuff that they'd like to do and stuff

00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,640
that they don't like to do like this is

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,350
a part of development but it's a part

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,770
that they don't like to do so suddenly

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,590
it's not a job and we played along with

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,360
it and in some companies we allowed them

00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,600
you know the luxury of doing all this

00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,310
only the stuff that they like and now it

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,780
now became problem and how do you get

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,080
rid of this problem that's a very long

00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:06,270
process of returning everybody so the

00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,340
first thing and the first thing that you

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,920
have to do is to show them the value of

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,350
tests and that's a very delicate thing

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,790
because you have to start in mentem so

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,100
you have to write some tests that show

00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:19,940
people that there is value there to get

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,230
them to try it then when they try it

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,089
hopefully they get they have a good

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,610
experience with it and over time it

00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:30,330
builds momentum so it's a very delicate

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:33,089
thing you can't you can't force people

00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:37,550
to write the tests because then they

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:41,730
would be against it so you have to first

00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:45,240
do it yourself and showcase where it's

00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,770
good then get them to try it and then

00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,990
all the times i will start adopting it

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,180
if they see the benefit sometimes you

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,400
have to you know get them you have to

00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,980
show them you have to get the attention

00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,000
and showing them you see that test that

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,890
you vote two weeks ago that caught a bug

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,110
so they see the value sometimes you have

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:06,240
to help them see the value but again

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,430
it's very delicate thing and ultimately

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,290
if you don't get buy-in from management

00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:13,560
if they don't see the importance of that

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:17,550
then as a consultant it's very hard for

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,620
you to achieve this because this is

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,210
something that have to come from within

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,220
the culture of the company and Weeden

00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,500
from the leadership of the company if

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,830
the leadership doesn't care there's only

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,360
so much you can do

00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,430
so yeah I'd echo that I think a lot of

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,230
times companies want the DevOps right

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,870
management wants the DevOps because they

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,840
read about it so they want it and really

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,460
comes down to the reason your

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,350
competitors shipping faster than you are

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,550
is because they wrote tests and they did

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,200
configuration management they do all

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,550
these things and so from a management

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,860
perspective it's actually that

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,810
connection between the reason you aren't

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,520
succeeding in the marketplace with the

00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,690
metrics that you like her because it

00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,279
sort of you didn't eat your vegetables

00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,580
right it's time to eat your vegetables

00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:02,400
and write your tests I don't do a lot of

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,620
space in like testing and consulting but

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,810
I'll give you an example that came up in

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,070
sort of an operation space it was a

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,870
conversation that a friend of mine

00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:13,589
actually had and he was trying to

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:15,150
convince it was actually him at him he

00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,680
was the ops manager and he was talking

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,650
to the dev manager and he was trying to

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,890
convince them to sort of instrument

00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:24,990
their code so it was op operable in

00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,060
other words when when a when a alert

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,650
fired 3am his engineers could do

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,360
something so there's a lot of on the

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,860
development side about you know dude

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,360
developers carry the pagers and that

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,040
sort of thing and so the dev managers

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,750
pushing back like I don't I don't want

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,120
to carry the pager I mean we've hired

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,250
you guys to do this stuff I don't want

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,200
to be responsible that because I don't

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,640
want to be woken up at 3am and a

00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,890
critical moment there the learning

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,350
moment was the ops manager said my

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,500
people don't either and there was that

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,990
realization on the dev management side

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,970
that doing things around operability so

00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,740
that might be tests it might be logging

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,390
statements that are actionable might be

00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,930
monitoring setting up monitoring hooks

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:06,179
into the larger system was a benefit for

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,339
them so that was sort of the to your

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,620
point aha moment you got to have that

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,689
moment and whether it's showing a test

00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:17,089
that popped two weeks later that saved

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:20,339
saved their butts it often times comes

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:22,500
you know in these flashes you know that

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:26,730
flash of realization that you can't plan

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,980
for what you describe it contains a lot

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,110
of problems I think one problem is

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,050
leadership as you said one problem is

00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,990
culture one problem is responsibility

00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,750
and another huge problem is changing

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,670
changing things I have always done this

00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,130
way and now I should

00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,800
work in another way it's very hard we

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,020
have to leave your comfort zone and

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:52,620
nobody wants to leave his comfort zone

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:54,630
just because someone says this yeah on

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,390
to give to convince somebody to leave

00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:00,150
the comfort zone needs a lot of work and

00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:03,060
it needs a lot of good examples and for

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,130
me if you want to establish a change in

00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,920
a team it's very important that the team

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:11,400
lead is a good example and shows that a

00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,340
change is possible and what comes out of

00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,440
the change not only out for the out of

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,400
the change for the company but out of

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,650
the change for each single person and

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,710
another question is do they really feel

00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:28,620
responsible for the company's success or

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,660
are they just going to work to earn the

00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:34,740
money and go home and leave everything

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:37,560
so the part of culture am I really a

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,560
part of the company do I feel as a

00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:44,820
company that's all very important for

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:47,160
the process of change one more thing I

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,290
want to say that I think that all those

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,370
questions revolve around is that this is

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:55,620
not the job consultants change has to be

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:59,970
to be led by someone from within the

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:02,940
company when a consultant is advocating

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,250
change he's an external agent this is

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,780
creates animosity within the company and

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:12,270
is not well accepted not not as well as

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:14,100
when somebody from within advocates it

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:18,720
if somebody firm would then advocates it

00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:20,760
then he owns it he is responsible and I

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,120
mean it's easily it's his prerogative

00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,560
and right to advocate that change you as

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,810
a consultant head you don't have that

00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,520
right you don't wake up with the pen you

00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,750
don't carry the pager you don't suffer

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,190
the results you're not going to lose

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,920
your job of the company goes out of

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,200
business so I don't think you should

00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,840
excel expect those things from

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,510
consultants you should try to find

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:49,040
somebody within the company to delete

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:49,040
that change so M

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:57,300
em question if I remember correctly it

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,150
was last year we had a t-shirt for the

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,680
DevOps days was breaking silos from here

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,010
more correctly through breaking the

00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:08,460
status between developers and operations

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:11,490
my question and sometimes worries or

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:15,060
fears is that we're creating a new silac

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,650
or DevOps will be interested in hearing

00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,090
your thoughts on that one yes or no and

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,080
what we need to do to make that not

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,400
happen um so you create like a new silo

00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,970
there's actually a lot of people

00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,220
thinking about this now that that the

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,610
silo metaphor is actually not a

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:35,100
particularly good one in fact from a

00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,260
managing the complexity of your system

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,750
both organizational and technical

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,030
there's there's a reason silos exist and

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,920
they're not on their face just evil and

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,070
so I think a lot of times when we

00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:50,040
shorten DevOps to breaking down silos

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,780
that's kind of the sweet candy version

00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,330
of DevOps it's the easy to understand

00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,590
part of it I you by the way you don't

00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,210
see enterprise is breaking down all

00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,860
their silos like that's just not how

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,030
they're doing it and but you know people

00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,860
may be laughing and say well you know

00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,990
how to prices don't get it there are

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,590
some really good counter examples of

00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:10,050
really large organizations that are

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:11,280
keeping what we would consider silos but

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:14,430
they're changing how they do the work

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,590
and they're changing how those groups of

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,750
people communicate and how they cross

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,050
pollinate and that's just as successful

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,490
from a DevOps perspective as you know

00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,770
sort of breaking down the silos so in

00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,960
some sense actually there's this concern

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:31,410
that if we just wreck the silos and you

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,820
see like you know gif images of corn you

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,400
know grain silos being blown up like

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,470
that's just as dangerous than having the

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,730
silo in the first place because in some

00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,380
sense you're creating this chaos and

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:45,450
then hoping it'll work out right um so I

00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,250
just think that's sort of a pop culture

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,830
eversion of it it's actually a more

00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,050
delicate more deliberate more measured

00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,970
process than just you know breaking down

00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:56,840
the silos although it sounds great and

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,840
it looks good on t-shirt

00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:07,250
so um I like no I i I'm not it's an

00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:08,660
awesome patient does actually it's

00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,600
action you actually have two problems

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:15,050
one problem is a realization of work and

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,150
the other one is how to spread the

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:19,550
knowledge so the problem with

00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:21,890
polarization of work is that in a lot of

00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:25,880
places the dev ops team whatever you

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:28,400
want to call it is one is probably on

00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,280
the on the critical path of many

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,740
projects so it becomes a bottleneck in

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,780
terms of work for everything in the

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,150
company and no matter how much you scale

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,160
it it's still going to be the bottleneck

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:43,580
so you want to solve that problem

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,890
somehow and this is one of the reasons

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,900
why you shouldn't have a dev ops team in

00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,820
that sense because you're creating a

00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,160
bottleneck so you have to split it

00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:55,220
either to my groups or just you know

00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,170
spread the work in from too many

00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,120
developer things or however you want to

00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,070
do it it's not a matter of silos it's

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,900
just a matter of I know what you call a

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,120
project management of Werdum whatever

00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,490
that's one problem the second problem is

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,990
how you spread the knowledge because

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,150
right now you have a lot of knowledge

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,800
that those people hold again no matter

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,870
how you call them whether it's how to

00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,830
use Linux properly how to do networking

00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,880
storage whatever it is and somebody has

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,230
to have that knowledge within the

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,720
company that other people need to use

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,760
that knowledge and utilize it so the

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,890
solution to both problems in many cases

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,020
and again it's this is not the no

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,180
solution would fit all problems on all

00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,310
companies is to take those who this

00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,490
group of people and turn them into

00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:39,560
internal consultants you can have a

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,900
DevOps group as long as they don't touch

00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,390
production they just teach other people

00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,880
how to do it don't have a group that

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:50,840
knows that operate chef have them teach

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,270
other people how to do shift I i would

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,400
add really quick so a common pattern you

00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,620
see happening it's not just operations

00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,320
um you see it in release engineering you

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,110
see in QA you see this migration of

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,880
hiring people to do the thing so test

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,790
the software or release the software or

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,950
operate the servers two groups that are

00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,800
building tools that do the thing so

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,230
release engine

00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,020
build continuous delivery pipeline QA

00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:19,080
builds test frameworks that the

00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,760
developers then plug into right the dev

00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,280
ops team which is an Operations team

00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,310
they're doing things like maybe internal

00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,750
cloud or you know compute resources that

00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:31,350
developers can use and maybe they're

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,850
sort of managing the servers but the

00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,440
servers are connected to the continuous

00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,540
delivery pipeline so they don't really

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,460
care what comes off the pipeline you

00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,080
know they they just make sure the

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,090
servers are running and you know

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,560
available right so I think in that

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,240
regard that's kind of the internal

00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,890
consulting thing it's like we're moving

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,020
to a service oriented model for that

00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,250
work which is a real shift from like I

00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,480
mean I was released in June I used to

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,330
sit there and release the code and

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,220
that's not what you see large-scale

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,390
organizations or even small scale ones

00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,800
that are quote unquote doing DevOps

00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,140
doing anymore it's like those people

00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,490
right tools that let the business maybe

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,740
that's developers maybe that's actually

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:07,350
operations people do the thing on demand

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:12,240
on the schedule they need to meet their

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:16,320
commitments it's too and want to build

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,390
up yeah the perfect showcase for PR or

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,790
do they run DevOps because they are

00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:24,300
convinced that DevOps is the best thing

00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:27,540
for them in the whole range not only the

00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:30,090
tools not only the fast production also

00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:33,660
the philosophy which is concerning the

00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:36,030
people in the DevOps and when you drive

00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,580
DevOps because you are convinced that it

00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:42,090
is the best method for your company for

00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:46,260
your team I think then silos or walls

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:49,470
and no longer a topic because that's the

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:52,350
very essential of DevOps bring down the

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:55,080
walls between different departments and

00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:57,030
so when you are convinced that DevOps is

00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:05,940
the right thing you won't have this

00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:10,980
problem okay so let's optimistic

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:13,920
question I suspect that devops bring

00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:18,720
with it brings with it also a new

00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:22,170
challenge which is distributing the germ

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,210
of burnout across all teams so first of

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:28,830
all how do you

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:31,550
think it's possible to inoculate against

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:36,450
it that's one thing and the second thing

00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:39,180
is is another sickness of DevOps is the

00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:43,470
hero syndrome what how do you deal with

00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:52,350
people who already have it wow those are

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:56,490
tough ones i have been on dev up days

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:58,740
amsterdam and there was one of the well

00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:03,570
discussed topics was well being in tech

00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:06,810
and the part of burn out in tech

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:09,390
industry is not only in DevOps there but

00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:13,980
I think the question of culture of

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:15,990
talking with each other of going in two

00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,880
different departments and trying to

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:20,820
solve problems together is a very

00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,960
important thing to feel a little lot

00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:27,300
better in your work so I would point you

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,030
to Jennifer Davis has a presentation

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,890
called from hero to zero where she talks

00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:34,470
about hero culture and actually going to

00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,450
I don't know if she calls a zero culture

00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:39,000
but this idea that like we here I was

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,260
our bad she talks a lot about sort of

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,730
the problem you're talking about how you

00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,590
actually get people to stop sort of

00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,840
being heroes in their particular

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:50,070
organization so I would watch that I

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,800
know it's online somewhere um burnout is

00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,960
certainly a big issue I don't think it's

00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,120
actually DevOps specific I think you

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,410
were kind of asking around its DevOps

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,870
makes it spread right the whole

00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:04,280
developers caring pagers sort of thing

00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:08,310
and so how do you kind of deal with that

00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,410
that is a hard one I hate I hate this to

00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,920
beat the drum of it's a cultural issue I

00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:14,850
actually think in a lot of cases

00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:19,410
organizations that are sort of fighting

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:23,520
burnout deliberately have it turns into

00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:25,890
sort of an economic and people

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,000
management issue not really a right and

00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:30,060
so that's actually a different

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,590
conversation than DevOps right and you

00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,850
saw this before actually again as a

00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,220
release engineer I was burned out and

00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,290
and the reason that it you know that was

00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,730
a big thing is a couple things

00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,960
or the release engineers could never say

00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,060
no I'm not going to work on a Friday

00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,800
right so that was probably main problem

00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,080
B was released engineering was not seen

00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,510
as a anything that really added value

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,940
it's just something you had to do so

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:53,040
they never staffed it appropriately than

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,930
ever you know did that a probably so the

00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,600
nice thing about the DevOps shift a

00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,550
little bit is if you are responsible for

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,460
building a continuous delivery pipeline

00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:04,920
and not actually doing the thing then

00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,620
you sort of can actually mitigate it

00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,450
structurally because then if you have

00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,820
sort of a stable continuous delivery

00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,230
pipeline then you can commit code

00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,720
whenever you want and it should just

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,340
late through the system without a person

00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,540
being involved and then of course you

00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,120
might be saying well then we're shifting

00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,520
that to the developers right and that

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,050
again becomes like you know how do you

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,820
manage your people and then are you

00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,920
doing things like I see a lot of

00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,330
bastardization of agile where the

00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,820
conversation is supposed to be the

00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:35,220
development team takes they do the whole

00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,210
planning poker process and they're

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,010
supposed to be able to say no that's

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,930
what we can do this this sprint and

00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,970
somehow that gets bastardized to the

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:44,100
product manager or the product owner

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,890
saying I want these five features in

00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,480
this sprint figure it out right and

00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:51,570
that's that's sort of again that's not a

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,970
DevOps specific thing it's it's a sort

00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:55,830
of the way we manage that process and it

00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,210
is if you talk you know you do any agile

00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,860
conferences or talk to agile people

00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,000
that's not the way its capital ah'll

00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,280
it's not the way that's supposed to be

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,260
there supposed to be a mechanism where

00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:09,140
the developers say we are committing to

00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,140
get this done but only this amount so

00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:14,850
the way I see it it has the same

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:17,160
mechanism is an addiction basically so

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:20,070
like you stop thinking about why certain

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,500
people get to ops is because they like

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:25,320
it the journal in Eric's but basically

00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,510
they like the feeling of being needed

00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,830
they like the feeling of being call to

00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,550
ask you ever but everything and

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:35,190
everybody they like yeah of course they

00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:37,830
like basically the flames they like the

00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:41,340
adrenaline okay well adrenaline junkies

00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:43,170
basically and this starts a cycle of

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,000
addiction because like developers what

00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:49,080
they like what I'm like a lot of other

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,480
people they like you know whether the

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,090
free time for example

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,610
so it feeds itself basically it's the

00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:59,700
same with with what you call it fool

00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:02,570
Gaza in neutral that we have written

00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,940
Israel like everybody works crazy hours

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:07,440
and the results of shitty because you're

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,570
called the code that you waited one

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,880
o'clock a.m. is full of bugs basically

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:15,030
so you don't really achieve anything by

00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,890
it but it's self-perpetuating because

00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,300
then you come to the office the next day

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:20,130
and you see somebody leaving at four

00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:24,330
clock and like oh yeah you don't have

00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:25,800
ten hour for self-perpetuating addiction

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,010
and you have to fight it like you fight

00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,300
any other addiction you have to detox

00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,590
yeah i'll just mention that it's really

00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,000
interesting there's a push right now

00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,620
where it's talking about a job

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,120
description they're like you know we

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,860
work hard and we play hard and blow and

00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,570
it's like no I want to work at a

00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:43,080
reasonable pace and I want to go home at

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:46,110
five yeah and so here's the thing though

00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,150
culture yet culturally if you have the

00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,920
in fact you see this pivotal is a great

00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:52,200
example they expect everyone in the

00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,510
office by nine and everyone goes home at

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,600
six and the entire company does that and

00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,670
when you leave you leave right that's

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,890
the way that they structure their work

00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,390
right and so that is again it's a very

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,100
that's an economic that's a business

00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,360
that's a management thing that says we

00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,880
think that's more important than

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,200
replacing our entire staff every year

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,310
because we have a rolling of two

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,750
engineers leave every year because we

00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,750
just burnt them to a crisp

00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,620
yeah there's there are companies that do

00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,910
that in fact if you got different zones

00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,460
depending on what it is like if it's a

00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:35,050
ops context that's even better there's

00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,920
actually no reason that the people in

00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,210
the different time zone should be

00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,200
working their evenings because you've

00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:44,140
got coverage in in Ireland or Bangalore

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,660
or I'm naming places where those teams

00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:52,480
happen to be Colo code distributed but

00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:55,750
um I um so I'm glad you brought up the

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,230
whole working methodologies and mindset

00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:02,290
because I wanted to ask about in the

00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:06,070
whole DevOps realm a lot of the tasks

00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:07,840
are proactive like you're planning or

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,940
implementing something new improving

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,520
your environment but a lot of the tasks

00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,100
are you're just reacting to something

00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:18,160
which makes it a bit different not

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:21,580
different sorry I'm difficult to plan

00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,070
out your work and follow agile work

00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,500
methodologies so I was wondering if

00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:29,560
you've seen companies that do that

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,500
really well that they plan out their

00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:36,520
sprints and still in corporates did a

00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:38,560
new stuff and maintenance if you will

00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,050
are you talking in the context of an

00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,360
Operations team or a dev ops team yeah

00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:47,170
well ok yeah ok are you familiar with

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,900
 bond con bond yeah so the teams that

00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,340
I AC doing really well use com bond to

00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,610
track their work they don't do agile

00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,500
because if you tell a VP will be sorry

00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,720
we can't fix the site that is currently

00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,300
down until our sprint is over that's not

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,780
going to fly so the reason I really like

00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:07,000
con bond for this is that it it um set

00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,250
of time boxing the work its illustrates

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,620
the flow of work and so it makes it easy

00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,090
to have the conversation around um the

00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:16,750
reason you're not getting any of the new

00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:19,390
shiny flashy good like new stuff stuff

00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,880
done is because we are doing so much

00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:24,220
firefighting that you can clearly see

00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,110
the work is coming in through the

00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,330
firefighting channel on the comm bond

00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,560
board and all of the work that we

00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:32,169
thought we're going to get just gets

00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,510
piled up right and it's very it's

00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:35,950
visually it's very easy to see so the

00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,230
thing is that allows you to then have

00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,580
the

00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,639
conversation if you would like more

00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,230
fancy fund projects we need to maybe

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,669
hire more people we need to put more

00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,169
people on that team and by the way that

00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:47,570
people have been firefighters let them

00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:50,659
do the fun stuff and and actually and

00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:52,940
well the reason it the firefighting

00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,320
stuff is great training for the people

00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,149
coming in as long as you don't

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,790
immediately burn them to a crisp otoo

00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:00,500
but so the point is I although all of

00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,480
the orgs that I can think of that are

00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,160
doing it very well in an ops context are

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,260
using homme bon because that changes the

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,750
focus from the sprint to the flow of

00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,060
work and that facilitates conversations

00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,190
around do you have two people trying to

00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,290
support to ops people trying to support

00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:17,570
200 developers like that's not going to

00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:23,359
work out well for you so they can fix it

00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:25,310
that way so the I don't think that those

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,260
big difference in that regard between

00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:29,410
Ops teams and development teams because

00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:32,750
like the ultimate goal of agile is

00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:34,400
flexibility and the cycle of work that

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,720
you have in agile maybe three weeks or

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,190
two weeks doesn't matter but the cycle

00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,930
is the same you look at production you

00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,580
get feedback you see a problem or

00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,890
something that you think you could do

00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,960
better and you go and fix it or make it

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:47,060
better it's not really different than

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,730
what we do knobs the only difference is

00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:52,609
that it's shorter time frames and and

00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:55,369
even when in the context of development

00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:57,500
things you still have work that is

00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:59,300
unexpected maybe somebody found the bug

00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,580
and then suddenly you have to fix it

00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:05,359
still unexpected work and unplanned work

00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:07,640
so in operations part of what you can do

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:10,250
if you can segment your team to people

00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:15,250
you have one lane for unexpected work

00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:19,040
that you keep like off the board and

00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:22,220
listen this is a person or persons well

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,840
available immediately for anything that

00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,580
happens maybe it's an emergency or

00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,970
somebody just popping into her office

00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,410
and say and says can you help me for

00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,700
whatever it is and you can do the same

00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,770
in your development teams as well you

00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,590
just keep some little capacity for

00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:40,520
unexpected events the real problem yeah

00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:42,730
so you should probably say save more

00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,099
than twenty percent

00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:49,250
so that's the real problem here is that

00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:51,800
a lot of the jobs that we do even in

00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:54,290
development or any worse is not actually

00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,690
on the board it's not in any ticket it's

00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:59,840
not written anywhere so if you plan your

00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:02,060
capacity for a hundred percent or eighty

00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:05,570
percent what's on the board you're

00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:07,580
already over capacity will be our last

00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:10,130
question so I will just say add one

00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,359
thing to that um so so I've seen a lot

00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,130
of team to do that and if you have a

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,780
really disciplined team they can get

00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,190
away with it part of the problem those

00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,170
people start to game that they're like

00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:20,240
well you've got thirty percent capacity

00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,880
could you this feature is really

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,160
important right and and so I don't the

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,290
mott the hurdle that I've seen with that

00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,700
is people carve out the time and they

00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,140
think they can predict the future as

00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,359
opposed to having a conversation about

00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,070
reality it could be that in a particular

00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:35,420
operations context everything went down

00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:37,310
and a hundred percent of your

00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,730
quote-unquote capacity went to

00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,960
firefighting and so I just like the fact

00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:44,330
that we're talking about reality not

00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,220
trying to plan that we're carving out

00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:49,869
time for one person when maybe the whole

00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,869
team gets yanked by the way I didn't

00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:58,070
though they'll know note boots left I'm

00:37:54,290 --> 00:38:00,740
still going to ask the question and I'll

00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:07,060
be fine hey what's what's your take on

00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:14,660
the rock vs. no knock and debate knock

00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:16,970
here yeah knock is there I said

00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:20,240
it knock is i'm going to say it

00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:22,640
again if you have a knock then hey

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:28,730
you're doing it wrong but be you lie to

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:30,230
yourself sure I don't is that a big

00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,359
debate here I don't know that was a

00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:37,940
debate and I don't mean that flippantly

00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:39,230
so right so well actually to make sure

00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,359
it's so you're talking about like

00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:45,190
network operations center like a data

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,190
center versus all cloud

00:38:53,729 --> 00:39:01,209
oh my god knock center oh um okay do I

00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:07,749
don't know that I have an opinion on

00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:10,059
that um I so i think it is dependent on

00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:12,670
like most things is very consultant

00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:14,319
answer it's dependent on your context I

00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:15,940
know that Netflix effector roop and I

00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:17,589
were talking about this got rid of their

00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,749
NOC and that was a big transition for

00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:21,700
them and they replaced it with kind of

00:39:19,749 --> 00:39:25,180
thing they call it business insight and

00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:32,109
and they tackled it differently like I

00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:35,319
will say this i have seen large

00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:38,079
companies that have a knock and it's

00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:40,719
because the knock is in this weird

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,119
siloed thing so they deal with a bunch

00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,009
of stuff that operations cuz knock in

00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,729
their worlds different than operations

00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:52,029
so they are like another silo and then

00:39:48,729 --> 00:39:54,369
you see all the problems right so um if

00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:56,489
you integrated them right they wouldn't

00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:59,109
have that problem so my point is is that

00:39:56,489 --> 00:40:01,119
i know there are big companies that have

00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:02,949
a knock and it works swimmingly and they

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,359
have the integrated integrated that

00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:06,369
quote unquote silo with all the others

00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:08,019
and it works fine and by the way we're

00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:10,839
talking about the scale of facebook so

00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:12,759
so you know i'm not saying facebook does

00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:15,219
this i don't actually know but but for

00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:19,930
them it makes sense to sort of have kind

00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:21,489
of a more overall eye on what's going on

00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:25,719
but they may pull in people or whatever

00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:28,059
so I think it's dependent on whether or

00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:29,709
not you think you can do it well as an

00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:31,359
organization whether or not you have the

00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:33,279
data to show that you can do it well and

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,079
also whether or not it's serving you

00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:37,449
well I mean in the netflix case they got

00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:40,390
rid of the NOC because what you know

00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:43,420
it's all in amazon now so like why would

00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,949
you have one so i would say its context

00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,469
dependent on I don't tend to have really

00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:49,269
huge opinions on a lot of things except

00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:51,519
if you provide more context so if you're

00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:54,249
like where a 10-person startup should we

00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:57,279
have a knock then yeah probably not but

00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:58,299
but if you're you know Facebook or

00:40:57,279 --> 00:41:00,029
Google

00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:03,339
maybe it makes sense for them navalok

00:41:00,029 --> 00:41:06,069
yeah I'm going to elaborate man's a bit

00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:08,499
I've never seen a knock that justified

00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:13,299
its cost never ever I've seen a lot of

00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:15,249
broken then they have regulation they

00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:16,689
after I've knocked doesn't it's not it's

00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:19,420
not a technical it's not an engineering

00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:22,029
issue so we go go lutoyia sure it's

00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,650
completely different but if you ask me

00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:28,539
as an engineer I've never seen a knock

00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:30,400
but justified it costs never thank you

00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:34,150
very much your hands together for these

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,039
three awesome people and now let's

00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,369
loosen it up and get a beer and just

00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:38,369
