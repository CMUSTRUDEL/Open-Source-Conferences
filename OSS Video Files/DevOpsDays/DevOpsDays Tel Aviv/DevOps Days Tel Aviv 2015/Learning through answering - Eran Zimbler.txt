Recently I decided that I need more points on stack overflow. there are two main way to gain points: the first is asking questions and when they are answered and up-voted you get some points. The second is to answer questions, and if you answer correctly you get points.

By trying to help others I actually had to learn in order to give an answer.

And this brings us to the second point that by answering you assist at least 3 people, the one that asked the question, you that answered the question, and the random person that will encounter the question and answer in the future and will be happy to find a solution (or part of it).
