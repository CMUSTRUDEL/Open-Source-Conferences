Title: The Subtle Dynamics Of Leading Without Authority As A Technical Lead - Oren Ellenbogen
Publication date: 2015-11-01
Playlist: DevOps Days Tel Aviv 2015
Description: 
	http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-telaviv/

Meritocracy: a political philosophy which holds that power should be vested in individuals almost exclusively according to merit.

If you're reading the above, nodding your head, wishing it was the case in your situation maybe I can help. I'd like to offer some ideas and tips for the struggles Technical Leads or Senior Engineers are facing:

How can you leverage your skills to move the organization when you don't have the authority?
What should you pay attention to when giving an advice?
What can you do to get your concrete suggestions deployed to production instead of perish in the source control?
How should you work with your manager to plan and execute an agenda you actually believe in?

our next speaker is Owen Aaron bogan and

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,859
I have to say good things about him

00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:22,710
because he's my boss and so in a race

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,919
please show your hands if your boss has

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,730
ever delayed or canceled your weekly

00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:35,430
one-on-one meeting yeah okay

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:37,170
so now yeah so raise your hand if your

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,520
boss delayed your meeting and you were

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,580
actually you know depressed or you know

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,150
you said oh I'm so sorry why did you you

00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,540
know change my meeting cancel it

00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:55,200
yeah so we have a few hands so our next

00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,420
speaker is onnn Vogon and I learn a lot

00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,730
from him every day

00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,440
and he's gonna talk about how to deal

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:09,990
with difficult people like me

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:12,990
so enjoy thank you thank you yeah

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,569
all right so let's start so what I want

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,450
to do today and I'm really excited

00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,579
because the conference is about tools

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,549
and things you can and technology and

00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:26,939
things you can bring to back to the team

00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:29,939
back home and the the topic for this

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,829
conversation is the sad reality that

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,079
many times when you go and hear people

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,639
talk in technical conferences it's

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,399
really hard to convey a message and

00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:40,139
bring it back home and and you know

00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,939
bring this technology back home and

00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:43,889
actually put it in production right it's

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,950
so easy to go and read and hug your news

00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:51,630
or go to a conference and a few things

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,340
but it's so easy to get it lost and just

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,200
have it as some sort of a side project

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,499
an open-source project or a blog post

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,499
instead of getting into production now

00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:04,560
as being a technical lead engine and an

00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:07,229
engineering manager for many years so I

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,610
kind of want to share some of the things

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:13,470
that I've noticed from both sides and if

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,380
I do a phenomenal job

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,080
I hope to provide a few tools a few ways

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,540
that you can bring technology back home

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,620
and actually get it to production now

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,170
when when I talk about tech I usually

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,640
have my confident face and and that's

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:36,480
pretty much it right I think that I have

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,780
a good sense of good judgment regarding

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,120
technology and I always thought that my

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,980
ideas were solid as technical aid I

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,860
actually felt that the things that I

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,570
offer we're really going to help the

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,890
company succeed we're really going to

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:56,420
help the team succeed and I guess it's

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:59,820
like many of us I often time just

00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:04,320
brought some ideas back home and I

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:15,300
wanted to try try it out right so yay a

00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:19,140
glitch in the presentation surprise okay

00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:22,560
so often if you bring like a new concept

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,180
back home and you talk about it and you

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,530
convince your teammates you talk about

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,720
if you manage you're right and you're

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,880
passionate about it so you're going on

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,320
and on about how you can use it and okay

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,270
you can make it work and how it's going

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,200
to improve and make everything perfect

00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,940
make everything right and in reality I

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,040
don't know if that's you but I often

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,510
felt like an Indiana Jones kind of movie

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,760
where I talked and talked and talked and

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,930
the manager just you know pull up the

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,660
gun and it's a bank right shut the

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:55,200
up

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:57,000
yeah so and I kind of felt like what the

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,890
heck just happened here right I just

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,519
spent 30 minutes explaining quite such a

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,700
wonderful thing and and just you know in

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,290
a bank that that was it it it wasn't

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,360
always my manager sometimes just my

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,860
teammates it just say like yeah man I

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,610
don't I don't care like whatever you're

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,380
saying I don't care so this is kind of

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,019
the topic that I want to cover today and

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:23,510
hopefully make it easier hopefully make

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:26,550
it less like that and more successful so

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,960
as if I've mentioned my name is lava and

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,379
volcanic wait

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,919
I have a few hobbies my wife calls it

00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:37,020
work I call it hobbies the head of

00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,870
engineering at further where we provide

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,060
to online merchant decision as a service

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,189
where we get every transactions that the

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,229
merchant has and we're getting them an

00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:48,210
approve or decline decision meaning that

00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:50,400
if we believe that this this transaction

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,620
is legitimate then you can approve and

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,240
take the money and if we're saying that

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,460
do not the to decline the transaction

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,789
because we believe it's fraud then the

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,990
merchant can save himself troubles with

00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:05,039
chargebacks so we provided as a service

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,620
really cool stuff and great technology

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,770
some of it it I covered in previous

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,629
DevOps meetings but I won't get to it

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:18,000
now now one word that I really want to

00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:20,849
make sure that I'm bringing home is that

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,039
building trust okay and that's actually

00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:24,960
like two words right so building trust

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,210
that's that's that's the important thing

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,430
you have to think of because from my

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,370
experience when things doesn't work well

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,900
it's not because rationality aspects

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,389
right it doesn't mean that if I'm

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,060
suggesting a technology or a concept

00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,740
then by itself that's wrong it's

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,509
sometimes the case right it's not not

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,389
every single idea that I had in my mind

00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:48,060
it was a great one but often the case

00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,680
that even if I bring great ideas just

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,779
there's no trust in the organization

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:59,430
that I can follow through with it or

00:05:51,779 --> 00:06:01,050
with the presentation it seems yeah this

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,639
what happens when you do PowerPoint on a

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:09,240
Mac it's it's a shame on me I guess okay

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:12,360
so three assumptions one of them is that

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,430
three assumptions that I think that are

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,930
necessary if you want to make sure that

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,080
you can increase the ratio of the the

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,639
okay

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:31,469
maybe it's the the clicker okay that's

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:33,650
right oh the bundle anyway okay let's

00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:33,650
right

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,890
let's pray for the god of presentations

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,650
alright hopefully the last time so I

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,110
have three assumptions if we want to

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,810
increase the ratio of the ideas that we

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,920
bring to the table hopefully how much of

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,480
them will be embraced by the

00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,160
organization one of them is the

00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,540
willingness to build trust and I'm not

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,950
only talking about the technical lead

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,690
I'm also talking about the entire

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,390
organization your teammates your manager

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,280
to understand that trust is something

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,600
that you work on it's not a given that

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,520
the fact that you were hired doesn't

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,350
mean that you are trusted yet it means

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,120
that there is just the potential there

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,700
but you have to make the work you have

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,050
to make the effort to build a trust

00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,390
second is good faith right because you

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,730
want to make sure that people actually

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,110
have good faith and are doing things and

00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,390
are making decisions based on that

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,040
rather than their own agenda

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,680
which is obviously like sometimes a

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,570
fantasy right but it has to be there at

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,490
least most of it and third is is just

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,590
working with mature people right if the

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,240
conversation itself is not in that level

00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,710
then sometimes it just doesn't matter

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,010
what you're talking about it's not going

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,010
to end well

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,050
so I want to focus on two aspects one is

00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,870
building trust with your teammates okay

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,020
and one is is building trust with your

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,070
manager so I would like to start with

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,310
building trust with your teammates and

00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:24,550
some ideas that you can think of and see

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:27,940
if you can use some of them first any

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,620
level awareness this kind of weird

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,960
moment where people come to you and

00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,729
start talking and the only thing you can

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,560
think of is oh my god they did it

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,240
completely wrong let me explain them why

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,550
and you can see that they're just

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,380
bleeding right like production is down

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:44,080
and you're talking about them with them

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,140
about cues and priority queues and

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,470
things it just doesn't

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:51,380
at the moment so I think that technical

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,120
aids and honestly like every engineering

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,130
in the organization have to be aware of

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,040
the pain level that the other person is

00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,860
at and have to be have to have that

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,600
sense to ask the ask the question and I

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,670
feel that otherwise you're going to

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,560
provide answers that will make people

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:11,440
just stop coming to talk with you right

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,870
just being an that's not fun and

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,470
second is do you do you understand the

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:20,240
context that you're in because like the

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,120
best technical date that I worked with

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,980
really amazing people they have this

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,959
tendency to confuse the fact that

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,700
sometimes they they are the owner of

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,800
something and sometimes they're they're

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,540
brought in as a consultant right there

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,100
just because they are really expert in

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,570
this field so someone wants to hear

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,709
their opinion doesn't mean that they

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,320
want them to do their job

00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,940
right and third is the preacher kind of

00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,399
where you have an agenda or you have an

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,110
interest in the topic but not

00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,660
necessarily you understand the pains not

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:53,240
necessarily you can even make an impact

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:55,130
there and my my aim is to make you think

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,399
in every discussions that you are facing

00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:00,140
is which kind of role are you feeling in

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,519
that discussion are you the only earlier

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,860
are you the consultant or the preacher

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,329
because if you're the owner then you

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,529
have the responsibility to deliver your

00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:09,260
you have the responsibility for the

00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:11,750
outcome then in that case it makes

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,839
absolute sense to to make sure that your

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:17,089
agenda is on is on is on the plate and

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,000
and people are around that right you can

00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:21,800
set an example by by figuring out

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,720
different trade-offs and communicating

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,060
about that you can explain why you chose

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,010
a specific solution rather than the

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,220
other one and you can teach others by

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:34,370
doing so because you're the owner there

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,930
and the consultants state of mind is

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,490
that and this is I seen many many

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,500
technical aids and I've been doing so

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,550
for many years is that sometimes we're

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,290
trying to hijack kind of the

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,620
conversation right we are not the owner

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,570
in that case right and yet we are acting

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,920
as if we are we're saying yeah that

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,779
that's not the way to build software

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,149
that's not the way to use cues correctly

00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:55,160
that's not the way to do it and the fact

00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,170
is that when we bring in some technical

00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,279
aid into the room what we want is to

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,050
hear their opinion they're expert

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,399
opinion we don't want to hear them well

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,889
you know that's not the way to do

00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:08,209
software that's it end of conversation

00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:10,759
okay what they do next so D concisely

00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,259
pragmatic and and think and remember

00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,160
that that it's not your decision to make

00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:18,019
you're here to assist okay

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,749
lastly the preacher which is like a

00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:23,720
consultant that nobody paid to hear

00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:25,249
right the worst kind and that's fine

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,509
because sometimes it's completely okay

00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:28,220
if you have an agenda if you have an

00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:29,569
interest to be part of the discussion if

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,860
you want to go and be part of the

00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:32,120
product meeting be part of the

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,670
infrastructure meeting that's fine

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,680
there's no bidder but remember that it's

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,540
really really rare that you'll have the

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,309
understanding of the real pains that are

00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,899
being discussed in the room right

00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:44,660
because you're so far away from the

00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,220
discussion so just be kind and make sure

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,139
that that you offer things that you can

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,899
help them get there but don't force

00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:53,329
anything right remember that nobody told

00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:54,889
you to come to the meeting so even if

00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:57,350
you're one of them the strongest people

00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:59,540
on the team even on the company it

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:05,899
doesn't mean that you have the right to

00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:07,519
to force a way of thinking so think

00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,720
about that right every discussions that

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,670
you have are you the owner

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,920
the consultant or the preacher and act

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:19,009
accordingly thirdly be available I see

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,509
many times where technical leads they

00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:22,850
have so many things on their plate right

00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,889
they have interviews and they have some

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,110
really strategic infrastructure kind of

00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:28,670
work on their plate and they have so

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,949
many people coming and asking for advice

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,050
and they're kind of communicating this

00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:34,370
panic mode where if someone comes to

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,379
talk to them they say well this isn't

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,240
like no time no time talk with me next

00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:40,790
week next month set set a meeting in the

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,800
calendar and it's completely okay but

00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,660
but understand the impact that it has on

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,309
people right people will just stop

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:50,300
coming to you because they feel that

00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:52,790
they are bothering you right and and I

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,800
think business is an addiction right

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,980
that's something that you you somehow

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,839
enjoy just like too busy too busy yeah

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,410
how was work so many things on my plate

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,689
how was work crazy awesome but if you

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,610
want to have that place where people

00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:09,769
come to talk with you even if you didn't

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,390
they don't have to they just want to you

00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:13,340
have to make sure that you keep room

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,410
to be mentally available for them to

00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,050
have that capacity for them we found

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,850
just you know signaling this panic mode

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,420
and just you know don't talk with me I'm

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:26,600
too busy

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:28,820
go away and that's relate really really

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,880
strongly to the to the ownership and

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,140
consultancy kind of stuff where you want

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,510
to make sure that you teach people to

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,880
educate them and not to convince them in

00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,410
your agenda okay and you have to make

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,080
sure that you're helping them and you

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:44,330
lifting their their skills teaching them

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,070
new things instead of just trying to

00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,620
force an opinion that you gathered along

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:52,190
the years and like you know we all had

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:55,280
we all had some like I don't know how

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:57,380
many of you implemented their own over

00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,480
em right or experimenting with different

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,760
databases just to discover a few years

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,940
later then you just got it all wrong and

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,870
you just like do not agree with my old

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,970
self so make sure that you you're

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:15,950
helping people and instead of forcing

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:17,780
things and it's the same about it's even

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,030
more so with with with with your people

00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,190
it's the only way to distribute and and

00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,320
to scale your engineering team and to

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,090
scale your capabilities is by teaching

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,820
others so if you're a technical lead

00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,890
that the only is the only person on the

00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,570
team that knows how to do X like how to

00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:35,120
deploy something how to debug something

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,890
and you're not you're not teaching it to

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,600
other people then you always be in this

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,830
panic mode right because you're the only

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,900
one who is doing it so every time it

00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,490
happens in production like everything

00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,800
will stop they will call you to the room

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,170
you'll be the hero so again the

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,480
addiction kind of part and you won't

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,100
teach it to anyone else right and I

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,320
think that this exactly is the place

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,330
where you can teach to educate without

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,770
forcing anything just you know use this

00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,060
scenario where you you're the only

00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,760
person on the team that knows how to do

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:07,070
X and stop that the stitch teach other

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:09,230
people and I really like this quote

00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:12,290
because I can relate to it well when

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,270
you're a senior junior in a junior

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,360
senior pair programming I think it's the

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,830
best way to measure the success rate is

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,820
to understand how much the junior has

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:25,190
learned from this session right and even

00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,430
a better metric would be that to see if

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,680
the

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,870
if this person will continue and come

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,700
back to you for next time or it will be

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,800
the neck the last time that it does so

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,510
because it just it just wasn't like fun

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,500
experience okay so take take these

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,620
opportunities when you're sitting with

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,450
other people to ask yourself should I

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,279
expect this person to come back to me

00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,930
next time oh but it's so awful that

00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,709
probably that's the last time that

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:54,800
that'll be cold and that's important if

00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:56,630
you want to have a technical lead where

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,160
we found the authority and still have

00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:03,200
people to come to you and ask for your

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:06,050
advice now lastly about building trust

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,060
if your teammates is that we have to

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:11,510
create some sort of feedback loop where

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,339
we know if we've caught it so easy right

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,010
you make some changes and things either

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,690
pass or not or not you have tests you

00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,610
have production you can play with it you

00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,680
can use it and with people it's it's

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,630
much it's not more fragile right things

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,610
often break and you don't you can't even

00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,360
explain why was it something I said was

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,680
it something I did

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:33,050
was it something that I didn't say so I

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,180
urge you to come up with ways and I've

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,370
seen it sadly I've seen really two

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,640
little scenarios where it happens where

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,560
technical aids should have people in

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,390
their team where they can just sit with

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,700
them and ask them really difficult

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,589
questions right like you feel that when

00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,180
you're talking with me am i providing a

00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:52,640
like programmatic solutions or am I

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,190
talking too much right and do you feel

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,660
it am I'm somehow stealing the thunder

00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,240
of other people in the team or

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,700
overshadowing someone else and have a

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,220
discussion around that because being a

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,770
technical leader it's really in the

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,929
position where kind of a leadership area

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,459
even though without the authority like

00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,199
everyone in the organization knows that

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,150
if you want to do X you go to that

00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,309
person right that built some sort of a

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,579
credibility inside of the company then

00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:20,870
by default you're going to have less

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,670
feedback because you're going to deal

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:25,459
with many more people instead of much

00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:28,240
more code and people are just bad with

00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:31,190
giving feedback unless you create a

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,340
sincere way to ask for it sincere way to

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,650
to create this discussion and not being

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,820
offended if if something doesn't work

00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,040
for you or

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,300
if you hear it some harsh words about

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:46,340
the way that you you do things so think

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,280
about that hook you in your inside of

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,050
your organization do you feel that has

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,030
this Authority where people come to talk

00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,440
with them even if they don't need to and

00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,780
and you can say that they're doing it

00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,670
really really well and try to talk with

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,170
them just share share your pains right

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,550
if you if you believe that you're a

00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,200
technical lead and you see something

00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:06,230
that all of a sudden people stop coming

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,550
come and talk with you ask them

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,170
questions like maybe they'll have some

00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,700
idea maybe some of the people that

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,920
stopped coming to you will go to them

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,140
and you'll know and they can teach you

00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,470
explain to you why why why it happens

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,240
right so make sure that you have this

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,220
feedback loop it can be your manager but

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,930
I think that even better would be to

00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:29,990
have more people more of your teammates

00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:32,390
provide this feedback to you now I would

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,970
start with like I want to talk about

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,460
defaulting to positive now I know that

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,140
in Israel a cynical sarcastic kind of

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:44,770
attitude Israel is right and we know

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:47,390
best so I would like to start with that

00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:57,530
think of Google going to alphabet kind

00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:59,210
of company right radius to it right like

00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:03,440
Google is just changing their entire

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:05,060
corporate structure right a big big

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,920
business one of the most successful

00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,080
business in the world right is not

00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,250
afraid of making a huge drastic change

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,750
right just

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,440
disconnecting some of the entities in

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:19,580
Google placing a new CEO for Google and

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,880
we often worry about like excuse me but

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:26,180
like stupid things right tiny things so

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,160
I would urge you to to see if you can

00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,350
default to positive like people come to

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,210
you with with problems and it's so easy

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,040
to find bugs in it it's so easy to say

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,760
well that just doesn't work like that

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,680
right does that this will break and it's

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,330
really hard to explain people to take

00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,700
them from a place where you can actually

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,320
help them build a solution it's really

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,970
hard it's much easier just to point

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,190
fingers and say well this is bad this is

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,690
worse I don't know even while you're

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,090
talking with me just start over

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,950
let's talk in an hour right so make sure

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,810
that as a state of mind you're

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,690
defaulting to positive you're trying to

00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:01,760
think of waste you can help that person

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,380
again to create a loop where you he will

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,170
come back to you asking for advice

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:08,120
instead of saying well you know what

00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:11,740
it's that just doesn't helpful and I

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,740
don't want their opinion anymore

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:21,200
so to recap a few things that I would

00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:25,730
like you to think of when you're going

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,470
back home and and you're thinking of the

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,230
quality of work the quality of trust

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,850
that you have with your teammates how

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,710
are you do you have some good pain

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:38,360
awareness okay are you just sometimes

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:40,460
dismissing things when you when it's so

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,050
it's so clear to see that this person is

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,850
in pain and they're trying to solve the

00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,590
production issue and everything you do

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,850
is you're trying to teach them that you

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,720
know everything that they learn is just

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,490
incorrect and you need to fix that you

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,480
have this context right the ownership

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:58,940
consultant preacher kind of mind are you

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,310
available for them are you signaling

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,410
this kind of panic mode where just you

00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,160
know get away I don't want I don't want

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,870
to talk right now

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,310
I'm too busy focus on teaching make sure

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,620
that you have these opportunities maybe

00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,180
put a pair programming maybe some

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,880
internal talks that you have in the

00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:19,190
company so just use us to teach just use

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,200
that to bring a concept and teach it to

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,540
the rest of your teammates it doesn't

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,070
you don't have to sell anything that the

00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,320
end the goal of the meeting is not to

00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,300
like raise hands if you believe that you

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,800
know using eggs is the right thing for

00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,990
us doesn't have to end like that

00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,760
you can just end the conversation with

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,830
did you learn something new wasn't

00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,840
interesting should I do it again about

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,940
different topic and if the answer is yes

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,180
then you're in a good spot right people

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,010
want to just to listen to you and and

00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,710
think about it like you're working in

00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,790
different companies right now right and

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,920
one of the questions that you ask

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,410
someone who's is hiring goes

00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,300
interviewing in your company and like

00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,400
what is really important for you and

00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,440
almost everyone like ninety-nine percent

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,840
say I want to won't work with strong

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,210
people I want to work with people who

00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,920
teach me things because I kind of feel I

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,170
kind of feel that I'm just at the end of

00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,830
the potential that I have to grow in my

00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:14,960
company so you can you can be that

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,660
person for them okay you can be that the

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,780
one that teach them new things and I

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,520
think that's that's great so make sure

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,280
that you have a feedback loop now ask

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,610
yourself who's the person that provides

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,790
feedback to you today is it on your

00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,920
manager like is that the only person on

00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,660
it on the company that actually provide

00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,480
meaningful constructive feedback to you

00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,430
now if that's the case that's pretty

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,470
good like 90 percent best yeah better

00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:44,120
than than the rest of the of the

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,570
industry I guess but it's not good

00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,490
enough

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,870
you have enough great people at the

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,660
company that you can ask for their

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,890
advice you can ask for their feedback

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,780
and you're not using it enough we're

00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,240
only using like you're only spending our

00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,380
time writing code and reading about that

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,200
we're not spending enough time

00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:03,050
understanding if you're being able to to

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,470
come through with with an idea with the

00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:08,300
team lastly defaulting to positive

00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,490
because I don't believe that you can be

00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,440
in a company without believing that in

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,330
the in the in the team in the product in

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,660
the company that you're in so we have

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:20,270
this positivity in mind we just often

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,460
used like the cynical approach to get

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,170
away from it which is fine right it's a

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,700
coping mechanism it's fine but make sure

00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,680
that it's not bringing this kind of

00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,090
poison to the team where people come to

00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,560
talk with you and all they feel just

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,110
like you know everything is bad this is

00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,790
bad it's bad this is bad like who wants

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:39,500
to work in that environment right for

00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:45,520
the long term so building trust with

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,520
your manager now that's the hard one

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:55,940
yeah so let me start

00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:59,929
business awareness I say it's the hard

00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:03,460
one because we often have this tension

00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:06,350
where the technical leads think that

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,360
like managers their only concern is to

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,590
get things on time and that's it like we

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,119
don't care about technical debt we don't

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,539
care about anything just get it done

00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:17,659
that's it go away and oftentimes manager

00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:19,070
scraps gas technically it's as they only

00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:20,269
care about technology they only care

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,350
about technical debt they don't care

00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:24,350
about the business at all

00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:26,419
like why shouldn't be that way and I

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,889
will be three this is the kind of trust

00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:30,200
kind of broken trust the trees in the

00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:32,149
middle and and I think that both sides

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,009
should be working on it together and

00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:36,440
first you have to make sure that it's a

00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:38,960
technical did you understand what the

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,549
business what the problem what is the

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,139
business trying to do and what did what

00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:44,109
are the problems instead of just

00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:47,029
focusing on the solution so much because

00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:49,009
I've been to many teams many products

00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:51,559
many companies where at the end of the

00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:55,220
day we built great technology and the

00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:56,809
company couldn't sell it right or I've

00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,999
built a feature and it was a great

00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:01,730
feature and nobody used it and we just

00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:03,379
dumped it and that happens right and we

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,690
fall in love too much with our solutions

00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:07,700
then we're going to get hurt a lot and

00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,649
that's okay because we have some

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,529
emotional connection with the work that

00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:13,940
we do but I often feel the technical

00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:15,859
it's just losing perspective of the

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,119
business and I often hear that people

00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:19,580
like you know they're trying to optimize

00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:23,509
X while while the entire company is

00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,950
trying to optimize for Y so make sure

00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:27,139
that you understand whether or not the

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,720
company is trying to grow for revenues

00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:31,879
grow for the kind of business that they

00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,980
are bringing in are we trying to

00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:35,989
increase the number of customers that

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,269
they have like what is their agenda what

00:25:35,989 --> 00:25:41,389
are the things that that the management

00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:42,529
board is talking about so you can see

00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:44,210
you can actually be part of the

00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:45,739
conversation offer guidance there

00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,029
instead of saying well I don't care

00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:49,129
about that that's business that's

00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:50,450
 that's easy the hard part is

00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:51,769
the architecture stuff right because

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,580
studying is easy once you have the group

00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:59,000
the right architecture so so think about

00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:01,760
that and

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,920
you just you're just being stuck in kind

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,840
of like suggesting new ideas all of the

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,500
time and people just dismissing it like

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,780
yeah

00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,040
it's Tuesday again or n refinish is new

00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,250
idea awesome

00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,200
and what I would like you to think of is

00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,150
are you doing a good job at explaining

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,310
the path that you're offering to get

00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,110
there so for example it's one thing to

00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,640
say hey we should use eggs it's a

00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,620
different thing to say hey we should use

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,370
eggs and here is what I suggest that we

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,990
can get there

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,180
here are the small Mart on the small

00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,520
steps that you can validate here here my

00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,640
plan for if something goes like a

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,200
disaster a disaster things happen and we

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,630
need to revert here is what I choose

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,270
that suggests that it will happen and

00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,310
just build some trust in the plan rather

00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,310
than saying hey I want to go there and

00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:49,580
I'm not going to explain explain why or

00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:52,820
how a good metric or the good thing that

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,860
you can try to measure is that for

00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,260
example if you have a design review and

00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,690
people ask you a lot of questions at the

00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,190
end of it it might mean that you didn't

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,410
answer these questions along of the

00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,670
conversation right you didn't convey you

00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,800
didn't convey trust along of the

00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,600
conversation so many things were left

00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,600
open to the end of the conversation to

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,790
ask you that okay so what we're going to

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,410
happen if we have like the entire US

00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:18,050
East would go down what's going to

00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:20,630
happen and this is the big question and

00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:22,220
you should have answered it along along

00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,830
the way right it should have came up

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,390
with some ideas some answers and instead

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,870
of just waiting for people to ask you at

00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:32,600
the end so think whether or not you're

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:34,820
doing good job at building this path

00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,980
into the into the destination or you're

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:39,020
only talking about well we should really

00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:42,260
do like you know keep everything in

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:47,990
memory with Freddie's and and that's it

00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:50,480
okay lastly this one is really important

00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:53,060
because there aren't many technical

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,340
leads are good at that where it's kind

00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:57,950
of there is a feeling where they can not

00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,140
only suggest an idea and a path they can

00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:02,840
also suggest that they're on their own

00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,790
the thing right many times I just I was

00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,190
just dumping ideas on my boss right it

00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,380
just came and came in I said well we

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,270
should do X and okay I'm going back to

00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,020
work now you do whatever you want with

00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,380
it

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:18,020
and the thing is that we had a we had a

00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,520
guy in the company that we were like

00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,380
struggling with deployment and he said

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,160
well I can fix that like give me a week

00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,890
I can fix that

00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,630
cool okay let's give him a week worst

00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,530
case now it would take four weeks okay

00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:30,530
fine I don't care

00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:32,060
the fact is that that person was willing

00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:34,850
enough to take that commitment on

00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,440
himself was so rare by itself yet I

00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:38,810
would say like this is a great thing

00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,120
it's a great thing both for him and the

00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:43,310
team the other teammates to see that if

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,520
someone will take ownership on them then

00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:48,650
I'm game let's play this okay worst-case

00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,180
scenario we'll talk about how we can

00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,970
mitigate risk we can talk about what

00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,890
happened if things doesn't work well but

00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:57,140
it's so rare to see it technically so

00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,810
can also take ownership so ask yourself

00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,580
when you're conveying new things you

00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:03,860
bring new things back home are you

00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,630
willing to take the ownership and stand

00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:08,030
behind it or are you just throwing it

00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:13,580
and getting out of the room so someone

00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:17,630
else will deal with it now

00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:20,150
one thing about engineers is that we

00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,950
have this tendency of applying computer

00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,200
science to to the way that we

00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:27,920
communicate with people right how many

00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,140
of us are heard like does this person

00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,230
really needs like a lot of managing or

00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:35,600
is it more of a fire-and-forget right

00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:37,730
like a sink operation where you just

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,850
bring him work and he'll be in his room

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:44,390
writing code and then yeah that's it

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:46,100
like who works like that right you want

00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,720
to yeah you want to have this person

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,790
like talking with you and have this

00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,470
person communicating with the team

00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:55,310
what's going on you have to understand

00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:58,820
like is it okay it's not okay does this

00:29:55,310 --> 00:30:01,070
person need help and I think that

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,690
oftentimes technically don't understand

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:05,480
that inside of the organization there is

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,300
some sort of a API where people talk

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,370
with each other with estimations and

00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,020
deadlines because that's the easiest way

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:14,480
to make alignment around things like

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,370
even if you're working with vertical

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,830
teams right where you have the business

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,660
and the product and DevOps and the

00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,590
engineers and whatever in the same team

00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,179
even in the same room

00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,740
you still have coordination in place

00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:25,970
because the business like the marketeer

00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,470
would like to understand

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,240
well when I'm going to release this

00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:31,130
feature because I want to create a huge

00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,960
press release in TechCrunch right

00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,490
so again alignment even if it's the same

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,220
room even if it's a start-up of four

00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:39,470
people there is always this small kind

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,470
of organization API that is built around

00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,990
estimation and build around deadlines so

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:47,059
think about whether or not people coming

00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,370
to you and ask you like what's the

00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:51,470
status with X what's the status with Y

00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:53,690
or is it you that pushing the

00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,070
information out okay you're saying hey

00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,690
like it's been a week

00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,510
here is the status with some things that

00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:01,220
I'm working on some risks that I

00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,409
discovered along the way some of the

00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,779
adjustments that I made to make sure

00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:08,000
that I'm still on time or if I'm not on

00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:12,020
time then what's the new deadline so

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,789
again created alignment and because it's

00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,350
it's somehow expected that the

00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,690
engineering managers or the manager

00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:19,370
management will ask this question right

00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:21,320
so what's going on with X

00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:26,000
what's going on with y this doesn't have

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,620
to be this way if you make a pattern

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,990
where you can push the information

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,419
outside then people will have trust

00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,250
where they give you something big they

00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:35,929
understand that you're not going only to

00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:38,029
deliver it you're going to explain how

00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:40,820
you're going to communicate as you're

00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:43,640
going at it exactly where things stand

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,409
and they can feel more relaxed I won't

00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,029
say relaxed but more relaxed that that

00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:48,799
this thing will happen this thing will

00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:51,049
work instead of let's throw some

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,460
management on it and this will save us

00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:54,649
right because we don't understand

00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,990
anything that this guy says let's put a

00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:59,960
manager on top of him and he'll do he

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,760
will do this kind of discussions like I

00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,649
just don't understand the value with

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,899
this kind of management right I believe

00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:08,210
the technical dates can have good

00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:10,399
communication skills and they can just

00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:17,770
communicate well with the rest of the

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:21,110
team the rest of the company now writing

00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:23,720
something that I always think that I'm

00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:26,360
doing too little of no matter how much I

00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,429
do it but I think it's a great way to

00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,020
somehow make sure that you're you're

00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:31,460
concise if the message that you want to

00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,640
bring

00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:38,840
and I worked with great people who made

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:42,590
some amazing things and the level of the

00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:45,799
of their writing was oftentimes as good

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:47,840
as the technology stack and it just

00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:49,760
brought someone so much clarity and so

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,340
much focus around that to the team

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,350
because people who just did just

00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:57,049
understand what's going to happen right

00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,820
it wasn't like a one-hour story to

00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:02,720
understand it you want to do one little

00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:04,370
thing just conciseness and there are me

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,789
there are many places that can do that

00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,799
right there even like I've seen some

00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:11,179
great pull requests where comments

00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:12,860
instead of the pull requests were just

00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:14,750
something that you can learn from right

00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,899
so instead of saying hey like you know

00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,399
use a lock there you could actually see

00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:21,169
conversation around like why you

00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:24,770
shouldn't use a lock and why should use

00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:26,270
a different data structure to make sure

00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:29,870
that there is no there is no need for a

00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:31,549
lock and and just use every kind of way

00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,740
that you can to practice your writing

00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:35,929
because it will just make you a better

00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:41,360
communicator with the rest of the team

00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:44,600
and with your manager so recap again six

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,240
things that you can try with to try with

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,309
your team and with your manager so make

00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,380
sure that you understand the business

00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:54,080
make sure that you are taking ownership

00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:56,690
of the code quality now I understand

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,130
that some of you it might not be the

00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:00,080
case maybe the engineering manager is

00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:02,179
owning the quality that's fine think

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,190
about a way a path that you can get

00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:07,159
there again if you want to of course but

00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:10,399
I I sincerely believe that this is a

00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:14,030
great way that you can take some sort of

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,919
authority without having this title but

00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,750
having people come to talk with you and

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,460
share with you when they have technical

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,839
debt they will come to you instead of

00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,190
coming to their engineering manager they

00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:24,530
will come to you and talk about it and

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,210
you have a glance of what are the

00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,190
problems that every kind of person in

00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,960
the team has right and you can

00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,070
crystallize that into something more

00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,330
concise that you can bring to

00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,760
engineering manager and say hey listen

00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:36,740
I've talked with five people in the team

00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,330
and they're all saying like this area is

00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:40,339
just broken

00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,889
now here's what I suggest right we can

00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:45,110
do X Y and Zed and this will make us

00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:47,030
much more effective and I believe

00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:49,190
so people will be less kind of stressed

00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:51,320
or or just an a happy with dealing with

00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:55,390
this code because they're always coming

00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,520
back to me when things doesn't work so

00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:59,900
regarding path versus destination just

00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,130
make sure that you're building this this

00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,370
story right

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:07,160
don't tell like like you know he died at

00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:10,100
the end explain how it happened that's

00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,480
the interesting part make sure that

00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,800
you're pushing information like every

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,080
time that someone comes to you and say

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,180
hey what's going on with X understand it

00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,770
is the signal right it's a signal for

00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,050
you to be more open and more

00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:23,720
communicative on your side whether for

00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:28,970
them to come on a daily basis and say

00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:32,240
hey like what's going on last right more

00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:38,000
often find your way like it doesn't

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:41,180
really matter where just do it so what's

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,970
now right just practice just use these

00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:46,460
kind of tools on these ideas I know that

00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,260
there are 12 things here right and I

00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,390
love some of them just completely you

00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,310
don't agree if that's okay maybe one of

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,930
them or two of them or five of them I

00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:56,120
don't know you do agree with and you

00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:58,250
believe that you can try it that's

00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,710
that's for me that's you know more than

00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,860
I can ask for so just practice and I

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:06,590
know that if I'm asking that for you is

00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:08,390
it's what what does it even mean but but

00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:14,360
when these guys is it it's much better

00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:16,540
than listen to him thank you so much you

00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,540
can

00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:27,430
thank you you can reach out with or

00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:30,010
email me or whatever you want we're

00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:33,670
hiring talk with me later on if you want

00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:42,460
to questions or we are out of time and

00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:42,970
we're hungry for food questions high

00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:59,620
fives

00:36:42,970 --> 00:37:01,180
at the end question yeah okay so the

00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,030
question well what happens when you're

00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,250
stuck with this kind of putting down

00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:07,600
fires instead of just you know focusing

00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:10,780
on the things that I talked about and

00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:13,150
that's that that's a great thing the

00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,340
thing that I'm trying to ask is is it

00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,930
necessarily for you to fix that because

00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,850
again it's kind of the hero syndrome

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:21,100
where many times as technically where I

00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:23,110
was I was like extremely good at it like

00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,510
let's say debugging that's a specific

00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:28,840
service then every time it crashed I was

00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,400
the one that's doing it right so the

00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,010
question that I would ask is is it

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,120
necessary for you to do it and if you're

00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,890
saying hey listen like I'm struggling

00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,780
right I'm putting out fires everywhere

00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:39,190
in the system then I will do this work

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,430
to say hey like who can help me with

00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,900
that

00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,280
who should I train like I understand

00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,380
that I'm the only person in the team

00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,780
that has this level of experience but is

00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:49,420
it something that has to remain that way

00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,970
for the long run why okay so maybe like

00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:55,840
in a month or two if you build some sort

00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:58,840
of a way like training talk about it I

00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,660
don't know do something about that maybe

00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:06,390
you'll be out of like dealing with fires

00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,390
in a month or two and get there

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,040
