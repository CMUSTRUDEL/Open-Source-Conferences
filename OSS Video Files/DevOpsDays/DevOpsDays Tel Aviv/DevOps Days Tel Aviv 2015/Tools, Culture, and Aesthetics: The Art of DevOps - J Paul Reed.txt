As we pass the six year anniversary of the naming of that Thingâ„¢ we now know as DevOps, a curious puzzle remains in the forefront of practitioners' minds: organizations from ten-person startups to multinational enterprises continue to wrestle with what DevOps means, what it looks like, what behaviors it entails, and fundamentally, how to consistently implement it successfully.

For every case study of the storied "unicorn companies," there exist numerous counterexamples of teams in the trenches, struggling to fit the elusive pieces of "tools and culture" together in a coherent way.

In this talk, we will examine why these now school-aged ideals remain so difficult to implement, explore why DevOps is often described as "the movement that refuses to identify itself," and what your team can do to confront the dichotomies they are likely to face as they transform how they, their colleagues, and their company go about their daily work.
