Title: Tools, Culture, and Aesthetics: The Art of DevOps - J Paul Reed
Publication date: 2015-11-01
Playlist: DevOps Days Tel Aviv 2015
Description: 
	http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-telaviv/

As we pass the six year anniversary of the naming of that Thingâ„¢ we now know as DevOps, a curious puzzle remains in the forefront of practitioners' minds: organizations from ten-person startups to multinational enterprises continue to wrestle with what DevOps means, what it looks like, what behaviors it entails, and fundamentally, how to consistently implement it successfully.

For every case study of the storied "unicorn companies," there exist numerous counterexamples of teams in the trenches, struggling to fit the elusive pieces of "tools and culture" together in a coherent way.

In this talk, we will examine why these now school-aged ideals remain so difficult to implement, explore why DevOps is often described as "the movement that refuses to identify itself," and what your team can do to confront the dichotomies they are likely to face as they transform how they, their colleagues, and their company go about their daily work.

Stacy's and so raise your hand can

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:27,650
describe yourself as a developer a

00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:32,420
decent man you would describe yourself

00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:33,830
as an operation personal racer and he

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,350
would serve yourself askew a

00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:42,530
disappearing anything like that IC 112

00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:44,500
yes release engineers or community would

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,530
I describe yourself as a new business

00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:55,520

right with or get out your phone and get

00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,040
a notice a broke but we'll come back to

00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:17,769
this but everybody pick out your pick up

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,769
from the right with you your back and

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:24,880
write down the first words that come

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,880
into your mind here's the walk

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:46,579
so when I say that I'll t say okay he

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,409
said eposide keep it glossy come back

00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:54,670
with people okay so we're just about a

00:02:51,409 --> 00:03:00,139
month away from a sixth birthday of

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,579
DevOps days and sort of the word so a

00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:03,620
lot of people have been starting to look

00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:06,019
at this fact that I you know the fifth

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,909
year anniversary yesterday and how we

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,280
were putting about this you know and

00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:12,379
we're having it so I could sort of this

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,680
thing you know the google thing will say

00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:17,859
a six-year-old it aside would be so

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:24,099
maybe the parents at houses a girl

00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:24,099
securely me driving pretty soon easy up

00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:34,250
like me is driving me crazy interesting

00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:36,879
to make you know in terms of the

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,859
questions is try to sort of scale beyond

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,620
orginal thinking about that off is the

00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:44,889
big breath moving is it a ready for the

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:49,760
enterprise this is the CIO journal

00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:54,739
article two 2014 say now it will just a

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,690
box applied know their course you have

00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,340
another artifact that's it was also

00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,239
great in her class DevOps is real what

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,760
do you think about this is these are

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,140
collection tumult apart so there's a

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,780
little bit I think about disagreement on

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,560
whether they want a dog and fries the

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,970
options is ready for prime time what's

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,420
interesting to think about here is this

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,220
idea and DevOps is growing up that is

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,959
becoming more mature but we're finding

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:24,240
this is it you might think to yourself

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,740
well we're what you know did that that

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,540
for when you do is you tried both rows

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,480
up this amount of school so I did a

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,010
subscribing again if you send about my

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,130
kindergarten doesn't listen in school is

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:38,310
being bullied his private school is

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:40,560
exhausted it's a funny consider is an

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,080
amount of oxidation step up sheet set to

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:50,130
school is it is the other kind of

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:51,810
bullying a lot of people who smells like

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,610
thinking about that locks about how to

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,060
roll it out on organizations just become

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,280
kind of a hot pocket this last year now

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,530
this aberrant sports needs to be Hartley

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,300
profile began this year I'll talking

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,860
about the DevOps identity crisis and it

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,520
he actually argues that we need a

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,590
manifesto or the problem is that DevOps

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,770
might not be cohesive enough to stick

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,770
together

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,090
but of course madness is steadfastly

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,250
been refuted by a lot of people in space

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,070
and this is my cookies from already

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,630
publishing saying I like to find a box

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,110
as a movement that doesn't want to be

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,910
defined sorry this idea of the negative

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,270
space I thought was that you're seeing

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,760
that Patrick pointing at the bottom are

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,820
with him I hope according to her house

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,530
this was from last year he said he

00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,560
slowly outgoing them up to the moving

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,650
into the philosophy about kind of an

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,020
interesting way to put it of course

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,700
later a lady said imagining measure

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,170
commercial we decided reading their

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:58,530
lofts like new cuts it it's interesting

00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,060
to note that you can that reading of the

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,310
Oracle which is again a corporate

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,530
influence those kind of interesting to

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,480
me that particular analogy in his tweet

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,240
so six years a more experienced

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,630
intention not manifesto not ask us

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,730
though how we define it how can we know

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,570
what it is if we don't determine how can

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,800
you discuss it if you can't find so

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:23,310
interesting without and where is this

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,350
entry point and a lot of this is coming

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,650
from sort of designing a tremendous

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:31,890
Taylor I I went out searching about a

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,480
year ago this is the hawk certificate it

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:37,050
is real plans a lot of customers in a

00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,050
box so you get the liquor go by others

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,819
and other company

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,819
literally the demo gods

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:54,780
just don't match that's all it is easy

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:57,979
for you um so what did you say about

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,880
this why why are we seeing things

00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:02,900
because these want to be able to

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:07,199
replicate the dot they want to replicate

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,819
the experience that the uniform now

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,849
people familiar with the phrase you know

00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:24,240
for movies is that people know that

00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:27,780
phrase big fat either cash but you were

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,699
hoping things up thank you revert

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:37,830
everything that's interesting right

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:40,819
there any other ones up Netflix yes ever

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:50,729
know that's interesting one more

00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:51,960
facebook alright cool yes everyone's is

00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:53,070
interesting my roommate is a city

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,509
planner so we have a lot of

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,250
conversations but we're going to be

00:07:54,509 --> 00:08:00,449
because there's a lot of impacts a

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:02,150
minute ish both disrupted copy oh yeah

00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:06,980
so you this

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:09,500
the editor as they are given actually

00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,350
did a report for a yoga practice there's

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,540
no consistent the report is about

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,910
nordstrom in texas dog if some other

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,260
evening for companies to a decimal likes

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:27,590
to say big importance and just force it

00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:29,630
be better to our example ever so how

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,910
many people have tried to take having

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:35,390
the date right about one of these

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,430
companies doing and try to replicate all

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:43,460
sales copy to get out what's up yeah and

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:46,010
and kind of workout that bad yeah it is

00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,840
somewhat probably inconsistently right

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,290
we didn't have a repeatable pad they may

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:56,600
be good people pattern um it's kind of

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:59,180
interesting IM talk about looks like a

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,850
good to us architecture the facebook

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,710
which you do employed right that's why i

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,720
should try to go databases so i'm even

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,060
serve a 50 people who you might consider

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,200
top leaders throughout the space there's

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,140
going to be some name basis you

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,300
recognized I just ask them ah q the

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:21,470
exercise is to do what works caught into

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:23,750
your head now my question for you think

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,240
about you this is surprising I mean

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,870
obviously do a whole words hopeful or

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,310
words that stand up we did there's a

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,960
couple of ones in here that are actually

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:42,760
very interesting um actually some people

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:45,170
add one word that action that's words

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,529
and

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,050
yes all of whose privacy but Lisa

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:54,709
louisiana state which curious to sort of

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,800
reflect on whether yeah well so actually

00:09:54,709 --> 00:10:00,560
is good for that so what you can't see

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,139
 isn't there sigh is in there

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:10,130
but oh no is in there is my favorite

00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:12,410
ones enterprise corruption here are some

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:16,790
people is it was making their list wrote

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:18,139
words into pledge I asked that question

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,690
is because it's interesting to think

00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,839
about the context when you translate a

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,420
word and obviously some old english but

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,070
if you withdraw joining out rich

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:34,790
individuals lingers if they get sort of

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:36,470
natural enough so it wasn't you my time

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,850
working for tea pot why is the language

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,940
where that thing is that's why is that

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:50,149
important not so well they stood than

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:51,800
that in talks a lot of talk about the

00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:56,540
language of description is the languages

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,730
interventional so that is going to be to

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,070
affect the system to discuss it and

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:05,199
discuss pros and cons we actually need

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:08,990
absolutely shared actually prescribe it

00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:12,709
so a lot of people actually up you know

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:16,339
you many reasons like esthetics go back

00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:20,660
to my high school philosophy or politics

00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:23,029
but give you one spot and I did so I'd

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,680
say instead addition to my manager my we

00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:26,930
can be a brand new philosophy of the

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,800
nature of our community and tast'annin

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:32,620
HR deflation appreciation which might

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,260
say well how that are all involved

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:40,040
couple of interesting areas especially

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,949
basis of the same say is experimental

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,920
the status exactly people this second

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:48,019
all this area is like all day it's like

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,410
I'll just started trying to understand

00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:53,930
will eating experience beautiful what

00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,600
does it actually how does that how you

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,940
about is pretty interesting that it's

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,370
actually the second goal area of ecology

00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,220
and then how we can test that this is

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,829
where they stuck like social analyze and

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,010
mimic eye-tracking studies because from

00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:12,649
experiments today in contrast your own

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,449
aesthetics is much newer it's about 2002

00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,819
and it was actually i doing now we have

00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:19,339
all this technology i have neurological

00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,899
what chemical things are having our

00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:24,079
brain when you see something ugly or

00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:28,130
pretty or discuss patients what reaction

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,870
do you have it we are not many user and

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,830
of course poetic so that's what we're

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,430
going to talk about that

00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:36,740
Caradoc but today it's what you expect

00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:41,570
if you know a set of competing fashion

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:44,000
total show- duties in the islands yes so

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,340
fascinating is the androids image on TV

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,350
but certainly that and we're interesting

00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,770
a glutton research later they talk about

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:54,560
your mind into so websites web browsers

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:57,410
been each other's instead of darlington

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,160
they were being developed and como home

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:04,190
that's gay people they were coming out

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,580
as sort of the new area to study in the

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,170
cloud aesthetics narrator there's an

00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,610
area that we're talking about sort of

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:16,130
source code and algorithmic said there's

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,550
some real nuisance it what is a

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:21,770
beautiful what constitutes a beautiful

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:27,410
so we can spend all the time in this I'm

00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:29,270
not going to so I want us to think about

00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:32,570
aesthetics in the context in which you

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:35,150
work specifically the operational

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,610
aesthetics this is sin eh-tey airport of

00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,980
the train maps so there anyone noticed

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,980
pens begin to emerge certain things are

00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:45,340
chaotic certain things are very more

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:49,100
orders as more than that Arrowhead work

00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:51,820
processes of Crete and having a sort of

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,220
become very sad when you

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,180
we'll get aesthetics in an operational

00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:01,930
context ferments wasn't said that's

00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:04,000
where you be any things done well as

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,760
idea that we have an operational system

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,580
like a website or a service that we need

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:13,920
to provide it make sure the running on

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:19,300
time this review and the network's love

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:22,480
so effective unicorns for a second get

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:26,290
it described through Facebook's the

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,500
company's asset but it's up what my

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:32,020
heart cheetah um you might or what

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:38,140
phrase they use the Facebook paddock

00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:41,290
instead yeah so what's interesting about

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:46,420
that you can notice about a year ago I

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:47,920
think they changed it yeah grew fast and

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,130
stable at the circuit I gotta say I

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:55,630
don't know my belief that you change it

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:57,100
change it but I Pacific sorry but that

00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,100
that gotten through the first part from

00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,070
whoo that's right things affirmative I

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,040
company culture

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,330
that they find easy they can't tell

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,360
about the knowledge name actually comes

00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:12,029
from a facebook developer and hospice

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,790
and filled it with and he said it a few

00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:16,860
times in fox that he's given about

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,200
facebooking the process can AIDS

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,640
we hadn't developed infrastructure so

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,070
that the developers could do what they

00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,959
need to do so in the developing and said

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,779
you know I want to confirm ki ll

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:31,170
be on a million servers they they as a

00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:32,700
static value facebook site now you can't

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,190
tell a little fib now you need to

00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,320
architects solution to less about which

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,820
have a free PDF and then one piece box

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,290
is actually I have a business contacts

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:51,990
eating in that department so netflix

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:54,959
when we motored responsibility yes big

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:57,089
thing another one that people like suck

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,790
it up on a cotton bowl of the people

00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:02,040
contacts for credit control them when it

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,970
could be elements advocate for my stick

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:10,260
together seven pattern that's coming wet

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:16,050
winter is coming yes ready for any way

00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:18,360
someone yeah oh that's the solid so this

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:25,020
is the things they hung from instead of

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:27,779
confusing amazon adrin always right

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:30,730
there are big these are won by the way

00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,079
that I started you know so that's not

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,360
that the other they are calm

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:38,889
person or listen Japanese of sparkle in

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:44,920
the media executive particular

00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:48,880
composition this is my education but the

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:53,589
middle for said yes from the story about

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,120
Jeff Bezos back early I 50,000 or 50 but

00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:56,649
it's a nap around that thing is no but

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,810
if I said you will make everything a

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:00,430
service I don't care how you make this

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,260
sort of successful which will expose to

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,720
be a guys and if you don't want to do

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,370
that you leave and that memo not leave

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,260
right but what's interesting part of the

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:11,380
story doesn't he focus he actually had

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:15,280
someone hacks when Wendy was a xsarahx

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:17,140
military person and he said that person

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,140
around to different keep the company to

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,939
make sure that they were doing that

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,919
matter that much now that strategy for

00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,209
not work out very well for hours you

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,640
might say it was the right thing to do

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,840
of course this is kind of the implicit

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,900
point that I'm trying to make is that

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:38,230
for the sex we can talk about well was

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:40,240
it be thinner or we can allege that so I

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,610
don't know is the new york times article

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,440
made its biggest splash overhears if you

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,620
don't get our new york article about

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,260
amazon about putting your four years and

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,320
what

00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,750
difficult place it is to the tort there

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,660
and sort some of its pedestal sticking

00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,220
out from that but I put this in any kind

00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,360
of size talking to some people to

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,370
interview there and some people it's a

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,380
position there things and yeah it's also

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,540
somewhat will know that it is a great

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,180
and you're just four years in aerial

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:14,030
make your mind for stock seems you can

00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:19,010
pretty well and then we so that might

00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:20,900
get shirts now what is noted here is

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,630
that we consider all of these uniform

00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,330
companies successful but they're sort of

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:30,800
professed values and things to make a

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:34,610
beautiful occluding better teach

00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,020
comparative so I said this is the

00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,520
off-state Rockies earlier this year's

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,260
and culture is not important talking

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,620
about culture their law school is not

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:47,920
important but the whole trouble is

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:50,660
critical I actually would rephrase that

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,300
today say which is not important but

00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,160
shared extendable the reason that I

00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,070
actually made that changes uh I was

00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:01,130
shining basically about missing you is

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:03,380
putting out that alignment in a complex

00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,590
system is actually bad because it

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:09,770
reduces the adaptive capacity of that

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:12,350
system everybody's a winery reducible to

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:16,310
UM sure to set it is different than

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,770
control the values are similar but we

00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:20,380
can still have

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:22,690
about you know we all might like use aim

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,840
but we can talk about which paintings in

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:29,440
economic we like better purpose it's a

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,690
little different so I want you to take a

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,540
moment and think about what are your

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,220
aesthetics of their lives where they

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:40,360
include any of the words that you use

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:43,920
before as you wrote down ah did you

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,920
think think about what your status

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:51,520
what's up what's your organization's

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:55,600
would you describe them and share would

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,870
you think that they a lot a lot of that

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,290
work but those who can share their

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:04,630
phones so I sumit to say anything a lot

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:08,020
of talking about a foot saying if you

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:11,290
get off stop leaders I am guessing most

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,570
enormous repeat that were too but these

00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:17,710
would communicate right enough for

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:19,570
asking what are the acceptable positives

00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:22,930
are the Deepwater Asian groups to serve

00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:25,810
the customer go we said that box

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:29,650
estacada understanding the form is in

00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:32,850
the form of times the organization needs

00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:36,540
to turn for practices and ultimately a

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:38,980
huge issues are going toward worse me oh

00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,950
listen do a modern production in the

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:45,840
complex process neo-fascist upper crying

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:48,310
adults abusive that devops requires

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,310
generosity and there will be sharing is

00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,440
hard especially when workers

00:20:50,310 --> 00:21:01,980
perfect I see get off this beautiful

00:20:52,440 --> 00:21:04,440
wooden trays people together we kinda

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,420
need to see narrative focuses on health

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,090
and fitness of the fourth but then

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:13,020
actually follow this with the economic

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:15,240
performance in there 915 that also

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:19,280
minimizes the idea of Athenian

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,280
cooperation of people to learn together

00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:30,870
man exists it's interesting that

00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:34,080
humanity color blockings Abed I promise

00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,910
I'm not withdraw it this is a second one

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,700
he made about cell phones that we love

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,830
so much I daily deploys I really like a

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,780
fortune are what results we T Ford

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,850
single-piece flow so this person

00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,920
actually I was covered with the Iron

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,170
Eagle maintenance which he finds the

00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,490
aesthetic of the bottom this is my

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,620
favorite one they're not as it enters

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:55,440
into hi I people holder which is trying

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:59,790
to pinpoint so what did I am using

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,250
people that were in that list that's

00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,330
what they said I magnify you who set up

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,820
but I think it's kind of an interesting

00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,800
exercise know me these are people on

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,180
Twitter

00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,610
la Petite him other than hilarious jon

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,920
mullis patrick Bazinet interesting a

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,990
sort of honor from what you see them and

00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,380
what we've read a bit over which one

00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:24,830
would you match up of that settlement

00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,480
and if I gave me the answer if you were

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,030
right or wrong with that what would you

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,630
think about that that would not just a

00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:35,060
bit about so um I kind of variation

00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:38,120
fantasy fascinating but not a threat

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,590
alone in there even though so people

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,590
were losing our community existence

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:49,490
there's an economic component believe

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:52,070
and Hashem is very focused so so

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:55,640
probably a shared Emma office says

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:58,550
automation think of pretty pretty pretty

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,920
swell acceptance on me the source code I

00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,720
know that is I don't have if you're not

00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,340
doing it they're sort of questionable

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,800
people talk you into the rocks with us

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,750
pretty well accepted systems in Italian

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,480
streams of yet that we need to look at

00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:14,900
the entire flow of a mythical the

00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,660
developers for Amy to hop production be

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,580
backwards video blog version and if

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,100
anything you all spend a lot of time

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,010
talking about decent winning and

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,020
recognizable a section so that was

00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,390
interesting it's really a bunch of the

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,330
responses that they're talking about

00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:34,310
using the box to win right the sub title

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,990
of the beach garbage is how to use

00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,680
DevOps to make you a businessman right

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,890
it's going to interesting

00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,990
sort of a shared ascetic these might be

00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,850
more difficult to react on than our

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,250
DevOps community especially our

00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:50,850
worldwide ox community the iris is

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:53,640
masked discussion i'm gonna share

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:56,430
instead of application architectures of

00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,930
Interior and hyper services they bottle

00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,990
up at monstrosities I hope my house

00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:05,040
trust me when I pick it up it's

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:07,110
something about leadership people whose

00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,770
a lot of taking on the organization my

00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:13,920
back to sort of build on facebook not

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:16,410
all organizations are back so might be

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,080
interesting to look at your honor who is

00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:23,150
a lot of additional I'm sitting as a

00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:26,760
recent near a long time normal a stable

00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,830
a humanity main system design is it

00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,430
because it's comes up a lot in context

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:35,880
of post mortems on Falstaff what does it

00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:38,250
mean to be humane right and if you've

00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,860
ever have seen belapur walk in the idea

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:43,590
of a security pager I have though some

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,600
people create pages negative 30 hi I'm

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:50,150
teaches really it's really recession

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,490
about communities is your system that

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:56,399
will be something reasonable

00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:57,690
as opposed to just a job so you see I

00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:00,299
want to talk about especially in a

00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,909
post-mortem projects resilience is

00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:05,549
designing new cups and of course

00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:06,990
includes Incan city university i think

00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:08,820
is an interesting conversation about

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,799
some people think that off supplies

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,240
inclusivity and diversity and then

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,100
that's something that everybody who does

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,690
our auction care about and I know people

00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:20,220
that argued about something i don't i'm

00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,470
not saying one right or wrong that's

00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:26,450
slides expression the discussion about

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:29,009
these steps that you think are at work

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,100
I'm gonna so that was a kind of

00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:35,250
interesting the car the Toyota

00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:38,269
Production system hi prema community for

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:41,639
improvement stuff it would have to say

00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:43,320
to go fast you need to slow down it's

00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:45,299
interesting Mike as the organization

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:51,120
runs a team when is a good time to

00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:52,409
slowly is it ever so the listening

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,000
stadium with my electrical Gulf

00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:56,279
conversations because they have an

00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,240
elephant that is in every room and every

00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:01,710
team space and there are a lot honorable

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,299
obviously there are it's interesting to

00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:07,289
think about really awful conversation to

00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:11,070
you you're one of the quintessential

00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:13,559
ones channel does model d culture he

00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,120
founded it um she talking about cultural

00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,309
houses like this quote where's the

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,389
culture rrc culture

00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:23,820
is no one will say the g-list actually

00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:26,490
bunch of things that were said that that

00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:32,759
people often find a court apartment

00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:35,999
accommodation maybe ah this is one my

00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:39,269
favorite books the novel by Professor

00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:41,639
Stanford robert sutton um this is an

00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:44,129
interesting organization what is their

00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:45,870
aesthetic fit under personal question

00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:57,110
group doesn't organization Sturridge

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:59,610
what happened to me to Microsoft bigger

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,830
so I would be a really quick slowly

00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,840
right now Miss Catherine x I just came

00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,869
up an important and I'll miss all that

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,269
guy that promise johnny was what was

00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:12,509
talking about I was being a state of

00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:16,409
dioxins a Chicago I just earlier in

00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:25,019
three months ago and talking about sex

00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:26,940
in our people familiar people are

00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:30,419
looking familiar with that loss is

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,580
cooled and poultry tools and culture in

00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:35,009
the juicy portraits of tools right so I

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:40,289
want to see that as that probably our

00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:43,999
first sort of original notice tools in

00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:43,999
culture mrs. Emmanuel for me

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,210
so yeah and for culture automation extra

00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,740
chairs it's something today and

00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,380
everyone's andronicus came up with you

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,970
see it a lot there's a lot of discussion

00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,940
entire presentation on the Bulls are

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:03,820
obviously automation is more with me

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:08,100
then metrics and measuring how do you do

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,100
that when you measure this a very cool

00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:27,120
Cheryl now one of the things that Jon

00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:32,560
talk about is a new taxidermy ice ice

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:35,710
the ice and that's clearly a cultural

00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,970
thing he had a complexity what I think

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,040
is interesting is complexity does it

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,500
doesn't really fit and cultural tools at

00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,390
all so we might actually of our kind of

00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,720
core set of tools and culture you might

00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:51,370
add complexity is a different thing and

00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:53,110
then he is for empathy so where does

00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,030
this complexity thing come in the

00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,950
conversation of the discussion it's kind

00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:00,580
of kind of an outlier can out there I

00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:04,540
put it in a different column well come

00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,860
back to Dave Snowden and his study on

00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,600
complexity and his background is

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:10,300
actually psychology which is kind of

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,470
interesting one of the he was quoted

00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,200
saying one of the ways you change how

00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:16,090
people think is to change their tools so

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,800
we're talking about like getting DevOps

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:20,320
see our prize DevOps growing and

00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,060
replicating and sort of as an idea and

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,230
the way that we do our work a lot of

00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,210
people say DevOps is going to become

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,010
common sense well how do we actually get

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,990
that to happen if we think DevOps is the

00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:32,320
right way to go we might change the

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:34,270
tools the example he gives us a cell

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,560
phone right he says it takes about two

00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,670
years by the way any tool takes about

00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,050
two years to learn but how many people

00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,240
just kind of instinctively when they

00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:43,810
need to check the time now go for their

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,250
cell phone I do app I've actually seen

00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,930
friends who got the apple watch still do

00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,750
that and they're like all right I have

00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:52,660
to watch so I actually talked to a

00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:55,490
friend of mine who's getting his PhD in

00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:57,500
archaeology and talking about tools and

00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,670
artifacts and we're actually talking

00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,440
about over beer but he was saying

00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,780
artifacts are critical because they both

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,480
represent and build society they

00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,280
propagate it the way we trap cultural

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,110
human migration in a region is through

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,800
tools and artifacts so it's interesting

00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:16,940
to think about this in the context of of

00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:18,740
how trying to sort of propagate devops

00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,510
so we started with talking about the

00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,550
tension of scaling and and having it

00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,920
grow in different organizations and so

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,690
you know I really realized now that we

00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,030
sort of understand aesthetics we talked

00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:30,380
about sort of what we mean when I'm

00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,150
talking about a sex for the purpose of

00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,830
this presentation I kind of got it wrong

00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,300
it should have been really the art of

00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:38,630
DevOps it should actually really been

00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,620
the artifacts of DevOps right because

00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,750
those are the things that we can

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:47,630
actually look that our outcomes and

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:50,870
discuss so some artifacts of the DevOps

00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:52,100
movement dev ops team topologies what is

00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,140
the dev ops team look like

00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,970
infrastructure is code again that's an

00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,760
artifact obviously continuous delivery

00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:01,160
pipelines team incident response the

00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,750
crews interactions and conversations

00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,830
there's a multitude of others i'm not

00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,309
going to go through all of these in fact

00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:08,270
i'm only gonna go through three but one

00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:10,760
of the things is interesting to think

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:12,590
about is what other artifacts what might

00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,510
we put on this list of what other things

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,130
generally that we could actually are

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:18,590
concrete things we could discuss so

00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:21,080
let's just talk about three of them Kim

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,910
stop team topologies so these are

00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,380
various dev ops team topologies

00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:27,770
described by Matthew Skelton he's a

00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,690
consultant in England and so he kind of

00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:32,000
looked at like the different types of

00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:33,440
Davin ops teams that you kind of see and

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,760
that he had seen so we kind of graft

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,550
them out there's a blog post on this it

00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,050
has more context to run these photos but

00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,400
you can see obviously there's these are

00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,570
three and then they kind of go in I

00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,350
don't know what happens to typeset

00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:49,460
type-6 somebody else suggested type 7

00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:52,130
kwd end on twitter talks about the sre

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,660
team and the and how that is kind of may

00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,600
be different than dev and ops it's a

00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:00,920
totally different thing so if we go back

00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:04,550
and we look at our loose tax enemies but

00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:07,160
we look at them from the idea of dev ops

00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:09,750
team topologies we ask ourselves well

00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,310
from culture you know the topology

00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,570
going to either foster or discourage a

00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,970
certain type of interaction people have

00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,980
heard of maybe Conway's law this idea

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,330
that communication or the design of

00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,920
system follows the communication

00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,230
patterns we might see that based upon

00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,940
our team topology the tools obviously

00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,640
how do those teams communicate do they

00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,750
communicate with email slack do they

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,210
have custom tools just for doing

00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:32,600
handoffs maybe who knows it's

00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:36,750
interesting to think about complexity

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,130
what domain is our team topology and in

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,630
terms of complexity space I'm

00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,820
specifically sort of thinking about the

00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,350
canoe and framework which has a number

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,600
of different domains to describe how

00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:49,050
complex a particular thing is so what

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,970
what domain is our are different team

00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,920
topologies fit into more interestingly

00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,440
actually how would we transition from

00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,410
one topology to another it without very

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,610
doing a very jarring reorganization if

00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,040
we wanted to sort of manage the

00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:05,910
complexity how would we do that of

00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,650
course in a team dynamic situation

00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:10,440
complexity if you've heard modeled the

00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,820
channels of communication within a

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,380
network right if you've got people and

00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,960
how many paths and that goes well

00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:19,140
exponentially that's directly related to

00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,170
team topology so continuous delivery

00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:25,070
it's big with enterprises it's kind of

00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:27,150
interesting the DevOps Enterprise summit

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,410
most of the enterprise is there we're

00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,310
actually just talking about continuous

00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:32,310
delivery they didn't really actually

00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,540
talk all that much about DevOps that

00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,830
kind of said yeah DevOps and then they

00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,200
talked more about continuous delivery

00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:40,860
kind of interesting so again if we look

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,940
at this kind of model the interesting

00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,930
thing about continuous delivery one of

00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,760
the things that makes it really hard as

00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,800
it makes everything very visible and

00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,390
that affects our culture some some teams

00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,860
may not like the visibility that

00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,170
continuous delivery brings so that can

00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,910
be difficult rearranges some of the

00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,130
roles so sometimes people doing

00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:57,780
different roles that they used to do

00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,760
changes and that that could be jarring

00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,960
tools there's lots of fodder here a lot

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,300
of continuous delivery tools we could

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,070
talk about that for a whole talk

00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,830
complexity it's interesting to consider

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:09,810
whether continuous delivery actually

00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:12,600
tries to push things from the complex to

00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:14,550
the complicated to the obvious domains

00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,250
again those are kind of in framings of

00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,470
that problem but discontinuous delivery

00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,730
actually push our release process push

00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:24,450
domain of that it's kind of interesting

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:25,409
to consider and finally though when I

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,540
want to talk about with sort of

00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:29,490
interaction conversations and again I

00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:32,010
mean obviously there's a cultural impact

00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:36,540
there and I think it's important that we

00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:39,510
should look at that and actually a root

00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,149
can you put your phone down please yeah

00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:46,970
I need you put your phone down okay

00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:48,869
thanks now let's go back for a moment

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:53,490
who thought that was really

00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:57,210
uncomfortable yeah okay so what's

00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:58,859
interesting about that in talking about

00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,270
teams and our actions and the artifacts

00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:03,180
that we leave behind I just sort of left

00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:05,099
an artifact behind you probably have

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,109
maybe formed an opinion about our

00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,150
relationship and and maybe how I might

00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:12,960
treat people in an audience now what's

00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:14,849
interesting in a work context in a low

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,890
trust environment it would be easy say

00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:19,200
uh well Paul just being a jerk right

00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,369
maybe in a neutral trust environment

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,380
though and slightly different you might

00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:24,420
say these those two people are kind of

00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,550
that's weird interaction what's going on

00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,070
there now what is really interesting in

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:31,380
a high trust environment you might go

00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,820
well that's really odd both of those

00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,500
people's behavior that's out of

00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,510
character for them I wonder what's going

00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,030
on and there's kind of two different

00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:42,420
context context to parse what I asked a

00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,190
route to do one is I want you to put

00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,170
your phone down because the website is

00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,820
blowing up and I know you're the person

00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,710
that can help me with that so I need

00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,359
your help with that might be one context

00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,680
I'll give you another context was pretty

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,470
interesting i was having i was working

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,359
with the team and we were in a meeting

00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:59,220
and we had a no cell phones rule sort of

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,320
in our meetings and one of the guys

00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,030
great engineer a high trust environment

00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,589
had his phone out and kept buzzing and

00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,810
he kept kind of looking at it wasn't

00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:08,820
really involved in the meeting and we

00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:10,830
had that interaction and he said you

00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,900
know can we just talk talk about later

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,609
so i said okay fine and after the

00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,130
meeting I found out that the night

00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:19,920
before his wife had a miscarriage so do

00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:22,800
you think he was there president of mine

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,150
at work at that meeting probably not we

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,170
actually discussed that he went home for

00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,660
the rest of the day after that meeting

00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:30,150
because that was more important but that

00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,950
is certainly if all of the the only

00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:35,730
artifact you see is that interaction

00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:39,990
the context suddenly becomes very

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:42,180
important context is key by the way I

00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,020
know a roof I asked if I could yell at

00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,080
him so let's give him a round of

00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:50,310
applause for letting me yell at him in

00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:52,380
the presentation so all right okay let's

00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:55,230
loosen back up all right so a friend of

00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,670
mine Justin the archaeologist is a

00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:58,830
running joke among archaeologists

00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,240
archaeologist is when we don't know what

00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,370
something is we just call it ritual

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,510
right it's religious a religious

00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:05,040
artifact there been a number of cases

00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,930
where they thought was a religious and

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,880
it turned out to be like cooking stones

00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:12,000
like to keep the pot warm and stuff like

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,320
that so that's kind of what funny all

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,630
right so devops aesthetics tools culture

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,850
and artifacts oh my we talked about all

00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,550
of these today and you might be going

00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,600
well so this is all kind of interesting

00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,600
maybe I learned a little bit about

00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,090
complexity what am I supposed to do with

00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,740
all of this and I was talking with the

00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:35,280
organizers and we're talking about the

00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:37,080
fact that it's important to have a

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,220
takeaway they wanted a concrete take

00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,440
away because it's fun to talk about

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,730
culture and and aesthetics and what

00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,850
looks pretty but it's not very

00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,590
actionable other than maybe having a

00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:49,710
conversation so these are the takeaways

00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:52,980
that I have for you don't avoid the

00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:54,510
elephants don't avoid those elephant

00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,600
conversations that I was talking about

00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,920
especially as they refer or relate to

00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,190
shared aesthetics that's really

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,840
important slow down to actually notice

00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,010
what might be an aesthetic conversation

00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,300
because these conversations since that

00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,310
weren't like we're talking about does

00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,620
your code look prettier than my code

00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:13,160
it's really should we use cmq or

00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:15,570
RabbitMQ right or you know whatever

00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,690
there's aesthetics behind those

00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,640
conversations this is one of my favorite

00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,980
John alspaugh from NC John Ross boats oh

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,510
that's just semantics dismissively said

00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,800
by everyone who thinks words language

00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:30,150
and meaning don't matter they do in some

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,160
sense I think he's referring to this

00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:35,580
idea of the sort of aesthetics that

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,020
we've been talking about so pay

00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,640
attention to your artifacts I think

00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,440
takeaway number to pay attention to your

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,050
artifacts so understand the artifacts

00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,780
that you produce and that you contribute

00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,720
to producing and a lot of times we r

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,430
came through life producing artifacts

00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,620
example I gave you of the way I treated

00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:54,750
someone on maybe my team the great

00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:58,080
example of an artifact that accretes

00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:00,150
over time and we're often sort of not

00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,550
aware of it because we we sort of do

00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,140
that and you have to look at those

00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:07,170
artifacts through this lens of a shared

00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:09,300
aesthetic so does it contribute to the

00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:11,190
group aesthetic does it detract from the

00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,470
group's aesthetic and by the way that

00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,420
might be okay what you're working on it

00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:17,490
might be okay that it detracts from the

00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,050
shared aesthetic of the group but it

00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,370
also might explain why it's not taking

00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:22,530
any rights you're not getting any

00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,790
traction with that particular artifact

00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:25,800
does anyone tried to roll out a tool and

00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,310
everyone's like yeah I don't care right

00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,170
that's that kind of effect going on

00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:32,850
maybe it's an entirely new aesthetic so

00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,560
think about that if it's a new aesthetic

00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,510
that you're trying to introduce the way

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,850
that you go through doing that again

00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:42,300
Snowden talking about tools it's going

00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:44,250
to take a long time two years and you

00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,820
might introduce that to your team's a

00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:51,420
little differently and finally keep

00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:53,760
context front of mind as we saw it it's

00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,690
really important you have to pay

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,360
attention to context and more

00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:59,970
importantly your team's degree of

00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,830
context around the artifact the great

00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,840
example of taking tools from netflix and

00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,040
they don't trying to shoehorn them into

00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,720
our vironment it doesn't quite work

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,140
right right that's because there's

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,570
slightly different aesthetics there in

00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:14,550
this particular case talking about the

00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,380
unicorns and you can come companies

00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:19,200
isn't particularly useful if you're not

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,600
Batman with an army of dolphins right so

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,450
if you were to talk about the unicorns

00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:28,170
may not actually make sense and finally

00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:30,510
whatever this process of looking at the

00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,850
artifacts that you've created thinking

00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,650
about the aesthetics and evaluating them

00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:37,590
whatever that process is for you and

00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:43,070
your team make time to appreciate the

00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:43,070
beauty and things done well thanks

00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,620
