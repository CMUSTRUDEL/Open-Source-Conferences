so lonely I am you are from weeks

00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,369
architected weeks I'm going to give you

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,880
a small introduction to what we're doing

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:22,909
and basically weeks is a tool to build

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,820
websites and which allows a person to

00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:28,460
work inside the browser open a

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,649
powerpoint like interface and author is

00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,920
website and publish the website directly

00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:35,900
from the browser you can also add

00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,750
components onto those websites like

00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,270
e-commerce chat different applications

00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,180
we have an SDK that you can extend weeks

00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:48,020
and add more types of applications into

00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,960
it you just give a short view that's the

00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,480
way that our editor tools looks like and

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,330
that tool that is in the browser a

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,220
website will look like any professional

00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,410
website it doesn't look like anything

00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,630
built with the template or certain

00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,960
design can grow and make any design to

00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:08,990
12 2x and just give some sense about the

00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:13,100
numbers tweaks the company is about

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:18,560
seven years old we have over 39 million

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:21,080
websites built on Wix over a million new

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,430
website in new users every month any

00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:28,220
overt 150 kids olive oil I think we're

00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:33,740
already at above 200 terabytes of media

00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:36,080
files over trend servers in over 100

00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:39,260
million API calls into our data centers

00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,470
every day and that is not count in media

00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:46,610
that goes to our CDN so there's quite a

00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:49,340
lot going on there II and when can come

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,940
it back to develop days regarding DevOps

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:56,270
and weeks from our point of view we have

00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:59,030
a strategic a target for to do

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,200
continuous delivering and when it's an

00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:04,159
could use deliver I'm talking about a

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,060
very broad sense from a product idea all

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,369
the way to have a product working with

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,540
hundreds of thousands users and want to

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:16,689
minimize the time to do it

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,920
and as part of that target we're doing

00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:23,890
DevOps and DevOps for us is one of the

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,090
enabler stinger to do that and that when

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:33,459
I'm saying that it is a strategic goal

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:34,989
when the CEO of weeks add a requirement

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:40,090
i want continues to level eight weeks

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:42,459
and so we other keywords like a TDD or

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,129
DevOps of things that are inside aren t

00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:50,590
this some districts level of the company

00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:53,200
and our needs of the one people the way

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,870
we have restructured our organization

00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:01,030
and restructured our a way of thinking

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:04,120
in a more diverse way in the focus of

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:07,180
our day off our ops team or dev ops team

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,579
is more about building the tools and

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,909
building the enablers it's more about

00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:14,319
doing the ongoing operations like

00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:17,940
deciding which data center gets the

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,959
traffic moving billion data centers

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,419
guiding developers and helping

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:26,500
developers to create the tools and in

00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:28,209
all of the infrastructure they need the

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,620
guys that actually do the deployments

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,989
are the developers and they are

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,290
responsible for the deployments they are

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:38,829
responsible for their products and for

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:41,260
their services and out guys that will

00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:46,709
fix problems even if that's in 3m good

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:52,479
morning and just give it a small

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:54,879
anecdote about cultural change we are

00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,340
today that cultural change is something

00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,099
that is very difficult to do what we

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,599
found that say the best tool well

00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:06,129
actually the tool toward for us to do a

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:09,840
cultural change was a television when we

00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:15,180
placed a TV a television or a monitor

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:18,009
inside the dev room and guys there

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,409
opened our monitor tool and edit in

00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:23,590
front of them all the time on their

00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:27,430
screen the net result was that between

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:29,490
two weeks later that service work twice

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,530
fast another week later it works another

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,660
twice as fast so got four times faster

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,150
just been three weeks just replace an

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,600
ATV and the number of sales failure

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,759
still was reduced very fast and so what

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,080
adjust just by exploring data developers

00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:50,880
and so that is a one way we're doing

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:55,090
were change culture of the company and I

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,770
guess now we're going for a break so

00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,770
