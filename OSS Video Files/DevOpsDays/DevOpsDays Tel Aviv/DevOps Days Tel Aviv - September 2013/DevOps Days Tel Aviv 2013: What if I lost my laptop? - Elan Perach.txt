Playlist: DevOps Days Tel Aviv - September 2013
Description: 
	A short presentation of the enormous risk the information on a devop's devices (laptop/mobile) can have for the organization. From the various ssh keys, saved passwords, bash history and up to gmail being open on the mobile phone. This talk will focus on the potential harm bad security can cause, and provide some tips on how to keep your environment safe and minimize catastrophic risk.

okay so I'm you lon and I'm gonna be

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,220
talking to you about laptop security it

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,020
started so basically thinking of how to

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,570
secure the data on our laptop and what

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,609
happens if we lose it or get stolen so

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,529
it all started a couple weeks ago when I

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,179
woke up and I couldn't find my laptop

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,399
and then I started running through my

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,410
head all the different scenarios of how

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,110
much money I'd lose and all my clients

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,750
dad on my laptop and all crazy things

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,239
that happen if I can't find it so a

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,010
little background about myself I work at

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,020
five hundred tech which is a ruby on

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,879
rails web development company and we

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,649
have lots of data of our clients that

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,500
are very important that if we lose we're

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,870
in big big trouble so it happened a

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,109
couple weeks ago I woke up couldn't find

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,539
my laptop looking for it and as I said

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:09,150
going through all the crazy scenarios if

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:12,360
I couldn't find it so I'm gonna go over

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,640
all the things to think about so first

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,320
thing i thought i needed mine a laptop

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,049
and as a developer we like the cutting

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,900
edge if it's a 16 gig of ram and SSD

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:26,450
hard drive easily a thousand six hundred

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,670
dollars then the second thing is

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,100
installing all of my configurations

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,840
installing linux on it getting up to

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,030
speed with all my clients projects

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,470
another day's work to least a thousand

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,590
dollars were up to two thousand six

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,259
hundred dollars losing the laptop then i

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,869
remembered that i didn't commit all of

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,380
my code that i've been writing through

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,909
during the last couple of days so now i

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,070
have to rewrite everything let's say two

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,329
days work another two thousand dollars

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,340
we're at four thousand six hundred

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,799
dollars and that's before even thinking

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,560
of all the delicate data of my clients

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,930
that if someone gets to what happens so

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,460
did I use an encrypted file system if

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,439
someone gets a hold of my laptop they

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,080
can plug it into another screen see all

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,880
the data who knows how much money that's

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,250
worth to my client

00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:21,030
um next thing did I put passwords on all

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:24,510
my ssh keys to Amazon bitbucket the

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,850
github Roku if not they can just if it's

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,610
a smart hacker I gotta control my laptop

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,400
and they can rewrite code push it do

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,610
whatever they want with my clients

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,380
projects do I use chrome passwords to

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,420
save my passwords if so they just login

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,760
they just open the computer login to

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:47,820
paypal and transfer all the money over

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,650
from paypal and then after looking all

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,230
around my house I realize it was right

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,630
there under my bed and nothing happens

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,860
and I decided to do a little overview of

00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,720
all the precautions any person should do

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:04,500
in order not to have this nightmare

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,990
happen for real so I went through I made

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,830
a list of precautions for you so none of

00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:21,000
this ever happens to me or anyone else

00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:23,220
so first thing funny don't leave any

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,650
untouched commits always make sure to

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,450
make small commits push to github

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,330
bitbucket whatever you do regularly and

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,310
if using a Mac you have got time machine

00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,950
so if someone does if you do lose your

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,210
laptop then you can always restore all

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,410
your data very easily of course put a

00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:44,520
password on your computer and have it

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,200
lock automatically so even though

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,700
someone doesn't want to if they'll have

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,200
access to it maybe they'll go find

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,940
something sensitive and user and be and

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,730
have that password work with an

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,430
encryption file system so if someone

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,320
gets ahold of your hard drive they can't

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,550
just read all the data right from it

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:09,930
because it's all encrypted and they need

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:11,640
your password to read it um make an idea

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,310
I came up with like after this happen is

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,320
to have a dedicated email for signing up

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:21,479
for websites or like PayPal stuff so if

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,860
they you do leave your email open they

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,979
can't just recreate your passwords

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,569
and you'll have a dedicated email for

00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:30,969
important stuff of course putting

00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:33,370
passwords on all your SSH keys for

00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:35,139
production servers and development you

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,479
can work without it but in order to push

00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:42,580
to the production it's important to have

00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:45,039
a password whoever uses LastPass I like

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,530
it very much you can save all your

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,270
passwords in the cloud and you only need

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,520
to remember one password and with one

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,870
single action you can change all the

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,949
passwords for all your important

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:59,770
websites if you do use Chrome passwords

00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:02,919
you can go to chrome dome settings

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,199
chrome sync and change your chrome

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,120
password and if they're got access to

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,639
your browser then it all changed and

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,889
they can't log in to your important data

00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,740
following these this whole incident I

00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,569
also learned about a SAS product called

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,340
encrypted cloud which will allows you to

00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:26,199
encrypt files and Google Drive and

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,650
Dropbox all kinds of services you use

00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,569
that you have sensitive data in the club

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,009
so I hope nothing from all this ever

00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:35,949
happens to you and you take the

00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:39,270
necessary precautions and safe DevOps

00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,270
