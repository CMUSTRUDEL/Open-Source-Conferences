Title: DevOps Days Tel Aviv 2013: The DevOps field guide to cognitive biases - Lindsay Holmwood
Publication date: 2013-10-24
Playlist: DevOps Days Tel Aviv - September 2013
Description: 
	As devops practitioners we focus on improving the culture of collaboration so that others play nicely with us & we play nicely with others - but what if the biggest thing holding us back from change is our own brains?

Cognitive biases can deeply affect our behaviours towards others by herding us towards mental shortcuts that are optimised for timeliness over accuracy, at the expense of rationalising irrational behaviour.

You are probably pushing these biases onto other people every day but don't even know it. Does that idea make you feel unconfortable? You are probably experiencing the Semmelweis reflex kicking your confirmation bias right now.

Knowing is half the battle. This talk will delve into some of the well-known and less well-known biases that may be affecting your ability to work with your peers, and your team's ability to work constructively with other teams.

Attendees will leave the talk with an overview of biases they run into every day, how to hack their brains to use these biases to their advantage, and some tips on how to mitigate the effects of the limitations baked into their wetware.

We have met the enemy and he is us.

alright mmm good morning everyone so I'm

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,170
going to start out this talk with

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,380
perhaps a little experience that you've

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,750
all sort of had so this like a new

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,779
iphone that comes out and it's you know

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,160
shiny and amazing and looks awesome or

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,500
you know maybe it's an android device or

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,719
something like that and you start

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,520
noticing that your current iphone is

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,320
crashing a lot more than what it

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,809
normally does it just seems to be really

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,579
really unstable it's just getting slower

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,010
it's more and more difficult to use and

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,230
you know that the prospect of upgrading

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,700
is looking you to the latest device is

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,110
looking quite tempting so why are we

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,270
doing this well obviously it's because

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,610
Apple has induced planned obsolescence

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,859
in our phones right there running slower

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,000
now because they put out a new piece of

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,649
hardware and your shiny piece of

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,739
hardware and they're trying to get us

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,330
all to upgrade at once so it turns out

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,340
that this is actually a thing called a

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,390
cognitive bias known as the clustering

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,430
illusion so your brain is constantly

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,710
analyzing new information and it's

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,180
actually finding patterns in randomness

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,330
part of the reason that you're alive

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,490
today but with the frequency illusion

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,080
you actually tend to see correlations

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,509
where there aren't actually any

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,340
correlations whatsoever sort of like if

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,479
you buy a new car and then suddenly when

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,950
you're out driving on the road and that

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,259
new car you think that's Hank are

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,840
absolutely everywhere sort of validating

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,460
your own choice turns out that your

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,390
device has actually always been that

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,340
slow um and yeah you just sort of only

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,740
really noticing it now and this is this

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,000
is a cognitive bias so yeah hi everyone

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,610
my name is Lindsey home would I mock

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,689
ceases here on Twitter I'm a research

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,000
and development manager at a

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,820
sydney-based cloud hosting company

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,530
called bulletproof networks so I

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,270
actually although I work for a

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,460
sydney-based company I actually manage a

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,219
team of distributed infrastructure

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,009
engineers and I live in an area called

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,810
the Blue Mountains which i guess is sort

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,200
of like no John sort of refers to it as

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,580
the Grand Canyon which frees

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,650
so I've been involved in the DevOps

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,810
stuff for a while I've co-organized the

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,670
Sydney DevOps me that was the last four

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,900
years and actually started DevOps down

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,849
under as well which is sort of like a

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,730
another version Australian version of

00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:29,010
this same conference and I've got a done

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,300
a bunch of different open-source things

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,470
in the last few years as well we come

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:38,220
chat to me about that afterwards if

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:39,720
you're interested so what is a cognitive

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,760
bias I mentioned what it was you know

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,489
that there are cognitive biases but what

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,450
is actually happening here so all the

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:51,269
cognitive biases is a mental shortcut so

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:54,049
your brain is constantly optimizing for

00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:56,940
oops it's constantly optimizing for

00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:59,430
timeliness over accuracy it cares about

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,080
coming to a result quickly it doesn't

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,010
necessarily care whether that result

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,720
that it's come to is correct so the way

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,040
that works something like this your

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,980
brain is doing some sort of problem

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,410
solving it's using a heuristic is doing

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,840
some sort of pattern matching and if it

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,810
comes to a correct result then we say

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,489
that this is a rational choice pretty

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,730
simple and straightforward but then if

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,590
your brain is doing more problem solving

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,670
its using another set of heuristics or

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,069
maybe it's exactly the same set of

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,260
heuristics and it results in an

00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,299
incorrect result then we say that this

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,910
is a cognitive bias that's all it is

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,730
very simple very straightforward and

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,920
what is a heuristic in a psychological

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,209
context but like I said it's all really

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,709
about pattern matching it's about

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,200
pattern matching it's about using

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,930
existing judgments and experiences to

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,420
rate new experiences and categorize new

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,590
information that's coming in most

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,420
important thing is that it's actually

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,560
what helped your ancestors survived it's

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,989
the reason that you're here today so I

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,190
want you to imagine another scenario so

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,109
you've what you've woken up in the

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,959
morning um maybe a little bit earlier

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,970
than this and you know you're going

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,100
through normal sort of breakfast routine

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,829
before going off to work so maybe put

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,209
some eggs onto the boil and you've made

00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:16,739
some toys as well and you put it all

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,630
down on the table and you sit down and

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,120
you're um you're about to tuck into it

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,470
you you do a little bit a little bit of

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,950
cracked pepper on top you can put a

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,670
little bit of salt as well

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:29,620
and as you're as you're about to go for

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,240
the salt you actually your phone goes

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,950
off you get a little notification so you

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,660
know being a being a good little

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,820
internet addict that you are you sort of

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,500
reach over for it to have a look at the

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,730
latest message and you accidentally

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,020
knock the salt shaker off the table and

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,910
out of the corner of your eye you see

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,100
that yeah I think it sort of went over

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,780
here so you know you start looking over

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,820
there and you're focusing and you zoom

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,460
in and you're you know pulling the bags

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,780
away and the shoes and the trash bin and

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,510
opening up all the drawers and I just

00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,740
can't find that damn salt shaker you

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,750
know you look 45 minutes and your

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,130
exasperated you just you can't work out

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,720
where it's going on us it's almost like

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,020
a black hole has opened up and it just

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,220
disappeared into it then you take a step

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,440
back and you find that the soul shaker

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,740
was actually over there all along was

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,270
actually underneath the chair so this is

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,710
this is a prime example of a thing

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,790
called the confirmation bias which is

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,760
one of the one of the most well-known

00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,590
cognitive biases so your brain is

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,900
constantly seeking information that it

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,570
reinforces in existing position it has

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,940
an idea made up about what the situation

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,060
is and it's finding other information to

00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,680
back that on your also ignoring

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,540
alternative explanation that's why you

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,830
were focused for five minutes i'm trying

00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,190
to find the soul shaker underneath the

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,990
cupboard and even worse your brain is

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:49,150
actually interpreting ambiguous

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,500
information towards towards reinforcing

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:55,030
the position you've actually already

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:58,150
taken up so who he knows this guy

00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:01,690
stephen colbert quick show of hands

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:03,550
people familiar okay right so Stephen

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,520
Colbert sort of interesting he's an

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,870
American comedian who has a persona and

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:13,090
runs a late-night TV show and called The

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,920
Colbert Report and I he sort of has this

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,230
persona that is also named Stephen

00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,740
Colbert but basically is a sort of like

00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:24,150
doing a send-up of a American sort of

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,140
conservative political pundit and

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,060
liberals absolutely love him because

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:31,210
he's he's lamp pruning that sort of

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,580
traditional conservative political

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,020
operative you know very much standing up

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,409
the sort of behavior you see on Fox News

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,229
things like that

00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:40,489
but it also turns out that there are a

00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,559
lot of conservatives that absolutely

00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:44,419
love them as well and that leads to

00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:46,309
interesting article headlines like this

00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:49,819
you know who is clueless enough to think

00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:51,080
that Colbert is a conservative and

00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,699
that's because the people that are

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,309
watching it that already come to the

00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,979
table with with you know a conservative

00:06:55,309 --> 00:07:00,469
background looking at the information

00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:02,330
that he is delivering to them and it

00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:04,339
reinforces their existing positions so

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,339
the absolute love him CEO from their

00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:09,879
perspective they they see him as

00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:14,360
lampooning the the liberal establishment

00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:17,989
oops so what I want you to do is watch

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,439
how many times the team in white passes

00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:20,439
that ball

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:38,940
all right quick shout out how many times

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,890
do you think you saw it passed okay so

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,590
somewhere between like 13 13 to 15

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,870
something like that okay so did you

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:49,830
notice the moonwalking gorilla in the

00:07:45,870 --> 00:08:02,790
center as well okay all right watch that

00:07:49,830 --> 00:08:04,670
again in case you didn't see it oops so

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,810
this is the confirmation bias in action

00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,730
you're looking for a particular pattern

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:12,990
and you're ignoring other information

00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:14,460
that doesn't fit that pattern and you

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,130
probably experienced this window buggin

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,780
code as well in the past so you know

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,360
you're you're you're writing on your

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,060
writing in your application and you

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,890
found a bug but you know that your your

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,370
code is perfect it can't possibly be a

00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:31,230
bug in my own code and it has to be some

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,080
sort of bug in the library that i'm

00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,700
using underneath so i just can't find it

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,460
though and i just need to try harder and

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,530
look deeper so I like dig and I dig in a

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,360
dig and then 30 minutes passed and it

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,840
turns out that the bug was in my code or

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,430
one so that initial judgment that

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,980
initial argument that your brain come up

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,440
with you are reinforcing that that

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,700
entire time and it wasn't until you took

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,100
a step back that you were able to work

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,280
out that hey actually my original

00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,450
assertion was actually incorrect so

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,700
there are some pretty simple things that

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,830
you can do to counter this behavior the

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,540
first thing is in in the context of

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,490
having arguments and discussions about

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,990
me other things like architecture or the

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,720
best way forward to achieve a particular

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,910
goal you have people to take opposing

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,200
viewpoints you know sort of playing the

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,840
devil's advocate for the sake of

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,280
argument and the reason that's important

00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,100
is that it actually encourages people

00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,530
who have a particular argument to be

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,720
more I guess make their at their

00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,660
argument a little bit more robust and

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,090
you and consider the viewpoint

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,260
alternative viewpoints to their own the

00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,660
other interesting thing as well is that

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,110
if you come to a conclusion in your work

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,960
life that is negative you know you're

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,430
making a judgment call on somebody else

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,390
it's very possible that that could be a

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,590
bias judgment

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:50,910
as well a really simple way to harness

00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,610
that behavior as well as if you already

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,280
have a good collaborative culture within

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,200
your organization it can mean that if

00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,940
somebody makes a mistake and screw

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,400
somebody else over on another team that

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,540
you know you may be able to maybe more

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,010
willing to give them a free pass because

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,450
hey you know you know that they're

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,470
actually doing they're trying to do the

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,950
right thing even though they're just

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,620
screwed me over so a really simple way

00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,880
to remember this is confirmation

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,570
reinforces while you ignore other

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,870
sources all right I want to give you

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,270
another example so this is a sort of a

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,860
personal story from my work life so like

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,160
i said before i run a distributor team

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,720
of info coders and one of the

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,790
responsibilities of my team is to work

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,200
on provisioning automation for within

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,990
our business on multiple hosting

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,280
platforms so i want to tell you about a

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:43,500
story that took us 18 months to deliver

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,000
provisioning automation on top of vmware

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,840
18 months sounds like a hell of a long

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,460
time doesn't it hmm so we have a

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,680
dedicated provisioning team within the

00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,660
company and the prov team say hey we're

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,090
being hurt really badly by these VMware

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,890
probes so my team comes along and says

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,810
hey will totally automate that for you

00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,240
so we go off when we work on that for a

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,100
little bit and then you know two weeks

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,830
later we've made a bit of progress on

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,150
that and the prov 10 go back to us and

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,400
say hey you know we're being really hurt

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,470
by this load balancer stuff now we need

00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,000
to make that work better and we're like

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,020
okay we're totally on there will get on

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,850
there right now and make that better

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,470
silly you know we come off the vmware

00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,290
provisioning automation we start working

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,880
on the load balancer another week goes

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,890
by we have another one of these catch up

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,390
meetings like hey that vmware stuff is

00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:33,600
really hurting us again okay we'll just

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,860
switch on to that for weeks later oh no

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,480
it's something completely different

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,510
something that we haven't experienced

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,550
yet you're automating the the ec2 probes

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,200
are taken for it we're just doing the

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,790
probes in general is taking forever so

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,180
you know we're going to get right on

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:52,350
automating that as well so we engage in

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:54,150
this sort of behavior for 18 months that

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,510
sounds sort of inefficient doesn't it

00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,040
when you look at it in those terms so

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,660
can anyone tell me here

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:12,959
what's actually happening behind the

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:14,519
scenes any guesses go no goals yep we're

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,680
totally aiming on improving the

00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:25,980
provisioning automation though that's

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:27,660
the goal sure yep very good so when we

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,610
saw one problem the next the next

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,130
problem comes on and you know had a bit

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,690
of a promotion there so the actual thing

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,850
that's happening here is that we are

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,860
working on the thing closest to us that

00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,920
is hurting us the moist at this point in

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,360
time and we probably all experienced

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,519
this in one form or another right in our

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,769
professional lives constantly constants

00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,880
with context switching between different

00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:49,829
projects because this is the thing

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,740
that's most important right now the sort

00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:53,910
of shifting sands of priority but it

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,649
turns out that all those little problems

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,630
that you're jumping between aren't the

00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,800
biggest problems overall because you

00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,940
don't have a bigger picture you don't

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,510
know you don't know what those goals are

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:10,380
right so interesting question would you

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:12,750
work like this yep cool right so if you

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,769
were to say no you would be engaging

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,519
anything called the hindsight bias so I

00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:22,110
constructed the story in this particular

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,149
way by explaining to the outcome of this

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,529
18 months of work not actually talking

00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:26,790
about it at the very beginning and the

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,519
goal that we were trying to deal with on

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,589
a daily basis hindsight bias is also

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,170
known as the knew it all along effect

00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:38,190
it's actually type of memory distortion

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:39,779
where you basically see events by and

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,550
you know you know the judgment from the

00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:45,240
outset so then you interpret the events

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,189
that led up to that as being bad as sort

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,050
of reinforcing the reason that you

00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:52,050
actually go to that that particular bad

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:55,620
outcome so you see this all the time

00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:58,319
when the media talks about airplane

00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,880
crashes so there's the Asiana 214 flight

00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:03,209
the crash in san francisco earlier this

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,980
year you know within you know within 24

00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:07,110
hours there are newspaper articles with

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,939
headlines like this you know the Asiana

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,420
pilot was in training they were

00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:14,700
inexperienced they stayed silent

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,800
they were negligent right and this is

00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,970
very pervasive in our culture of the way

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,610
that we the way that we talk about

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,709
failure in the way that we model in and

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,709
all this comes down to as a judgment

00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:28,110
right it's about pushing away

00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:30,589
undesirable behavior and saying that

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,579
that's somebody else's responsibility

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:34,529
and you're saying that that particular

00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:37,560
person or that group of people were

00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:39,420
capable of preventing a bad outcome if

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,560
only they'd known what their actions

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,660
were going to result in so another great

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,519
example of this on a day to day basis if

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,529
you come from an OPS background is

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,959
tweaking the monitoring threshold threat

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,370
so you know you get woken up in the

00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,500
middle of the night three and buy some

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,269
page and you get into work the next day

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,720
and you're like I never want to be

00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:04,050
notified by about that thing again at 3m

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,310
in the morning so I'm gonna make that

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:09,389
problem go away i'm going to give up

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:10,920
that problem away but interesting

00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:13,260
question how often does that alert

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,389
actually file is that the first time

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,339
that is ever actually flying is if I

00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:20,910
every single time you're on an on-call

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:23,269
shift what percentage of all alerts is

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:26,220
that is it worth spending the time

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:29,490
focusing on making that one alert go

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:34,230
away at 3am are there other alerts that

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:36,029
are actually firing more frequently what

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:39,990
makes that alert the most important to

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:41,279
fix is the fundamental question so a

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,399
really simple way to counter that

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,800
behavior is by collecting data analyzing

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,899
that data and making decisions based on

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,160
that data also known as the scientific

00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:55,050
method it's pretty damn useful and this

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,670
is all about acting on data rather than

00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:00,569
on feelings you know stories a very

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:02,730
powerful tool for your communicating

00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:06,120
your unhappiness and your frustration

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,649
with other people and your for just you

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,389
know making your point like I'm doing

00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:11,850
you right now but it turns out of the

00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:13,440
data on the whole tends to not lie all

00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,470
that much even if it is a little bit of

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,060
an abstraction the other interesting

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,949
thing as well when you're talking about

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,720
some sort of failure scenario some sort

00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:23,590
of thing that you know some horrible

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,990
travesty some catastrophe

00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,000
happen on your IT infrastructure is to

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,490
actually explain the thing that went

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,830
wrong in terms of foresight rather than

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,910
hindsight so there was a there was a

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,130
study that was done a couple of years

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:40,840
ago and they looked at the conviction

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:43,630
rate of prosecutors versus defenders in

00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,900
the legal system and basically for

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:49,210
prosecutors that framed frame their

00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:52,240
argument in terms of hindsight looking

00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:55,270
at the outcome of some bad action some

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,940
apparently bad action they actually had

00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,490
high conviction rate because people were

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,960
more easily swayed to that position

00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,030
whereas the defenders if they talked

00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,880
about and then you know for the defense

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:09,520
in terms of full side you know

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,040
explaining the rationalization behind

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,150
that person each each and every step

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,220
leading up to the bad thing that

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,880
happened they actually had a high chance

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,560
of getting the person off it's a really

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,350
simple way to remember this is the

00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:27,730
foresight blinds sorry hindsight blinds

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:30,250
and foresight fines okay so another

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,560
little scenario for you you know you've

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,930
got your you got your boss and he's you

00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,550
know very nice shirt and tie and he's

00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,790
just had a wonderful meeting with the

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,140
marketing guys all morning and it's just

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,090
after lunch and you sort of come back

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,700
and you know you've finished eating and

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,080
maybe feeling a little bit a little bit

00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,960
woozy a little bit you know it's time

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,090
for your afternoon siesta and it turns

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,670
out that your bosses actually promised

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:57,310
these amazing things to the marketing

00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,780
department without involving you at all

00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,720
right like totally the antithesis of

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,280
DevOps and yeah by the way there's an

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,690
impossible deadline is attached to this

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,220
you know we needed we need to deliver

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,310
the world and we need to do it in you

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,440
know three weeks from now probably few

00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,610
people are sort of having terrible

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,190
flashbacks right now when they're

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:17,860
thinking about the scenario and you're

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,750
like why why would you do this like this

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,120
is just insane why would you commit us

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,860
to this and your boss says I don't know

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,790
what you're complaining about it's just

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,790
a bunch of typing

00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:31,679
so this is another cognitive bias called

00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,700
the dunning-kruger effect and the

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,610
dunning-kruger effect is actually

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,919
multifaceted there's a lot of really

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,330
interesting research it's going on about

00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,730
the Dane Krueger effect at the moment as

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,600
only discovered about 15 years ago but

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,990
you know there's a huge amount of

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,759
activity around that so the less do you

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:52,210
know about a topic the better you

00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:56,740
actually think that you are at it what

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:58,330
that one's sink in for a second the less

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,179
you know about a topic the poorer your

00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:06,100
ability is to recognize genuine skill in

00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:08,970
other people and the more you know about

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:13,539
a topic the worst you think you're at it

00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:15,549
that's a little bit terrifying and why

00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:18,399
is this what's actually pretty simple if

00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:20,950
you have more skill in particular topic

00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,929
area or a subject matter it means that

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:26,679
you put in more practice which means

00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:28,210
that you have more experience which

00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,879
means that you see complexity and nuance

00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:34,769
that people who don't have that

00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:37,029
experience unable to see themselves and

00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:38,649
this is another little thing a little

00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:41,399
axiom called the curse of knowledge you

00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:43,809
know if you if you know a subject matter

00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:46,119
deeply intricately you know all the ins

00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:47,980
and outs of it sometimes it can be

00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,509
impossible to actually make some sort of

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,240
rational decision about that some

00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:54,039
rationalize decision about that because

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,240
you know that whatever decision you make

00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,769
there's going to be some sort of

00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,039
negative trade-off and we're always

00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:03,940
optimizing for you know for completely

00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:07,059
positive outcomes so in the case where

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,279
you're someone with less skill it means

00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:11,889
that you've done less practice means you

00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,539
have less experience therefore you've

00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:16,600
actually probably never had any sort of

00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:18,369
peer feedback at all you haven't been

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:23,409
able to rate your ability against other

00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:25,210
people in your cohort and to make this

00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:26,769
even worse the poor performance because

00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,779
they believe that they're actually quite

00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:30,909
good at it even though they're not they

00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:34,230
don't actually learn from any feedback

00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:34,230
suggesting that they need to improve

00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:47,039
right can write going better than any of

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:50,460
our developers I can scale our systems

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:53,070
way better than houses admins my boss

00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:57,679
doesn't know what he's doing I can lead

00:20:53,070 --> 00:21:00,929
people way better than him no you can't

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,799
maybe you can but if that's the case

00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:04,620
that you're probably in the wrong job

00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,360
why aren't you doing the job you are no

00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,760
ID unique snowflake is really what this

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,830
all comes down to and I think this graph

00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:19,650
is well quite adequately describes the

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:21,030
phenomena as well all right really

00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,470
simple ways to counter this behavior is

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,690
one of the great things actually about

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,890
why you about all the research is

00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:29,909
happening around dunning-kruger at the

00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:31,620
moment so firstly become more skilled in

00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:33,510
the thing that you are unskilled at it

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,370
sounds stupid when I say it like that

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:38,820
but it's it's actually massively

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,809
effective so it turns out through a

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,549
bunch of different studies that have

00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:43,820
been conducted on this that minimal

00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:47,309
training in a particular subject area

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:50,820
actually improves your ability to self

00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:51,960
assess your own ability in that which i

00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,970
think is pretty much DevOps in a

00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,470
nutshell right and the interesting thing

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,179
about that is that you have an improved

00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,370
self assessment regardless of whether

00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,620
you actually improve your skill itself

00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:04,650
so you can do the training in this thing

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,200
and not actually get any better at it

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,179
but you become better at identifying

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,330
genuine skill and other people that's

00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,470
sort of interesting are another really

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,679
simple thing make your engineers

00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:18,299
managers if they want to do that you

00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,309
know they have they have an idea or they

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:22,730
have an understanding about the things

00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:24,960
that the people in their team are doing

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,309
and then you've got non-technical

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,010
managers as well so if you're a non

00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:30,929
technical manager lean on your engineers

00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,580
actually understand what they're dealing

00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:33,809
with on a daily basis that's not to say

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,830
that you should be writing code and

00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:36,419
deploying into production although

00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,250
that's you know that's a pretty noble

00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,960
goal as well but at least having an

00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,460
understanding about what they're doing

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,880
is pretty damn important to doing a job

00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,620
best you possibly can do the other

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,630
interesting effect here is ethnic

00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,630
diversity so it turns out that teams

00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:53,490
that have people from different ethnic

00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,500
and cultural backgrounds actually suffer

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,740
the dunning-kruger effect less than

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,810
teams that come from a single a single

00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,510
ethnic background and it turns out that

00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:06,710
in Asian cultures as well that there is

00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:08,430
actually the reverse effect of this so

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,830
basically the less do you know about

00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:13,950
something the great you know that your

00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:17,210
ability is to to not be able to actually

00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:19,230
recognize genuine skill and other people

00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,330
so another really simple way to remember

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:26,790
this is the incompetent glute and the

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:28,140
capable truck so we sort of talked about

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,690
a couple of different biases here the

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,000
three mean and sort of most well-known

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:37,530
biases confirmation bias hindsight bias

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,790
by joining krueger effect so who he

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:45,080
thinks that they are vulnerable to these

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:47,760
cooks your hands okay a few people so

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,500
everybody else you're probably saying

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,500
I'm aware of my biases right now these

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:56,760
don't affect me I am better than average

00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,190
so it turns out that this is a cognitive

00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,290
bias as well it's called the better than

00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:04,200
average effect and a loser II

00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:06,900
superiority basically everybody goes to

00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,090
their life thinking that they are better

00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,890
than average there's another another

00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,170
corner bias as well here as well cuz

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,250
they called the bias blind spot so

00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,690
people don't think that they are

00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:19,140
actually susceptible to these sort of

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:21,120
biases and the interesting thing with

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,580
the bias blind-spot actually is that for

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,610
biases that reinforce positive

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,780
attributes in people they think that

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,740
they have an above-average

00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:33,930
susceptibility to it but for biases that

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,960
emphasize accentuate negative attributes

00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:39,050
and people then they say that they have

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,960
a below average susceptibility to it

00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:44,640
interesting why well pretty simple it

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,870
all comes down to self esteem nobody

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,380
wants to go through life thinking that

00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:51,150
they are below average that they are you

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,580
know not not in control the situation

00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,920
the circumstances around them they've

00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,220
been dealt you know a faulty set of me

00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,800
weren't that is unable to accurately

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,850
produce rationalizing results yeah and

00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,470
like I said nobody wants to go through

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,870
their life thinking that they are

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,789
Lily out of control that you know they

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,140
are just being sort of dealt the cards

00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:14,250
that they were playing with the cards

00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,990
that they've been dealt so I've used

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,179
this little visitor rhymes as well

00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,650
through through the talk so confirmation

00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,870
reinforces you ignore other sources

00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,750
hines headlines for side finds the

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,740
competent gloat and the capable choke so

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,960
it turns out that I've actually been

00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,789
hacking you this entire talk as well so

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,250
this is another cognitive bias known as

00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:35,280
the rhyme as reason effect so it turns

00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,750
out that aesthetics effect truth the

00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,150
more that the more that something is

00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:42,390
fluent that it is fast that is smooth

00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:43,919
that it flows well the higher value you

00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,270
actually place on it which means that

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,220
you're more likely to believe me when I

00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:50,429
when I use a little Ryan described those

00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:54,659
particular cognitive biases so here's

00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:58,440
another really cute example of another

00:25:54,659 --> 00:26:01,230
cognitive bias so this is a test it's

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,039
really really simple I want you to read

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,990
the following statement once and I need

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,980
you to count the number of times that

00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:13,260
you see the letter F okay the statement

00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:17,360
is going to appear in this box don't

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,360
screw this up go

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,610
okay only once how many do you see so

00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:39,740
quick show of hands if they saw if you

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:50,130
saw three or less at the letter F okay

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:52,170
four five six seven eight that's an

00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,480
interesting spread so it turns out that

00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:57,150
the correct answer is actually eight so

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,360
the grads to everyone they got that so

00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,350
this is an under and it's an underlying

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,000
heuristic that's driving a lot of these

00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,000
other cognitive biases called the

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,770
fluency heuristic so your brain is

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,890
giving high weight two things the flow

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:13,370
well so what you're actually doing all

00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:15,720
the people that saw five or six or seven

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,480
you're focusing on the big words like

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,940
final folios from but you're actually

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:28,530
ignoring smaller words that join those

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:29,760
words to other words like of l still

00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:34,590
think that you're not susceptible to the

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,630
cognitive biases mmm your brain expects

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:39,650
that pattern to continue your brain

00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,460
skips over that other information and

00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,600
fortunately though there are a few

00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,280
things that you can do to counter this

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,750
behavior so you want to try and trigger

00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,370
more deliberate thinking when you're

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,580
getting people to run through processes

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:53,100
that are very detail-oriented so simple

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,810
ways to use checklists and maybe even

00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,310
induce a little bit of randomness in

00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,810
those checklists as well to keep people

00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,500
on their toes just so they're not doing

00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:03,360
the same thing day in day out another

00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,010
simple way to harness that behavior as

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,660
well which is pretty awesome is to rhyme

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,850
the things that you want people to

00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,040
remember you know the brain is giving

00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,780
high weight two things that flow more

00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,260
smoothly so Rhine the things that you

00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:18,330
want people to remember turns out that

00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,760
the styling of text as well the type of

00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,680
the type of typography that you use is

00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,970
actually really important so there was

00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,840
this great study done a couple of years

00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:30,300
ago where there was there's a large

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,830
group of people that were given a piece

00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,570
of paper I had a question read on it

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:36,240
written on it fifty percent of the

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,340
people had the question written in a it

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,020
was black on white black text on white

00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,070
background

00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:46,280
nice large sans-serif font easy to read

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:49,640
the other group of people had in a gray

00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:52,750
cursive font poor contrast difficult to

00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,730
read it was a very simple question and

00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:57,920
it turned out that the people that were

00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,650
given the the question on the with a

00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,260
grey curse of text actually tended to

00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:05,420
get the Coretta tend to get the answer

00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:07,550
wrong because their brain was spending

00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,800
so much time thinking about how to

00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:12,350
decode that text how to read the poorly

00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,850
contrast to text that by the time they

00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:17,000
actually even finish passing the

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:19,070
question and they were thinking about

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,740
what the actual answer was they were

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,510
already so choked up that they actually

00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,310
second-guessed there are incorrect

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,810
answer and so when they did a follow-up

00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:29,120
to all the people that answered

00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:30,920
incorrectly it turned out that they had

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,630
actually originally come to the right

00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,670
answer but because they were spending so

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:38,980
much time trying to pass the lad of that

00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:38,980
text they actually gave the wrong answer

00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:45,200
all right have you learned anything in

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,060
this talk let's see so I'm going to do

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,610
the same exercise again watched people

00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,320
in white passing the ball and to make it

00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:55,240
a little bit trickier I want you to tell

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,240
me what's on the chest of the gorilla

00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:22,710
alright did everybody get that so how

00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:26,370
many times have you see the ball past 16

00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:33,720
okay it's about 16 and what was on the

00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:35,130
gorillas chest here yeah that'll do all

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,299
right so did you see the curtain colors

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:42,179
change or do you see one of the players

00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:44,539
leave mmm let's go back and watch that

00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,539
again

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:04,970
here comes the gorilla I look one of the

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,050
black players have left look the

00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:13,490
curtains are completely different color

00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:15,440
now oops I think Mark Twain said this

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,000
best when he said that ya want you don't

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,440
know that gets you in trouble it's what

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,670
you know for sure that just ain't so I

00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,080
sort of believe that at this stage of

00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,190
where we are we DevOps creating good

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,260
culture is a little bit of a distraction

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:31,190
from the underlying problem culture is

00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:34,190
made from people understand how you

00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:37,010
think I understand how to become more

00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:38,860
rational and less rationalizing look out

00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:42,080
look out for these cognitive biases

00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:44,200
let's start improving ourselves and the

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,200
culture will start flowing from that

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,200
