	You Thought Implementing Devops Is Hard? Try Building a Shower in Your Workplace

This ignite is about hacking organizational culture, and how a seemingly impossible venture (building a fully functional shower in a place where there is no room or budget for it) can be made possible with a few simple (but determined) steps. It all started when I wanted to encourage people (including myself) to ride their bicycle to work, but needed a place to wash off our sweat after the intensive morning rides. By using this funny use case I'll demonstrate a few tricks I used that are very relevant to driving change in any organization.

Speaker:

Uri Cohen, GigaSpaces

Uri leads the product team at GigaSpaces, and is interested in everything cloud, scalability and devops. He's a spare time coder and proud father of 3. During the weekend, Uri masquerades as an all-mountain and occasionally downhill bicycle rider, trying his best to keep his body in one piece.
