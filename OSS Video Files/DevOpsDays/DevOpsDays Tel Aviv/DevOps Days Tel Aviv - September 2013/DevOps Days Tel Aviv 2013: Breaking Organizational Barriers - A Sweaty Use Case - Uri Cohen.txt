Title: DevOps Days Tel Aviv 2013: Breaking Organizational Barriers - A Sweaty Use Case - Uri Cohen

Description: 
	You Thought Implementing Devops Is Hard? Try Building a Shower in Your Workplace

This ignite is about hacking organizational culture, and how a seemingly impossible venture (building a fully functional shower in a place where there is no room or budget for it) can be made possible with a few simple (but determined) steps. It all started when I wanted to encourage people (including myself) to ride their bicycle to work, but needed a place to wash off our sweat after the intensive morning rides. By using this funny use case I'll demonstrate a few tricks I used that are very relevant to driving change in any organization.

Speaker:

Uri Cohen, GigaSpaces

Uri leads the product team at GigaSpaces, and is interested in everything cloud, scalability and devops. He's a spare time coder and proud father of 3. During the weekend, Uri masquerades as an all-mountain and occasionally downhill bicycle rider, trying his best to keep his body in one piece.

	00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:13,760
I want to talk about implementing

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,950
organizational change through a pretty

00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,329
funny use case not necessarily related

00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,089
to DevOps you're gonna understand how

00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:24,919
it's related in a second so let's wait

00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:30,800
for it to start ok this is the title

00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:34,520
slide so anyways I'll start now so I'm I

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,630
love riding my bikes and I usually do it

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,430
over weekends mostly mountain biking and

00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,340
you can see it here but I'm actually

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,140
really smiling during that bit that ride

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:50,060
so it's something that I really love to

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:53,060
do but the thing is I'm pretty busy ok

00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:56,900
I'm I don't have a lot of time during

00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,870
weekdays and I'm a full-time dad and I

00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,880
have a full-time job and father profiler

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,120
3 which doesn't doesn't leave a lot of

00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:11,450
time for doing my favorite activities

00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:14,990
besides working that is so I thought you

00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:17,030
know i'm spending about an hour in good

00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:21,350
days and more than hour and a half on

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:25,130
bad days in traffic and this is a wasted

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,510
time so I was kind of figuring ok

00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,770
there's an hour and a half here that i'm

00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,630
not using and not doing anything with

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,090
why don't I do that what I didn't do my

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,970
what my favorite stuff during that time

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,920
so the problem is is that this is how a

00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,020
look after I do the ride and wasn't

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,979
raining that day I actually sweat a lot

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:46,850
and I work with people so it's really

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:49,820
important that I clean up myself after I

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:57,110
take my morning rides so I need a place

00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:59,210
to wash myself um sorry yeah and we

00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,530
don't have a shower in the office so

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,080
you're probably wondering how all this

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,490
stuff is related to DevOps so it's

00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,360
really about pushing change in the

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:10,580
organization it's not just about pushing

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,980
technical changes this is a hardware and

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,790
culture change we need the hardware

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,709
changes building

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,879
our the culture chain is making people

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:21,980
actually come to work on their bikes so

00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,049
I take Jesse's rules this is jesse

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,519
robbins the founder of Opscode and he

00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:27,829
has some very nice rules that he laid

00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,290
out in one of the recent velocity

00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:32,150
conferences and these are very good

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,099
rules to push change the first rule it

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,349
starts small will trust so this is my

00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:38,900
shower now this is a it's called Healey

00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:41,810
of pressure shower and you can buy an

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,310
Amazon for a hundred bucks and the thing

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,459
on the bottom here is the actual place

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:50,239
where I take showers it's an at ease

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:53,000
balcony in his office and it's it's

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,620
working it's working second thing is

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,569
great champions this is your arm I don't

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,700
think he's here he goes yesterday so

00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:03,019
your rom actually saw me started doing

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:05,299
this stuff and he also kind of wanted to

00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:07,189
do it himself and he's coming and taking

00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:10,040
the shower in the same nice pressure

00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:11,629
shower third thing is we'll use metrics

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,129
to build confidence so I used to matrix

00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:15,290
the first one is that I actually lost a

00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:19,099
few pounds when i started doing this the

00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,349
second one is that research researches

00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:22,760
show that people that are actually fit

00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:25,220
are absent eighty percent less than

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,079
people don't often work the last thing

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,639
is celebrate success this is naughty and

00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:30,769
this is actually the sign that we hang

00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,659
it across the office because the shower

00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,250
is in is in his balcony and we call it

00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:37,340
the eternal shalam spa because his name

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:40,879
is naughty shalom so these are the

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,889
changes and after i been practicing it

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,229
for a few months I now have budget to

00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,870
actually build a shower we located a

00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:48,949
place in the building to do that we got

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,680
the permission of the building manager

00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:52,849
to do that and the shower is going to

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,510
happen so it's going to be there in

00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:58,280
about one or two months what are the

00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,120
lessons that we learned throughout the

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,650
process and you know what are the key

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,370
lessons here to push organizational

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,409
change so the first one is you will run

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,530
into a lot of skeptics just ignore them

00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:14,150
and at least five people told me nice

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,000
not gonna work you're not gonna do any

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,159
random stick up with it stump people

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,539
still kind of raised an eyebrow when I

00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:23,630
walk in the in the corridor with this

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:25,729
funny shower thing every morning the

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,840
second thing is that changes take takes

00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,720
time I think we've been talking

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,150
about this shower thing for I don't know

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:37,729
23 years now and people need to digest

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:40,060
need to make this in two steps you know

00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:43,040
gradually until until becomes reality

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,889
third thing is take one small step at a

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:51,080
time you can do a big changes we saw

00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:53,860
that in in the eToro session earlier so

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,270
you need to start small you need to be

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,940
creative about it be prepared to

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,100
improvise and I owe a lot to on here

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,040
which actually came up with a fresh

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,570
shower idea in the first place and I

00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,340
said why not you know I'm gonna try it

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,450
on myself and see if it works I have

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,610
nothing to lose here no it's not here

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:16,370
and the last lesson is you need a

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:21,190
management sponsors so luckily my CEO is

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:23,510
also very fond of bicycle rides and is

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,919
appreciative to the cause and that's how

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:29,449
we got the shower running so this is all

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,100
true you know so if you push changing

00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,240
organization all these rules apply it

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,630
doesn't matter what they change your

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:40,419
you're pushing these rules are always

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,419
