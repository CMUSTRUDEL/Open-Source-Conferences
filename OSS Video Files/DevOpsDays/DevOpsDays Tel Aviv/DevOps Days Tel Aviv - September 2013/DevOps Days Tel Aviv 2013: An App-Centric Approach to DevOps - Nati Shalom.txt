	00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,429
yes so now you're gonna hear me doing

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:17,539
something that I usually don't do talk

00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:19,580
about gigas places so this is lucky for

00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:22,280
you it's only five minutes so you're not

00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,630
going to get bugged about that yeah how

00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:30,200
many people are here developers quite a

00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:32,029
bit and how many our ops nice i think

00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,340
that that in itself you know like two

00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:35,990
years ago I went oh that's that question

00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,580
I wouldn't get that answer so I think

00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,020
itself I think is a big success having

00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,640
developers and ops in the same room

00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,770
talking almost the same language talking

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,690
about the same tools that's impressive

00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,550
so the thing that I wanted to talk about

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,739
is really the things that connects ops

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,140
and developers and that's kind of the

00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:53,030
main theme of this talk which is an

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,350
application centric as I would say a

00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,790
DevOps it sounds kind of weird what is

00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:05,899
application centric DevOps I'll get to

00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:07,579
that in a second okay so so these

00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,770
pictures I think pretty much speaks for

00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:12,499
itself if we look at the full cycle of

00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,270
an application not just how we deploy it

00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:16,219
in production but how do we develop it

00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,899
until it gets the production there is a

00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:19,939
continuing process here I'm not going to

00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:21,920
talk too much about that that continuing

00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:24,139
process included a lot of steps it

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,549
includes the obviously the development

00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:27,679
testing and trial and actually there is

00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:29,659
a receiving the prior to that there is

00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:31,909
an evaluation step there is a POC that

00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:33,679
we're doing you continuously evolve

00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,270
things until they actually get into

00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:37,789
productions and that's kind of the big

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,590
picture if we look at things now the

00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,749
reality of thing is it's pretty much

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,249
looks like that if we want to build the

00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:44,840
DevOps environment usually we have

00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:46,819
different tools for each of those stages

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,289
we have different tools for the

00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:49,929
development stages different tools for

00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:52,279
production different tools for the code

00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:54,200
versioning and different tools to do the

00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:57,229
rest of the things and we end up with

00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,869
that jungle of tools as I would say and

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,759
actually Ron had an interesting talk

00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,579
about that last year the DevOps last

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,859
year we came to I think a conclusion

00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:09,470
that I completely agree with in which

00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,269
there is this infrastructure tools and

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,220
the rails application deployment tools

00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:14,750
that are not the same because when you

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,010
think about infrastructure you think

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,720
about machines networks

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,189
and so forth when you think about

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,159
application you think about tears

00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:24,110
databases and where my code is running

00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,909
and how the application is structured

00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,799
which kind of drives a completely

00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:29,599
different way of thinking on how you lay

00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:31,220
out things even how you draw things in

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,480
the board would look very different if

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,400
you think about it from an application

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,269
centric view versus if you think about

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,159
it from an infrastructure perspective

00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:44,030
that's kind of the main point here so

00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,950
when when I kind of Drew I took actually

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,950
a slide from I brought a lot of slides

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,109
actually hear from worries where we made

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,170
a presentation in the last stop and

00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:55,730
stack event that we had and I think the

00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:00,489
thing that I like to is that it kind of

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:03,109
broke that statement that run made why

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,310
infrastructure provisioning tools or

00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:05,840
infrastructure configuration management

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,000
tools are different than application

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,250
centric views and if you really look at

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,530
the entire continuum here what you

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,030
really see is that this is the steps

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,040
these are the things that you need to

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,359
have in order to actually build

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,950
something like that if you look at the

00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:20,900
loved configuration management tools

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,230
chef and puppet would be a good example

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,690
for that they really tend to be overused

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,180
in certain areas and very good at

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,949
certain areas so there would be very

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,419
good at configuration management they

00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:34,040
could be they could be used for

00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:35,329
deployment of applications and

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,250
orchestration of application but they're

00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:38,840
not very good at that and that's

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,699
something that I think most people don't

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,980
realize well and they try to take a tool

00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:45,139
and kind of overuse it across the entire

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,510
continuum versus understanding that you

00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:49,190
know every tool has its sweet spot and

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,260
if you ever use it it actually becomes

00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,030
very complex it's like again you have an

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,560
assembler and you trying to write in

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,970
assembler here you could write the

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,069
entire application assembly but why

00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,540
would you do that it said an area that

00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,980
would be good but it's going to be give

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,329
you a lot of performance or much better

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,889
performance but its inner areas it's

00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:06,199
going to be too verbose to do certain

00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,329
things so it's not like those tools

00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:11,120
cannot do certain things and it's not

00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:13,659
features that cannot be done it's using

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,820
the right tools for the right place so

00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:18,380
again going in that other spectrum I

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,810
talked about the infrastructure side so

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,370
the past kind of world kind of taking

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,169
the approach the opposite approach in

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,409
which it tends to be very good at code

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:28,940
development and from their perspective a

00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:30,440
lot of the past says you know

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,630
got about infrastructure there is no

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,340
bulbs we take care about the Alps you

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,650
can take our route code the rest is

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,810
trivial and they trivialize all the rest

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:42,200
of the configuration where the reality

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:46,340
is that we actually need them both and I

00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:49,070
think the all of us has that thought in

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,510
mind we kind of when we work to that we

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,910
kind of realized that that's really the

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,440
reality that we need them both but it

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,970
was very hard to articulate it and one

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,560
of the things that I liked about Amazon

00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,930
is that they're kind of forward thinking

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,630
because they're running that massive

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,300
marketplace that forced them to react

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,100
faster than us most of the market so if

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,450
you really want to know what the future

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,800
of DevOps looks like what the future of

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,600
righty looks like just look at the

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Amazon and you know it that's as simple

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,170
as that and Amazon had those two angle

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:22,190
in in in the spectrum they had

00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:24,350
infrastructure which is yep geez these

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,090
things the infrastructure as a service

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,820
cloud formation which is a templating

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,100
model and they add pass interestingly

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,340
enough in April or marriage last year

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:38,120
they brought that new piece here that

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:40,190
thing and in a nutshell that thing is

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,800
really talking about these two angles

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,630
here which is the control the

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,890
infrastructure I want to control the

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,150
network I want to control the machines

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,230
that I'm running I want to control the

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,000
infrastructure that I'm running and how

00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,370
it's going to be earning I want to be in

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,650
control of all those things and this is

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,440
the developers says I want to develop

00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:02,030
code fast I don't want to care too much

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,530
about that so that piece is really all

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,860
about bringing those two pieces together

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,570
and trying to give us better trade-offs

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,060
between control and convenience II I

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,380
don't have a lot of time to go into what

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,970
we're doing in that space but in a

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,680
nutshell the thing that I wanted to

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,150
remember is that what we're doing with

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,650
clarify is really trying to implement

00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,690
the same concept that Amazon did the

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,950
dogs works elsewhere so if you have your

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,320
own private environment or if you're

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,270
running outside of Amazon and you need

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,310
something like that we do that and

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,800
that's kind of the project that were

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,120
launched a couple of years ago called

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,370
clarify and say what open source

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,090
framework this is where i'm getting a

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,250
very vendor specific and and in a

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,500
nutshell it really tries to speak the

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,950
language of an application and plug into

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,630
the info

00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,640
structure so it plugs into chef it plugs

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,220
into puppet but the interface that you

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,810
have is tears I have a web tier have an

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,580
application tier having a load bouncer

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,130
and that's how you provision things and

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,160
it plugs into the infrastructure kind of

00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,050
behind the scenes so to conclude that we

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,060
really look at the entire world as

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,030
something especially in a develops

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,400
context as a continuum of process in

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,800
which we developing apps with developing

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,050
pieces of apps with developing tiers of

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,990
apps and services and apps and if you

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,970
can interact with that and make the appt

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,740
interact with the infrastructure then we

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,570
get the two side of the spectrum again

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,130
have five minutes I can't really get

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,050
into the details of how that is being

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,820
done unfortunately but that's kind of

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,560
the in a nutshell the idea we have the

00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,510
guys who actually build a blueprint and

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,730
we have guys who consume that blueprint

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,310
and that's again in a nutshell what

00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,350
we're trying to do and the end result

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,690
the way in which we can have that smiley

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,070
faces across that spectrum is by

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,640
integrating those tools in the right

00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,950
places and having the orchestration talk
