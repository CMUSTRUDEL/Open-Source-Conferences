okay so I'm wrong public soft serve and

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,690
I'm gonna be talking today about the

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,400
projects we call names for rock and why

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,180
we're gonna see an elitist latest

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,070
slightest so first of all let me

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,039
introduce myself as a speaker I'm

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,619
working an IT branch from almost 12

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,940
years and 10 years with soft serve and

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:39,480
doing operations like everybody do here

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:42,629
for almost eight years and we start with

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,399
operations then was DevOps and then

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:49,289
what's going to come next after the wops

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:54,120
we probably can assume and so Spurlock

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:57,210
wise rock this is there was a we have a

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,760
this code to environment chain as a

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,850
piece of the long continuous delivery

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,309
chain and we decided in the lab we

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,830
develop the tool that speeds up and we

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,350
gave the name to it as frog this is the

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,409
ancient slavic god of blacksmithing so

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:18,540
you take the any raw piece of metal and

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:23,640
make a very good thing and so first of

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:26,220
all the idea the idea is that you have

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,689
any type of source code you have its

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:33,450
compiler maven and make whatever else is

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:37,430
and then you just add some tiny

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:41,670
framework you configure it and you have

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:45,180
the benefit and so initially we create

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,640
the tool as a some lab script that just

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,579
quickly builds the RPM packages and then

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,220
as it always happens everybody start

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,040
loving it so it starts to be a tool that

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,649
is widely using a soft serve and why

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,079
actually people start using it and when

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,240
so when it comes like i need to i have

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,909
some java tool that i need to quickly

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,099
package and deploy it oh i just need to

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,450
show that the cover this continuous

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:13,770
delivery path of for our client this is

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,950
when you start

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,860
using it so as I said contiez deliver is

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:24,210
a long thing but very small block of it

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:28,140
is the tool that we develop and so what

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,840
does this to make does and is it the

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,910
another D doesn't make tool it's no so

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,670
you still use and you still use maven

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:40,680
you can use rake whatever else you use

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:43,890
but on top of a TS you can make packages

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,860
and Debbie ins rpms any other types

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:50,040
package you invent at this is what you

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,960
do is that to ease usage is simple you

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,910
format the source code by adding

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,720
specific files and configuration and

00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,000
runs for command virag will look for

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,160
make file with extensions for rock with

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,450
a specifically formatted it's a key

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,540
value file and it will it starts it will

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,910
start bringing and building the packages

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,440
and repositories the RPM would have been

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,450
depending how we define it and depending

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,490
what system you run what does it mean

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,610
like specifically formatting the file

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:24,980
the source code it means that you add

00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,980
the same class as you

00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:36,660
okay let me continue the some microphone

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:36,660
so you have so so stay out of the exam

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:51,550
ok so we currently support Carly support

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,800
yah yah a poster and are we have

00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:58,210
packages as well as we support de Leon

00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:00,160
to us attitude and of course the source

00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,550
code can be cool either from subversion

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,200
gifts or any other source control system

00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,410
as well as the idea by Peggy Biggs and

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,690
step all that because it's a plug-in

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,480
based of course how is written is

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,600
written in path plus pile well no

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,850
assembler is just kidding and you can

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,580
get it from our github community that

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,260
surrounds we write to open source tool

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,820
but right now because it contains two

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,330
pieces of coded weeks till you're

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:31,410
shaking it make open source is its

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,000
revised by you quest so just if any mail

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,360
finding a treasure I will give you

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,620
access to this tofu and you will try it

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,520
probably you will find the magnified

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,520
