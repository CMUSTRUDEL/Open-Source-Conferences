Title: DevOps Days Tel Aviv 2013: How not to do Devops.Confessions of a Thought Leader Stephen Nelson Smith
Publication date: 2013-10-24
Playlist: DevOps Days Tel Aviv - September 2013
Description: 
	At every conference I go to, and as a member of the core Devopsdays team, I see a lot of proposals too, it seems that 99% of talks are of the sort: ""I did this awesome thing - you should too!"" or ""This is awesome - you should try it!"". However the reality for experienced people is more often ""I tried this, and messed up badly - here's what I learned, and how you can avoid the pain I suffered"".

I've been a Devops practitioner, activist, enthusiast and consultant since day one. I keynoted at the second ever Devopsdays. And I've run a consulting firm specialising in Devops ideas for 7 years. That means I've made a ton of mistakes. Many of them painful and costly.

In this talk I will bare my soul - tell you all about the terrible mistakes I've made, and explore lessons learned, so we can all learn from the things I've done wrong.

Speaker:

Stephen Nelson-Smith

Principal Consultant at Atalanta Systems; Devops/Cloud Visionary; Author of 'Test-driven Infrastructure with Chef' and forthcoming 'Chef: The Definitive Guide', Opscode Chef trainer.

	00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:14,549
alright good morning everyone I'm trying

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,250
to decide how I interpret the sparse

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,869
number of people at my talk it could be

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,789
because you all think I'm terrible and

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,400
boring and you're fed up of the sound of

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,800
my voice from yesterday it could be that

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,349
you all decided that John and linds who

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,789
is so amazing and they are I was so

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,890
amazing and you could only devote one

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,570
day to DevOps you would go to that day

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,059
instead of this day it could be that you

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,239
all ate too much beer and drank too much

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,280
pizza or it could be something entirely

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,989
different but there's a good a good

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,800
bunch and I hope what I gotta say is

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:57,149
it's very useful to you this talk is

00:00:46,800 --> 00:01:00,690
fundamentally about mistakes so know is

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:03,030
what it says mistakes so this is about

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,119
mistakes that I have made in the last

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,189
well i guess i've been doing devops for

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,650
well as long as it's existed as a named

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,780
concept and a little bit longer beyond

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,689
that i've been a consultant for much of

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,250
that time and in that time I've made a

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,590
whole bunch of mistakes and the thinking

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,180
behind this talk was rather than just

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,009
going along to a conference where some

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,479
really smart person stands up and says

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,189
hey I did all these great things you

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,570
should do them too and you take notes

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,890
eagerly and you go away and try and

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,200
implement the same cool thing that they

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,579
did instead I'd stand up and say hey

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,500
here's a bunch of really dumb things

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,950
that I did you shouldn't do that so

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,259
that's the plan so your quest is to find

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,540
the Warlocks treasure hidden deep within

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,729
a dungeon populated with a multitude of

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,470
terrifying monsters you will need

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,030
courage determination and a fair amount

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,460
of luck if you were to survive all the

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,740
traps and battles and reach your goal

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,310
the innermost chambers of the Warlocks

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,869
domain to dice a pencil and a razor are

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,390
all you need to make your journey you

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,540
decide which routes to follow which

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,229
dangerous to risk and which monsters to

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,270
fight this is indebted to Adam Jacob who

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:13,130
does an exceptional choose your own

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:16,520
adventure DevOps talk in which you

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,380
to pick different things so you saw

00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,940
daeun Sparta cepe shin you say which

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,560
picture do you want to hear about i'll

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,360
tell you the story and then we'll pick

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,400
another picture the thinking behind this

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,810
is i only have 30 minutes it's entirely

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,820
possible we weren't that to cover all

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,130
nine pictures but that's okay because

00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:35,600
there's gems of wonderfulness behind

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:38,150
each one and a surprise so i would like

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,680
you to shout out which picture you would

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,530
like to cover first you want a picture

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,370
of me a sort of path thumbs up and

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:52,400
thumbs down a car ah the car you want

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:59,540
the car okay ignore the signs of burnout

00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,860
okay so actually the whole idea behind

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,810
this talk is I'm going to start off by

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,280
talking about a mistake I'm going to

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,240
tell you a story about how I committed

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,370
that mistake and what the consequences

00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,500
were and then I'm going to tell you

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,030
about why it's a mistake and we're going

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,560
to cover some of the philosophy and some

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,380
of the psychology behind what makes

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,030
these things errors were why they don't

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,580
work and then I'm going to propose an

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,900
antidote what can you do in your life

00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,940
practically to try and prevent

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,320
yourselves making that mistake I'm go

00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,240
try to give you some actionable advice

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,320
so that's the basic the five-step

00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,060
process that we're going to go through

00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,650
for each story so the first thing is

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,170
what is it what's the mistake the

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:38,270
mistake is just go back the mistake is

00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:41,270
ignore the signs of burnet okay so this

00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,250
year and there's certainly one person in

00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,190
the room who's been a victim of this

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,540
this year I've been really unreliable

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,720
and the reason for that is I have been

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:54,580
working really really really really hard

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:58,850
for about three years without a break

00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:01,370
getting very very little sleep sometimes

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,800
no sleep at all for several days whilst

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,390
trying to do two or three jobs at the

00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,750
same time as well as writing a second

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:11,390
edition of a book now smart people would

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,180
call that over commitment I would call

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,220
that being indestructible fact of the

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,590
matter is I am not indestructible and

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,620
the results that was I got really really

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,060
really really sick and when I say really

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,030
really really sick I mean I did

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,750
contemplate suicide as recently as this

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,750
summer

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,900
I let down close friends I let down

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,790
family I let down colleagues and I

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,040
damaged myself my reputation and the

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,590
reputation of my industry and so those

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,180
of you who follow me on Twitter those of

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,680
you who have read stuff that I've

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,570
written those of you who i have taught I

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,160
am sorry because I've set you a bad

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,440
example by getting so badly burned out

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,360
and making a horrific mess of my life in

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,730
the last couple of years likewise sorry

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,740
to hell and I my wife sorry to Andy with

00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:57,080
whom I work quite closely and other

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,580
people so that's the that's what's

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,919
happened the consequences of that is

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,470
that you do yourself personal damage and

00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,090
you do your your damage to your

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,120
reputation to your job into the people

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,410
you work with so it's interesting that

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,919
the Japanese have a word for this

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:15,110
karoshi which means death by overwork so

00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,510
this actually means that particularly in

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,520
the manufacturing sector there are

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,930
there's a but there's an ethic of work

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,130
which says you work in you working

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,950
you're working you pushing you push and

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:27,560
you push to the extent that people are

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,940
actually dying or stress or dying of

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,380
overwork quite literally and there are

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,600
statistics and there are government

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,790
bureaus designed to identify this

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,200
pattern and there are large companies

00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,880
putting together processes which say

00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,310
what should we do to prevent death by

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,540
overwork this is a real thing and the

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,250
thing is I think this is real thing in

00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,560
our industry too because we have a whole

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,000
concept of hero culture around working

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,630
too hard and we need to be really

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,630
careful to avoid that so how many of you

00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,910
have identified or can identify with any

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,740
of these things incidentally I normally

00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,690
put no words on my slides but there's so

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,160
much content in this I've gone for the

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,110
option to putting loads of words on the

00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,340
slides not expecting you necessarily to

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,479
be able to read them but you'll be able

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,830
to read them afterwards because there's

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,440
so much stuff you won't be able to take

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,060
notes or remember it so how many of you

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,060
have done extremely long hours at

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,620
interfere with normal rest patterns

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,210
quite a few how many of you have done

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,210
night work that interferes with normal

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,350
rest patterns yeah a whole bunch how

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,260
many of you have done working without

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,880
holidays or breaks yeah quite a few how

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,940
many of you have done high-pressure work

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,260
without breaks yeah fair few how many of

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,840
you have done either extremely demanding

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,630
physical labor or continuously stressful

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,539
work yeah okay those are the five

00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,650
patterns which the Japanese government

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,630
have identified as leading to

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:46,350
by overwork so if you're doing some of

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,449
those things i recommend you stop here's

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,360
another question are you creating

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:54,030
artificial relaxation and alertness how

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,900
many of you have an be honest because

00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:00,539
Libby's recording you how many of you

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,660
compensate for your stress by being

00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:07,860
highly alerts by sedating using alcohol

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:10,860
marijuana or other sedatives only only

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,800
one apparently haha oh no okay that's

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,360
more like it okay similarly if you have

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,250
stuff to get through you're working

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,930
really hard on a tough deadline even

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,820
though your body is crying out to you to

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,210
take a break how many of you medicate

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,770
using caffeine cocaine or amphetamines

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,419
okay I've still only two people wow you

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,800
guys are the most healthy audience now

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:32,669
there's more than two people for the

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,500
camera okay so if you're doing either of

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,120
those things and I know you are even if

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,130
you don't want to admit it in front of

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,169
everybody else if you're doing either of

00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,800
those two things that's a sign that you

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:46,199
are burning out so here is the antidote

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,479
now I'm very very pleased that you chose

00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,229
this one first again Marshall be

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,180
Rosenberg is a psychologist he wrote an

00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:55,370
exceptional book called nonviolent

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,360
communication I'm going to be covering

00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,639
nonviolent communication in various

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,740
aspects throughout the talk but he has a

00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,590
saying which says do not do anything

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,080
that isn't play what do we mean by play

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,780
well if you look at a child playing I

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,150
have four children the youngest is just

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,470
for the oddest is 11 they all are very

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,630
good at playing and when you watch them

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,310
playing they're not motivated by how do

00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,199
I play really well how am I going to be

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,449
measured by my play they didn't have a

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,099
feel that they have to play they don't

00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:25,289
feel any kind of shame they didn't feel

00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:27,650
any kind of fear they just play they

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:30,990
play at the joy from their heart a

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:34,140
marshal be Rosenberg says that our work

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,390
should be play we should be doing work

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,159
from an attitude of giving from a

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,690
compassionate art we should be doing

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,760
work because it's something that we care

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,979
about something that we love something

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,709
that we enjoy and we should not be doing

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,930
work out of a sense of fear or duty or

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,820
guilt or shame and if we're doing those

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,260
that constitutes violence and I'll talk

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,640
about that later but

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,290
whole theory is that you need to be

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,460
thinking in terms of and there's a whole

00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,800
bunch of stuff you can read about this

00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,720
but you need to be thinking about your

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,950
work as play and that means you should

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,810
be having fun that means you should be

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,000
breaking when you need to that means you

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,920
need to be being extremely mindful as

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,480
you work make sure that you're enjoying

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,750
yourself and if you're not you need to

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,210
take a break so watch out for signs of

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,630
violence if you ever find yourself at

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,730
work being played by feelings of guilt

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,550
feelings of duty feelings of shame or

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,500
feelings of fear you're experiencing

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,330
violence that's not violence that

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
somebody's being violent to you the

00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,600
person who is being violent to you is

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,070
yourself so if you find that you're

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,440
working or I really need to finish this

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,210
dining to stay late I know I told my

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,160
wife I'd be home for dinner but actually

00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,660
I'm just going to stay and work because

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm feel guilty that I took time off

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,430
last week or I feel a sense of duty it's

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,350
it's on me to make this project work I

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,510
feel shamed actually the code I

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,160
committed was really poor or I'm afraid

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,660
you know what if this if this project

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,280
fails I'm going to lose my contract and

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,920
then the family's going to be in trouble

00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,250
those are signs of violence you need to

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,430
watch out for them so here's some

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,440
practical advice disconnect consider

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,570
switching off your phone completely when

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,300
you get home from work consider checking

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,280
your email any once or twice a day

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,570
consider taking long weekends and not

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,250
taking any form of communication with

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,590
you switch off your damn computer

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,240
already turn off Twitter turn off the

00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,860
things which connect you to your work so

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,570
that you can actually tune into

00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,930
something completely different sleep

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:28,170
well and sleep enough eat eat often

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:30,390
don't skip meals eat healthily don't eat

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,800
junk food whatever you do to nourish

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,300
yourself spiritually whether that's

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,490
prayer or meditation or something else

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,290
do that don't neglect your spiritual

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,840
side if you're an atheist and that's

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,010
that's loads of people are now that

00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,390
doesn't mean you don't have a spiritual

00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,920
side you might not call it spiritual but

00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,960
you need to do some kind of nourishing

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,910
which looks after your emotional

00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,080
well-being also you need to look after

00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,940
your physical well-being you need to

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:55,200
exercise and you need to play you need

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:57,090
to do stuff for fun so Leonardo da Vinci

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,710
says it is a very good plan every now

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,020
and then to go away and have a little

00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,180
relaxation when you come back to the

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,570
work your judgment will be sure since to

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,640
remain constantly a word

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,440
will cause you to lose the power of

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,490
judgment he's a pretty smart guy so I

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,530
think you should pay attention to him

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:19,090
okay another picture me a picture of me

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:24,580
okay cool whoa no pictures that focus on

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:26,650
the tools go back oh no okay the picture

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,410
of me just tells you who i am there's

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:34,960
only one slide so Who am I well I missus

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:36,610
admin i'm also an expert on agile

00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,160
infrastructure and automated

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,450
infrastructure particularly with chef

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,480
I've been doing DevOps for a really long

00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,980
time I've been part of the devil's

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,270
movement from the very very first day

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:52,390
along with Lindsay and John and Patrick

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,400
and few other people beyond that i'm

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,930
also a buddhist which means i'm very

00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,850
interested in training my mind and being

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,910
mindful and i'm also a yogi which means

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,270
i'm very bendy all of that serves to

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,830
tell you that I have some experience of

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,240
working in this industry I've also been

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,880
a consultant for a long time of work for

00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,990
a lot of clients both big and small I've

00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,360
made a lot of money and I've made a lot

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,520
of mistakes so that means I can qualify

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:22,540
to tell you about things that's the end

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:24,460
of me so next picture eat all the cake

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,900
okay whip vote votes for eat all the

00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,810
cake or votes for thumbs up thumbs down

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,330
hands up for thumbs up thumbs down okay

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:38,050
hands up for all the things okay all the

00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:40,030
things wins fix all the things okay so

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,230
fix all the things this is a really

00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,300
interesting one and this has happened to

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,480
me on a number of projects the most

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,710
obvious of which is a project in which I

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,210
was working for a client and I'll

00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,020
unfortunately have to not lame these

00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,450
clients because it'll be embarrassing

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,330
for them as well as for me I was working

00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,100
for a client who had a small rails

00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:00,220
application running on a few servers in

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:03,250
their office and this client approached

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,480
me and and they said we're a bit

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,640
concerned about running this stuff in

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,990
our office because you know what if we

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,150
have lose connectivity what if we lose

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,800
power that'll be really bad for us all

00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,850
so we're kind of thinking about maybe we

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,649
might need to have a disaster recovery

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,779
site or at least a second site somewhere

00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:19,670
we've been using chef to automate some

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:22,220
of it but it's not really very well

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,829
automated maybe you could come and help

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,749
us fix the automation and move the stuff

00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:29,540
out to the office yeah no problem

00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:31,730
thought I so that sounds like a pretty

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,759
straightforward task really really small

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,829
rails app not really very high traffic

00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,269
move it off a couple of servers in the

00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:39,740
office to somewhere else maybe the Clyde

00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:41,509
maybe somewhere else maybe can set up a

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,399
second site and fix the chef automation

00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:46,759
like a couple of weeks work maximum

00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:49,369
really simple a year and a half later I

00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,629
hadn't done it ok a year and a half

00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:53,899
later I hadn't done that I let me

00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:56,439
explain why the main reason for that is

00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:59,389
because I decided in my infinite wisdom

00:13:56,439 --> 00:14:00,949
but the thing I should do was take this

00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:03,519
rails application which running quite

00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:06,499
happily on a bunty and run it on solaris

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,779
now that's because i really love solaris

00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:13,339
now solaris is without a doubt the best

00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:15,709
operating system on the planet if you

00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:17,809
look at smart house or if you look at

00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:19,369
Omni oz these are currently the most

00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:21,170
advanced and the best operating systems

00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:22,910
that you can turn to there's lots of

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:26,870
technical reasons why you would be wise

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:28,819
to turn your operations run them on a

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,110
slower space platform apart from the

00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:31,459
fact that it's probably a little bit

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,959
more difficult to get going there's less

00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:34,759
community support and you've probably

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,519
never done it before so actually doing

00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,410
that would be really stupid and

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,209
that's what I did even though I know a

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,889
hell of a lot about slice I've done

00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:44,569
heaps and heaps and heaps of slice I

00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:47,269
hadn't run a rails app on ass lares box

00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:50,540
before I hadn't run our vm on ass Lara

00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:51,499
Spock's bashan before so and then turns

00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,269
out that there were a bunch of other

00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:55,929
things that I didn't know about like the

00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:58,819
requirement to connect some weird USB

00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:00,740
device thing which accepted stuff from a

00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:02,870
satellite like oh yeah guess what

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,929
there's no driver ants large flat really

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,759
no so another common thing that

00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:09,319
I've done is I've gone in to see

00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,730
somebody and they've said oh we need to

00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:12,499
fix this thing over here and lose

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,629
problem and I look and I said oh my God

00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:16,699
look at your monitoring is terrible so

00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:18,920
then I'll spend some time sorting out

00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:20,600
monitoring and then well no and actually

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,189
you know you really you really need to

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,959
fix that that puppet stuff over there

00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:26,240
because you're using a really were the

00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,939
old way and it just still and loads of

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,859
time has gone by and then I

00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:32,470
fix the real problem I have done that

00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:33,609
I'm really good at this okay it might

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,889
not sound like it but I am actually

00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:38,349
really good at this but fix all the

00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:41,379
things is a common mistake to make no a

00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:43,299
caveat sometimes it is necessary to fix

00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:45,189
all the things but as a general rule of

00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:49,359
thumb you want to fix only one thing

00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:51,639
okay hang on a second here we go this I

00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:53,859
think is one of the very most important

00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,509
things i'm going to say today and we'll

00:15:53,859 --> 00:16:04,869
see whether we can get more success with

00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:10,689
with the same they're too quiet too

00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:13,839
quiet so jam pot we fail more often

00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:15,189
because we solve the wrong problem than

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,319
because we get the wrong problem to the

00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:19,359
right solution this is Russell a cough I

00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:22,509
think it'd be fair to call him a student

00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:24,759
of deming certainly a greatly informed

00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:26,649
by deming's thought so Russell a cop

00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,059
says we fail more often because we

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:29,139
failed to be solve the wrong problem

00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:31,209
than because we get the wrong solution

00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:32,470
to the right problem this is at the root

00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:34,119
of most of the mistakes you will ever

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,519
make whether their personal mistakes or

00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:39,119
whether they're technical mistakes make

00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,649
sure you are solving the right problem

00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:43,089
so this is a lot of text I'm going to

00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:44,349
read it to you it comes from an

00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,029
excellent book which I'm sure many of

00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:48,369
you have read by Tom and Mary a pop and

00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:51,069
dick leading lean software development

00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:54,159
how many a via reddit okay why three

00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:56,559
okay you need to read this book so they

00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,209
say we chase the latest ideas in

00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,149
software development without bothering

00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:02,919
with a scientific method we think it is

00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:05,500
a waste of time to understand the theory

00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,419
create hypotheses run experiments gather

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,129
data and find out what really works in

00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:12,339
our environment we fail to appreciate

00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:13,539
the best practices are somebody else's

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,339
solutions to their problems not

00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:17,679
necessarily the right solutions to our

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,329
problems we adopt new development

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,759
approaches with an unhealthy dose of

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,259
wishful thinking rather than determining

00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,079
the most appropriate practices for our

00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:29,169
environment and then we are surprised at

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,730
the disappointing results as a very very

00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:32,830
common mistake that is made in the devil

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,389
twirled cargo cult in somebody else's

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,299
culture somebody else's technology

00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:39,549
without scientific method or without

00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:41,049
understanding it without analyzing and

00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:45,009
assessing your own situation

00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:48,940
so here's the antidote beware of shiny

00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:51,100
things so I had an experience earlier

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,379
this year when i was on a startup

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,450
incubator and a couple of people with a

00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:57,610
really smart idea they came over to me

00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,429
and this is steven we're trying to

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,470
decide what we should use the technology

00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:04,869
platform for us tight up nice of ya sure

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,159
ok i ask away they said well we're

00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:09,789
currently trying to choose between using

00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:11,200
rails on nodejs so i said well i'm ok i

00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,960
need to know a little bit more about

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,249
what it is you're trying to do but no

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,299
they're both fine platforms depending on

00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:17,859
what problem you're trying to solve and

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,369
they told me a bit more and i said no

00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:22,509
though ok fair enough have you ever used

00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:26,320
rails before if you've used a nun that

00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:27,639
we haven't oh ok oh do you know any

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,139
programming languages I mean that have

00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:32,139
you never done any programming before or

00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:34,359
oh yeah yeah we've used PHP so I okay

00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:38,289
well why don't you build it in PHP I'll

00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:40,090
cuz PHP's bad really yeah yeah PHP has

00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:42,669
performance problems as it doesn't have

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:45,190
any nice frameworks and you know ok but

00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:48,609
how long have you been using PHP about

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,859
seven years so have you ever built any

00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:53,590
applications yeah quite a few any of

00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:56,259
them running in production yeah any of

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:58,509
them high scale yeah ok so you're

00:18:56,259 --> 00:19:01,600
actually pretty good at PHP so why don't

00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:03,580
you build it in PHP oh well because PHP

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,840
has performance problems bueller you

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,429
don't know that you don't know if that's

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,019
going to be Vella ventoux your current

00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:09,489
situation and you're suggesting that you

00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:10,929
got to go off and build it in rails

00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:12,700
which you've never touched before or

00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:14,230
nodejs which you've never touched before

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,869
on something as risky as your own

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,980
startup they wear shiny things don't do

00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:22,570
that in the end they elected to use Ruby

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,609
and fairly often they wander over to me

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,769
and they say I'm having real real

00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:31,389
problem with active record dude active

00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:33,850
record I mean ok so abandoned technical

00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:35,259
purity if you love red hat and that's

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,999
fine that's cool for you to love red hat

00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,440
that doesn't mean that your first task

00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:40,059
when you take on a project which is

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,039
running on debian is to ditch debian

00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:43,419
that would be dumb and for God's sake

00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:46,720
don't run it on solaris unless you

00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:49,960
really know what you're doing exercising

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,129
real options is very interesting how

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,670
many of you are familiar with the idea

00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:56,350
of options in the trading context

00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,420
okay so the idea is that you might have

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,430
an option to buy or an option to sell

00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,710
some stock in something at a certain

00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,810
point in time there are three important

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,420
things you need to know about options

00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:10,930
they have an expiry date they have value

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,460
and you shouldn't commit early unless

00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,140
you know exactly what you're doing these

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,480
are the three things they have an expiry

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,280
date they have some value and you should

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,450
not necessarily commits early unless you

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,370
know what you're doing just talking with

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,320
Lindsay about this on the way over this

00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,760
morning I said if the diff it was

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,400
nineteen eighty and somebody gave you

00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,690
some options in Microsoft as you decided

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,180
Great God these options going to spend

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,730
them now that would not be wise okay

00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,840
because there's options have value now

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,210
it turns out this correlates very

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,850
closely to the concepts in lean software

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,460
of deferring your decisions to the last

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,680
responsible moment now what those are

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,600
actually is options at the beginning of

00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,190
a project whether it's a project to

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,930
implement some infrastructure or whether

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,550
it's a project to build some software

00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,320
you are presented with a bunch of

00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,940
options and usually what we do what we

00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,350
are trained to do is to make decisions

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,930
early okay we're going to run it on

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,300
Rails we're going to run it on on a bun

00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,400
to we're going to roast it in amazon etc

00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,310
etc at that point you have a bunch of

00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,720
options limiting your options up front

00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,250
and obviously there are many more

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,500
complicated chooses that you could make

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,300
limiting those options right up front is

00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,330
actually not a good idea because there

00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,490
is value in deferring your decision so

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,920
what you should do instead is you should

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,660
think about extremely carefully what the

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,490
situations are in which you need to make

00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,100
a decision and until you need to make a

00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:29,170
decision just don't make a decision keep

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,090
your options open or go with the default

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,530
with the possibility of switching over

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,750
to your plan B but the important thing

00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,340
is you need to be very clear about under

00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,200
what circumstances you might need to

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,580
exercise an option there's a whole bunch

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,040
of very interesting study around this

00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,080
it's extremely valid when you're talking

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,940
about making technical decisions so are

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,880
there some more stuff about that in a

00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,550
sec okay so this is the book if you want

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,990
to learn more about real options magic

00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,900
into the Phoenix project it's called

00:21:52,990 --> 00:22:02,170
commitment by love masts and and Chris

00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:04,960
mats recommended okay next picture mad

00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:10,070
scientist alright mad scientist

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,660
be afraid of bad news okay so being

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,110
afraid of bad news is linked to being

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,660
afraid funnily enough often what's

00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,830
happened to me I've been on a project

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,390
where for whatever reason possibly

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,100
because I didn't exercise real up shins

00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,350
possibly because I went into Sun

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,540
thinking Lee possibly because i made an

00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,980
unwise technology choice or possibly

00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,030
just because you know technology is

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,970
difficult and these things you know

00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,080
things change stuff comes up and the

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,070
situation is come around where I'm

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,500
thinking either while actually we're a

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,740
long way behind we're not going to make

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,420
the deadline things are not going well

00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,950
it's problem with the technology I've

00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,740
made a mistake we commit to some bad

00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:48,050
code we lost a server whatever it is and

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,810
I am afraid to tell the client the bad

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:53,630
news the result of that is I don't get

00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:55,280
told off yay the bad thing about that is

00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,230
well you know what the bad news is still

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,510
there tomorrow and the thing is the bad

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,820
news is worse news tomorrow and the more

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,380
you defer it in the finger crossing

00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,360
wishful thinking hope that stuff will

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,800
get better yeah yeah I know I know we

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,990
are know we're behind on time but if we

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,280
just work an extra kind of let's work

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,170
overnight tonight we'll turn it around

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,790
let's work over the weekend and then

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,680
we'll be back I can't actually or not

00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,760
you're still in a worse position because

00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,830
you came up with something that you

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,210
didn't expect and now not only are you

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,070
further behind you'll really really

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,980
tired I don't know whether any of you

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:27,260
have read the excellent discussion is

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,360
sleek it was on a correr post about her

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,610
estimating time and why estimates are so

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,960
wildly out it's about a person who says

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,300
he's going to walk around the coast of

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,610
California and he looks at the map and

00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,780
he says okay it looks like it's I don't

00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,760
know I dinner with a number i think it

00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,530
looks like it's 300 miles and i can do

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,870
20 miles in a day and therefore all take

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,610
and then they go on the journey and he

00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,380
hurts his first and he realizes it's

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,600
really Wiggly and stuff goes wrong and

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,310
then he work walks through the night if

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,870
you if you haven't read it i really

00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:57,290
recommend you find it just just google

00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,340
for our wires tomates suck quora post or

00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,700
something like that is really easy to

00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:05,360
find shankland so why does this not work

00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,950
so studying the organization John said

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,260
and very interesting guy a lot of quotes

00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,360
from John said and this and this talk

00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:16,430
studying the organization as a system

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:18,220
will certainly reveal bad news so fear

00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,360
takes a terrible toll says demon

00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,210
where the controllers figures on the

00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,230
losses from fear they are enormous

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,000
getting people to express their ideas

00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,580
without fear of repetition requires

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,320
fundamental change so what's the

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,299
antidote the antidote is not to be

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,760
afraid now that might sound ridiculously

00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:37,309
obvious but how many of you have ever

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,549
done skiing okay when you're going

00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:42,230
downhill what do you need to do you need

00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:44,419
to lean forwards right that's pretty

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,669
scary it takes courage it takes

00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:48,649
fearlessness it takes aggressiveness and

00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:50,149
it's actually counterintuitive lean

00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:51,649
forwards when I'm going downhill I'm

00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:53,419
going to fall over you need to do it

00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:55,549
without fear the same is so when you're

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:59,690
working in DevOps you need to lean into

00:24:55,549 --> 00:25:02,419
it lean forward and not be afraid so

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,490
this is from the dune series it's

00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:06,639
literally a fear I recommend that you

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,460
say it every morning and every night I

00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:11,510
must not fear fear is the mind-killer

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,389
fear is the little death that brings

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,370
total obliteration I will face my fear I

00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:18,049
will permit it to pass over me and

00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,350
through me and when it has gone past I

00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,370
will turn the inner eye to see its path

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:26,210
where the fear has gone there will be

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:29,809
nothing only I will remain alright let's

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:33,440
have another one the thumbs the thumbs

00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:35,510
okay call our lightest one okay the

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,200
thumb says there is no value on the

00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:41,299
right so this is the agile manifesto we

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,679
have come to value interactions and

00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:44,240
individuals over processes and tools

00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,010
working software over comprehensive

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,049
documentation customer collaboration

00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,269
over contract negotiation responding to

00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:54,470
change over following a plan there is

00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:56,809
value in the items on the right we value

00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,029
the items on the left more however more

00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:02,269
often than not this is what we get this

00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:03,649
is my manifesto for DevOps ineptitude we

00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,539
are uncovering better ways of

00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:07,820
misunderstanding and misusing a jalar

00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:09,889
principles by doing it wrong and helping

00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,269
others to do it wrong Zuri this work

00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:13,309
we've come to conclude that we should

00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:15,100
have mandatory DevOps tools to enforce

00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:17,179
individuals and interactions

00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:20,779
infrastructure as code with little or no

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:23,360
documentation naive trust supported by

00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,830
hand wavy verbal agreements and no plan

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,039
at all because we're lean and agile

00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:29,870
hipsters that is while there is wisdom

00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:31,490
in the agile manifesto we fail to

00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,210
understand this essence and

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,650
mented a botched mockery in its place

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,120
I've been guilty of that I'll I've been

00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,380
doing agile for a long time now I

00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,580
haven't made mistakes myself directly

00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,170
but what I haven't done is been

00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,550
responsible for people that I've worked

00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,170
with to make sure they're not making

00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:52,700
those mistakes themselves I haven't had

00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:53,840
enough interaction and enough seeding of

00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,490
good ideas to make sure that people

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,730
don't make those dumb mistakes and

00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:01,130
identifying when they happen so here's

00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,290
some antidotes I'm thinking specifically

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,850
about using chef and using puppet you

00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,710
need to be doing this and a BD to your

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,300
TDD way that is you need to make sure

00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,490
you've got test harnesses around what

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,380
you do and i would recommend that you do

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,330
a test first now i recommend that you

00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,820
think about doing it in a behavior

00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,320
driven away as well documentation is

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,570
really important if your code is good

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,190
it's fair to say you don't need a lot of

00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:24,200
documentation because you look at the

00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,420
puppet manifests or the chef recipes you

00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,010
can kind of see how it works but you do

00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,540
still need to document news cases and

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,420
you need to document why you made those

00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,280
decisions don't do no documentation you

00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,860
already talked about real options that

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,000
means that you do need to make a plan

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,200
but you need to make sure that you are

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,690
aware of your options and you're keeping

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,920
them open and then there's a concept of

00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,290
deliberate discovering the deliberate

00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,570
discovery is very interesting how many

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:50,990
of you have ever been on a project which

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:54,140
failed or took far far far too long okay

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,580
cool let's pick one how persons somebody

00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,890
put your hands up ee who put your hands

00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,570
up but do your hand up again okay uh

00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:06,740
I'll on how long did your project take

00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:08,240
ten months okay if you knew now what you

00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,920
knew through that 10-month period and

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:16,940
you're going to do the project again how

00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:18,740
long do you think it would take yet half

00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:25,640
the time so five months okay what was

00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:29,030
the difference hindsight yeah knowledge

00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,590
knowledge so it turns out that there is

00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,770
a direct correlation between the amount

00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:35,750
you know and the ability to mitigate

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:37,670
against risk or the ability to prevent

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,679
the delay or ensure the success of a

00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:42,380
project that is the more you know the

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,040
more likely you are to succeed now the

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,440
dangerous risk is we don't know what we

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,300
no what deliberate discovery says is

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,860
let's be upfront about that right now on

00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,660
day one and project consumption and

00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,420
let's say what are the areas about which

00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,010
we know nothing how can we find out what

00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,750
we know could we do a spike could we ask

00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,220
some other people could be going talk to

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,720
other people could be getting a room and

00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,610
brainstorm previous projects we've been

00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,690
on could we make a list of possible

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,890
things that could go wrong and then

00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,380
start looking at ways we could mitigate

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:10,480
them from day one the idea of deliberate

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,370
discovery is that you try to find out

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,020
things that will provide you with more

00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,690
knowledge and more information as often

00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,070
as you possibly can and estimates while

00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,990
estimates are waste I don't like

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,310
estimates but of course your

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,830
stakeholders still need to be given

00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:26,200
information as long as you're continuing

00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:28,180
to expand your horizons and no more so

00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,230
that your certainty is increased in your

00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:34,020
risk is decreased on a week-by-week

00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:36,100
basis that's good okay this is my book

00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:38,500
test of infrastructure with chef the

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:42,010
second edition is going to print kind of

00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:44,200
this week so there's lots in there about

00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:49,780
doing infrastructure development test

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:52,780
first okay another picture the tools

00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:54,880
okay this is good i like the tools okay

00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,400
so this is a mistake focus on the tools

00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,750
this is a mistake because quite often as

00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,190
a consultant I've gone in to people's

00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,050
organizations and I have recommended

00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,370
that they should use chef one actually

00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:09,610
wasn't the appropriate tool for them or

00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:11,470
I've gone into an organization and I've

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,820
ripped out there monitoring system like

00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,610
they've got an agarose monitoring system

00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,350
and I go really they're using muninn to

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,780
track the graphs I making oh really and

00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:22,090
so I spend absolutely ages implementing

00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:25,420
something else I gotta know like so

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:28,180
conus or leather sensu or some other

00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,740
cool shiny thing at the end of which

00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,500
I've spent a lot of their time and a lot

00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,240
of their money and guess what they're

00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,310
still monitoring the same thing they're

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,920
still drawing the same graphs are just

00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:41,140
using a different tool I could have

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,210
spent the time using the tool that they

00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,130
already had and solving the problem that

00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,120
they already had which was making sure

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,800
that they were monitoring the right

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,140
thing making sure that they were

00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,330
graphing the right thing and if there

00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,040
was a requirement to change the tool

00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,660
because there was something that they

00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,070
couldn't do with the tool and that's the

00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,830
real problem by all means change the

00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,419
tool

00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:02,450
we talked about this yesterday when we

00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:03,860
were talking about Windows I happen to

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,299
think that Chef is an excellent platform

00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,610
to use for automating Windows

00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:10,010
infrastructure but often case powershell

00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:12,019
is just as good or some combination

00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,880
thereof are being a position where you

00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:15,590
work where the chef up to a certain

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,090
point and then cross over to powershell

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,919
there is no shame in that in fact it's

00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,679
often the right thing to do and the

00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,760
problem when you focus on the tools is

00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:26,899
often you focus on the tools to the

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,669
detriment of the culture so this is a

00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:30,049
this is john said and again John

00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:31,580
sentences a bunch of very interesting

00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:34,659
things this book called freedom from

00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:37,279
command and control John seddon says

00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:39,679
creating the label lean that is what it

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,320
is leads naturally to the notion of

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,240
tools that is how you do it obscuring

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,100
the importance of perspective that is

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,659
how to think about it that's John Sutton

00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:51,470
and if you substitute lean for DevOps

00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:53,570
it's the same thing so he also says if

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:56,720
the object of a change is to change the

00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:59,240
system tools can at best be only an aide

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,620
what does he mean by that he means that

00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,090
the tools are just something which will

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,620
help you to implement the change but the

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,200
change is much more broader much more

00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,730
sweeping than that it also says Before

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,940
we jump to the conclusion that the tools

00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:13,730
will work we had best first study the

00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,200
system because if you're trying to come

00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,220
first with that idea i'm going to do

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,990
devops i'm going to get some tools

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,049
without looking at the broader system an

00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:23,750
important point engineers i do not mean

00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:25,279
the system as in the code and the

00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,169
computers i mean the system as in the

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,419
people the interactions how you work

00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:31,519
with sales the ticketing system the

00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:33,110
sales funnel their marketing dept the

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,440
recruitment everything look at the

00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:39,769
system look at the culture so far tools

00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:47,960
we need culture yes how many people

00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:51,429
agree wrong Adam Jacob very wise dear

00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,289
friend culture alone is hollow posturing

00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:58,070
tooling alone is fiddling in the dark

00:32:54,289 --> 00:33:00,169
right behind culture not tools is great

00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:05,210
any choices I make are good choices

00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:08,990
tools don't matter as also wrong so our

00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:11,149
Dutch computer scientist Dykstra the

00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,750
tools we use have a profound and devious

00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:13,160
influence

00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,810
thinking habits and therefore are not

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,590
thinking ability so tools really do

00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:21,680
matter Adam again in a broken culture

00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:23,480
with a desire to change the tooling can

00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,460
often lead the way to cultural changes

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,850
so we need to balance both tools and

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:32,030
culture so what's the antidote John 7

00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:34,460
again teach perspective how to think of

00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:37,280
the tools help people will beat a path

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:43,100
to the cupboard door so what does that

00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:44,620
look like grow your tools so grow when

00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,550
you're starting a DevOps implementation

00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,560
firstly what's the goal what are we

00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,210
trying to achieve people unite around a

00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,450
purpose what is it that you're actually

00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:55,040
trying to do what's the reality where

00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,660
are you right now what's the Delta

00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,940
between where you want to be and where

00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,740
you are right now what are the options

00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,240
what could you do to bridge the gap

00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,610
between where you want to be and where

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,830
you are right now and finally what will

00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,899
you do think about it make a decision as

00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,790
a team a decision which fits the system

00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,800
a decision which fits the culture which

00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,780
uses the best tools available to you

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,840
within the confines of your abilities

00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:21,740
your experience your culture your budget

00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:24,740
all those things grow your tools start

00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:26,240
while you're at don't dive in fixing

00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,610
things before you need to if you're

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,169
using PHP don't rewrite it and really

00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,580
just because it's cool I had a

00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,540
conversation with a very good friend of

00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,520
mine that have worked with in the past

00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,040
on a couple of projects before just the

00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,480
other day I first thing he said was we

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,980
just fired our CTO and I had of

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,720
development why why is that who said

00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,659
well we made a decision to rewrite the

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,260
application that was in PHP to rewrite

00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:52,330
it in maybe okay fair enough a problem

00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,040
was we didn't have any Ruby developers

00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,149
so we fired all the PHP developers and

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,650
then we had to hire some Ruby developers

00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:59,690
but we couldn't have fire all forward to

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,390
hire good Ruby developers where to hire

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,550
real genius and then we had to hire some

00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,230
consultants to come in to kind of do

00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,730
some stuff as well and then we spent

00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,890
loads of muddy and we ended up

00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,110
implementing something that was actually

00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,450
slower and less reliable than the PHP

00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:17,390
application start while you're at look

00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,680
where you are I'm not saying that PHP is

00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,330
awesome I'm not saying that at all I'm

00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,030
saying that what you have is awesome

00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:24,960
look at it and decide whether or not

00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,980
it's appropriate for you to change

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,200
beware the argument for authority

00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:32,620
because I said so so the argument from

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,980
Authority is when you hear somebody like

00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:38,610
me or Lindsey or John say you should do

00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,660
this I did this or when somebody are

00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:44,110
something really smart has written a

00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:46,300
tool or somebody really really well

00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,130
respected as implemented something just

00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,740
because they did it doesn't mean it's

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,090
right for you now this is most pervasive

00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,400
when it's somebody who you really

00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,990
respect like Adam or Thea what somebody

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,160
like that they've written something and

00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,680
you think wow they're they're really

00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,790
smart again they wrote that therefore it

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,950
must be good but the trouble is they're

00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,330
not you and you'll probably find that

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,830
you implement something and it doesn't

00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,880
it work exactly the way you want and it

00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,990
costs you a lot of time and a lot of

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,300
money that wasn't mean it was badly

00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:12,160
written software if you go and speak to

00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,660
the people who wrote it and say hey this

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,730
thing doesn't behave exactly as I

00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,230
expected why is that you'll probably

00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,730
find them saying I wouldn't do it that

00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,560
way that's just not what I was thinking

00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,790
about when I wrote it so beware the

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,960
argument from Authority just because

00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,310
somebody awesome wrote it or somebody

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,840
awesome used it doesn't mean it's right

00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:36,790
for you okay how are we doing out of the

00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:38,590
kitchen yes okay always say yes so this

00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:41,050
is the mistake where you don't turn away

00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:43,300
business but when somebody says can you

00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:45,760
do it you say yes well somebody says can

00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:49,290
it be fixed you say yes or somebody says

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,790
can you work late and you say yes so

00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,500
this is an article in the Harvard

00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,790
Business Review excellent comic if you

00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,220
are if you don't read it you should it's

00:36:54,790 --> 00:37:00,130
full of excellent stuff there's an

00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,770
article there about saying sm name and

00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:04,210
the title says people who can't say no

00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,860
spend their very limited time and

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,600
already tanks energy on other people's

00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:10,270
priorities while their own priorities

00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,890
fall to the wayside well this counts for

00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,780
you personally but it also counts you in

00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,760
business as well if you always say yes

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,410
you're being driven by somebody else is

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,520
tuned and that's not necessarily what

00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:22,720
you want so you need to look out very

00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:25,180
carefully so a quote from me if you

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,200
sense that this can't be done or you

00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,510
sense that it's going to be very

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,850
expensive or you sense that basically

00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:33,340
you're not the right person to do it if

00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:35,440
you think it looks like it's going to be

00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,509
slow and expensive it probably will be

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,569
slow and expensive

00:37:37,509 --> 00:37:42,579
and someone has to pay if you're not

00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:45,039
transparent about that the chances are

00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:48,579
you'll pay yourself with lost profit

00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:50,859
lost reputation or lost health and in my

00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:54,159
case all three so don't automatically

00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:56,289
say yes so what's the antidote the

00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,389
antidote is to practice saying no and

00:37:56,289 --> 00:38:00,849
saying there was difficult but here are

00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:03,939
nine practices from Peter Bradman's

00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:05,319
article so firstly know you're no get

00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:06,939
comfortable with saying though know why

00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,219
you're saying though work from your

00:38:06,939 --> 00:38:11,739
principles work from where you actually

00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:13,569
believe the appreciative if somebody's

00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:15,099
asking you to do something if somebody's

00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:16,929
offering you business and you say no

00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:19,239
thank you very much I appreciate the

00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:21,999
offer but unfortunately i need to say

00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:23,559
know how to say no to the crest not to

00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:25,149
the person this is a person you're

00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:27,699
dealing with you need to be very careful

00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:31,029
with their feelings but you do need to

00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:32,919
say no no I cannot do that thing that

00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:34,419
you asked me to do explain why the

00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:36,369
reason I can't do that is because I

00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:38,169
think I don't have the time to do that I

00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:39,969
don't have the skills to do that I'm

00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:43,359
sorry I don't think that we can fix this

00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:44,739
I think is too difficult he is resolute

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,959
to thier pushy when you say no people

00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:48,609
will try to convince you all go on go on

00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:50,229
I've ever been in situation where you've

00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:51,609
gone out for a few drinks and you said

00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:54,459
to yourself from front you know arm I

00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:56,409
only gonna have three and then somebody

00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:58,149
says oh come on don't be boring stick

00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:59,349
around have another drink and you say no

00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:02,139
not really i've got to go I've gotta go

00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:04,329
now what happens they say oh go on come

00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,889
on guys are we so boring and they pushed

00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:08,589
and they push and you push you must be

00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:10,689
as resolute as they are pushy when you

00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:12,699
say no you must practice it's hard

00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:14,109
saying they practice saying no get

00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:16,869
people to ask you stuff and say no

00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:18,880
practice your script practice your John

00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:20,109
I really appreciate you asking me I want

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,519
you to understand that I would love to

00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:23,289
do this for you but right now I just

00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,689
don't have the ability or the time or

00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:27,099
the money or whatever it is establish a

00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:28,749
pre-emptive know if you think somebody's

00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:29,859
going to ask you for something if it

00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:31,479
looks like you're going to be asked to

00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:32,859
do something for example the project is

00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:34,959
running late and you think your boss is

00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:36,789
going to come and ask you to work go and

00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:38,529
speak to them early and say look I know

00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:40,419
the project is running late I know that

00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:42,699
we're late on such-and-such I need to

00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:45,309
tell you that if you ask me to work late

00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:46,749
i'm going to say no and then be prepared

00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:47,979
to miss out sometimes you're going to

00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:49,179
miss out on deals sometimes you're going

00:39:47,979 --> 00:39:50,930
to miss that an option sometimes you're

00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:52,880
gonna miss out on exciting things

00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:56,390
but you need to say no gather your

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,430
courage and say no I here's the other

00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:00,319
thing as a consultant as a person who

00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:04,040
makes their living from selling services

00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:06,530
a trusted advisor walks away from money

00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,869
if there's no mutual benefit big thumbs

00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,819
up to John who introduced me to Sandler

00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:13,400
Sandler has a an excellent book called

00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:14,900
you can't teach a kid to ride a bike at

00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,859
a seminar if you haven't read the book

00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,960
you should read it it's an excellent

00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:20,450
book but the whole principle behind it

00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,770
is that in a sales conversation this is

00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,660
a mutual benefit thing you have a

00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:26,599
problem I have a solution we will dance

00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:28,640
together and if I can solve your problem

00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:29,920
and you pay me for us then we've helped

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,200
each other out it's a mutual

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,550
hand-holding supportive agreement if I'm

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,170
trying to sell you my services and

00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:38,300
they're not right for you I'm not a

00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,190
trusted advisor if I take your money so

00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,569
as a consultant or as a person who's

00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,369
going to be hired or whatever the

00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:45,290
situation is a trusted advisor walks

00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:52,430
away from money if there's no mutual

00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:53,630
benefit okay next picture okay do we

00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,549
have time for one more picture have it

00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,730
done all of them is it go dye think it's

00:40:55,549 --> 00:41:01,220
only go team was the path to quality or

00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:03,589
hmm a quick one okay well I can go

00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,420
through them quickly I think this one

00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:08,690
here this one here is just don't build a

00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,069
dev ops team okay don't do that super

00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,119
super quickly don't build the develops

00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:14,119
team because the devil to team is

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,010
another silo okay work out how you can

00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,750
work within your own current

00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,369
circumstances okay if we get time to

00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:21,829
skim through it maybe we could do a

00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:24,470
living spaces on on don't build the dev

00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:27,530
ops team this one's really important

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:29,770
abandon the bath to quality this is

00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:31,700
because a lot of us who build software

00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,230
especially a lot of us who right

00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,020
infrastructure code and puppet or chef

00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:37,609
or ansible or whatever it is we we do so

00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,079
without actually testing it properly

00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:41,329
without going through a proper QA

00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,500
process because partially because often

00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:44,630
we're not really developers we don't

00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,940
know what we're doing and also because

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,650
we have this kind of agile thing which

00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,809
says well you know we don't really do

00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:54,049
long planning and QA and stuff like that

00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:55,730
that spit crap so what is quality

00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:57,109
qualities meeting or exceeding the

00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,910
expectations of the consumer of the

00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:01,700
customer this is just about Nigel not

00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,230
working so another quote brahmi untested

00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,130
and unreviewed infrastructure code is

00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,020
akin to running

00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,390
nations railways on untested and

00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:10,460
incompatible track points and signals

00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,960
it's not a wise thing to do but lots of

00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,290
us do how many of you right

00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,700
infrastructure code chef and puppet okay

00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:20,080
how many of you have a fully functional

00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:24,890
suite of tests surrounded alright that's

00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:27,620
almost nobody okay so the antidote and

00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:29,510
this is really powerful stuff are the

00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,770
antidote to this is actually the way you

00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:33,170
need to do develops throughout your

00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,630
organization which is you need to set

00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,040
the potion on on intrinsic motivation

00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,260
make sure that you're doing things

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,850
because you believe in the project and

00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,430
because you care about software as a

00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,990
craft because you care about building

00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,990
software which is good because you care

00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:49,430
about meeting your customers objectives

00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:51,950
think about master you think about

00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:53,360
becoming a master of your trade think

00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:54,590
about the process of becoming master

00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,580
fuel trade if you want to be a master of

00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:57,830
your traders and infrastructure

00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,210
developing you need to write tests if

00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,740
you want to do that you will do it if

00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,270
you want to be a master of Judo you will

00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,980
practice if you want to be a master of

00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,270
an instrument to your practice if you

00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,730
want to be a master of an infrastructure

00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:10,130
but you'll do the same non-violence I'll

00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:12,500
cover in just a second and autonomy I

00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:18,710
think we're probably very short of time

00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:21,890
but I just want to cover the nonviolent

00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:23,240
communication stuff so the nonviolent

00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,890
communication stuff is what I'm going to

00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,600
finish on because this applies to every

00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:28,520
relationship you have with your friends

00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,890
and your family with your co-workers but

00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,690
it's also functions organizationally and

00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:34,370
what this stems from is belief the human

00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:37,190
beings as a whole are compassionate

00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:39,920
beings so I like to love you like to

00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,570
love I like to receive love you like to

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,000
perceive love and we are programmed to

00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:46,220
do so so we need to tune our language

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,620
and we need to tune our communication so

00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,200
as to be compassionate and loving what

00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,730
that means is we need to work out how

00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,140
organizationally and personally we can

00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:58,520
get what really matters without using

00:43:54,140 --> 00:44:00,620
guilt humiliation shame lame coercion or

00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,510
threats I recommend you read this book

00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,910
nonviolent communication by Rosenberg

00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:06,350
but what it basically says is that in

00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:08,090
all circumstances when you have a

00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:09,950
conversation especially when you're

00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:12,410
expressing a need or when you're feeling

00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:14,360
anger or pain or any of those things you

00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:16,580
need to follow this path firstly you

00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,950
observe that is you state what is

00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,820
happening you don't interpret it

00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:25,839
you state what is happening Lindsay when

00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:29,530
you when you said to me that we were

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:31,810
going to leave at eight thirty but you

00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:35,800
stayed on a conference call until nine

00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:38,109
o'clock I felt frustrated I felt

00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,690
frustrated because I need to feel

00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:42,190
prepared and relaxed and to have had

00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:45,700
some coffee and maybe some food before

00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:49,599
the talk begins so I would ask that next

00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:52,720
time that we share room together you

00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,400
would maybe be explicit with me about

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,140
the possibility that your conference

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,700
call might run on so that I can be

00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,260
prepared for the possibility that we

00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:02,349
might be running late that's a made-up

00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,359
story I as just not a made-up story but

00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:06,070
I didn't have those feelings that did

00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:10,960
happen this morning but but I didn't

00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:12,640
have those feelings so so so I didn't

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,349
really have these feelings but if I did

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,000
have those feelings rather than sink

00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:18,490
 sake Lindsay why didn't you do

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,839
this then I should say that thing and

00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,250
you should practice that process and

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,770
it's all wrapped in the concept of

00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:26,829
empathy very powerful and very important

00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:30,579
stuff this is actually a slide from the

00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:33,010
deck which Asha shared which is

00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:34,869
extremely important about alignment and

00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:36,160
autonomy which comes back to how can you

00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:37,359
make sure that we're doing the right

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,310
thing how can you be sure that we're

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:42,819
building quality software without

00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:44,650
enforcing it on people so practically

00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:47,380
you should pair program as often as you

00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:50,109
can you should practice TDD and be DD

00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:53,319
and you should practice peer review ok I

00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:56,319
don't think we have any more time but as

00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:58,900
Lindsay said if you appreciate it what I

00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,790
said please tell me so via via Twitter

00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:03,550
I'd love to see it come and give me your

00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:06,280
feedback as well I'm at Lord's cope at

00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:08,650
Lord copado rd co PE at Lord cope on

00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,710
Twitter I'd love to hear from you thank
