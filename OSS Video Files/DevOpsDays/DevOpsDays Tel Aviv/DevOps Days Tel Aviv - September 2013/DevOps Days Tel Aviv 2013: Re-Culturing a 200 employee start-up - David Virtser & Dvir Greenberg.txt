Title: DevOps Days Tel Aviv 2013: Re-Culturing a 200 employee start-up - David Virtser & Dvir Greenberg
Publication date: 2013-10-24
Playlist: DevOps Days Tel Aviv - September 2013
Description: 
	In this session, Dvir and David will present how eToro, the world's largest Social Investment Network, embarked on the DevOps journey. A year ago, they had a great product, market and vision, but no automation in place, marginal contribution from new developers, and scalability and stability problems. Today, they are in the early phases of implementing devops practices within the company, which is a work in progress. Employees are already a lot more knowledgeable, and there are a few preliminary Success stories they can share. Come and hear how to start a journey whose vision people cannot even understand, and how to make them part of this vision.

Speaker:

Dvir Greenberg and David Virtser, eToro

Dvir serves as the VP of product operations at eToro and David as the devops leader at eToro, and together they're pushing the devops revolution within eToro and trying to optimize it, make it faster and more scalable.

my name is Devere I'm vp product

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,490
operations in the Toro my experiences in

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:23,160
product management operations as a

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:27,119
developer development management and a

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:30,750
lot of experience in operations not only

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:35,040
in software companies and with me is

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,410
daveed hi my name is David I am

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,040
currently leading the DevOps efforts in

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:47,460
the Torah I am an R&D manager and web

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:49,710
programmer so we want to tell you a bit

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,700
about the journey we've been heading in

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,970
the last year and as you can see it's

00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,280
not a very small organization anymore so

00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:03,900
recapturing it and moving into develops

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,659
is a challenge a few words about it or

00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:10,469
oh we're in the junction of the internet

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:14,009
and the finance world we're bringing

00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:18,119
finance to the area of social networks

00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:20,939
and our main product is something that

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:25,140
probably many of you would always want

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,170
always wanted to have who's here is

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,969
investing his money in some ways

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:36,450
actively I bet that everyone that is

00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:38,729
doing it is always thinking oh how could

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:43,159
I do better how could I learn from

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,810
others and what we offer in eToro is a

00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,719
social network of investments where

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,299
everybody can see what everybody else is

00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,270
doing their gains the risk their

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,329
investment profile of course all the

00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,469
history of their success and failures

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:04,829
and then you can choose those that are

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,950
the best and copy them so if you see

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,800
that David is doing great you can put a

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,670
hundred dollars or a thousand or more on

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,890
him and whatever

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,280
whatever he will do will happen the same

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:21,150
in your account so if he bought gold or

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,770
Apple for two percent of his portfolio

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,709
two percent of your thousand dollars

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,780
that you invested in him will be bought

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:32,170
in your account with the same rates and

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,890
we actually do we we actually see that

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:39,280
it goes great we see that investors that

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:42,970
copy others are doing much much better

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,959
than investors that are just manually

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:49,300
picking their investments so this is

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,230
about our product it's going very well

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,209
and now for the challenges that we

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:59,620
understood that we have to take in the

00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:05,980
recent year we have about 100,000 active

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:08,230
investors 220 employees about a third of

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:15,069
them are engineers I mean in the broad

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:17,320
sense of DB AIT developers QA etc we

00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:20,350
have two main platforms one is the

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,470
trading system and one is the social

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,230
investment network our open book that's

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:32,470
how we call it and those platforms come

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:38,079
in different products different handsets

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:41,320
and devices we have around 120 services

00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:43,870
code services will probably have much

00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:47,829
much more once we'll go with a good

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:50,850
service oriented architecture we do

00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:55,200
about when he releases per week that's

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:58,180
much more than we did until recently and

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,989
we were a windows shop which calls for

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:05,859
some challenges especially as you scale

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:08,410
up and very important as a finance

00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:13,180
company as a finance institution we are

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:15,100
regulated and regulation is is both a

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,829
pro and a cone like everything in life

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,540
it means we have to invest lots of money

00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:24,780
we have to do many things

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,540
in a certain way we can not go to the

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,540
cloud with everything we do but it also

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,690
means that our competition has a bigger

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:38,030
barrier in order to try and do what we

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:42,090
do and that's the cone about it and

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:45,390
DevOps is a journey if you start as a

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:49,470
big company not not so big but 200 is

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:51,240
enough it's it's a journey and with

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,770
every journey you have to be brave and

00:04:51,240 --> 00:05:01,110
the old Greek said it a long time before

00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:10,140
fortune favors the bold so now for more

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:14,550
details with the vid q so our story

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:18,120
begins about a year ago when we actually

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,880
felt that we are really inefficient and

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,420
have a lot of bottlenecks okay it's

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,620
actually a item our CEO who tries to

00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:32,400
fight the inefficient our problems are

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,830
big static environments one big

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,710
environment of the whole ecosystem of

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:41,220
literal services which are built

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:46,380
completely manually for dev QA and

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:48,060
production environments if we have

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,110
problems during deployment or

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,810
configuration errors it can take hours

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:59,820
or even days of developers to try and

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:02,490
fix them we used to have very long

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:06,060
iterations of weeks sometimes even

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:09,930
months we used to work in waterfall

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:16,310
methodology and it's very unpredictable

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:20,790
and risky we have a lot of deployment

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:24,030
problems things break we don't

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:28,890
understand why we like monitoring tools

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:31,620
I used to manage a team of eight people

00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,450
about a year ago and by taking two

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,430
people out of the team we actually

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,640
proved that

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:44,470
Dean efficiently team efficiency

00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:48,470
increase and after we realize our

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:51,260
problems we still still didn't know how

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,530
to fix how to fix them how to deal with

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:57,530
them and about a year ago winds of

00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:02,060
change I call it winds of change started

00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:07,450
to came to be thorough as part of it we

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:09,980
switch from waterfall to to scrum scrum

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:12,710
formalizes much better the development

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:17,170
process and gives great transparency to

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:20,690
the process by by itself it's not enough

00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:24,860
about half year ago at the beginning of

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:27,890
the year we had our first Ito Rakatan

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,710
which was an amazing experience small

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:35,240
teams could deliver great products in

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:38,180
just 48 hours could build great products

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,530
but the a curtain also expose our

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:45,290
problems of static environments and

00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:49,460
think that we can't we actually quickly

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:52,490
deliver products to production we

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:56,890
started to learn what others doing we

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:59,120
met Facebook engineers which who

00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:03,950
explained about their development

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,200
process we met our local guys from weeks

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:11,150
and Outbrain to learn how they do

00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:14,120
continuous delivery we read lots of

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,230
materials and internet which we started

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:22,460
to visit conferences like the ropes days

00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:25,820
and after we realized our problems and

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:29,780
so how others cope with with them and

00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:32,210
what is DevOps we actually decided to

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:37,520
establish a DevOps forum in the company

00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:42,080
a form of 56 key people from different

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:46,790
departments in R&D and we took few of

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,810
sites to discuss our problems we started

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:53,630
to map

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:56,330
our Gibbs this is the least there there

00:08:53,630 --> 00:09:01,450
there was a lot of problems we knew

00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:01,450
about even more which didn't knew about

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:11,390
we think how to tackle the problems and

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,970
close the gaps we set an action plan we

00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:19,520
build the phases to club to close the

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:25,279
gaps photo the recruitment plan and try

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:29,600
to give some ETS to the phases we even

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:33,290
think of making a full stop for a few

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,300
few months in a Torah or indeed we

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:39,950
stopped without features at all just to

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:44,600
to close the gaps and minimize the

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:48,920
technical depth we presented the plan to

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,410
our management this step is crucial you

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,650
must get management support to to

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:57,020
proceed and to go on the full stop

00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:02,720
wasn't accepted by the management of

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:05,510
course the business must go on we

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,520
decided to recruit to build and

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:10,210
recruiting you completely new team we

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,190
call it dev ops team which I lead

00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:16,100
currently the team was established for a

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:20,300
ramp-up period to minimize the technical

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:25,790
debt it's a team of professionals from

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:29,690
different fields and its purpose was

00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:32,140
actually to bring the DevOps culture to

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:35,480
organization to start automate things

00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:42,730
automating things establish new tools

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,730
monitoring tools continuous delivery etc

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,420
we define few DevOps kpi's we still

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,900
struggle to with defining this KP as

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,610
it's a real challenge but it's important

00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:59,690
step to do as

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:02,200
have to explain about the DevOps

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:05,120
progress to the whole organization and

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:11,779
people who are not technically not to

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:16,010
understand it we started to work on the

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:21,160
cultural change few examples of new

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:24,350
versus old culture in the old culture

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:28,040
product design feature developers

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,800
developed QA tested IT deploy and

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:35,290
monitored in the new architect in the

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:38,350
new culture sorry and we are team with

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,890
shelters of responsibilities and

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:44,980
developers actually responsible of

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:49,279
technical design developing testing

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:54,470
deploying and monitoring another example

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:58,760
of new versus old culture in the old

00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:01,730
culture product is a set of features in

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,350
the new culture product is a service

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:11,060
which is a combination of features

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:13,610
support quality and performance as part

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:18,440
of our cultural changes we started to

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:22,339
discuss about focus we started to invest

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:25,880
more and more time and efforts in our

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:28,250
core business values and started to kill

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:32,920
services which are out of focus and just

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:36,230
waste our time we talk a lot about

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,959
self-service things like creating a

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,930
virtual machine or setting a new metric

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,110
in our monitoring system still requires

00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:50,089
an IT person to do it things which can

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:53,420
be automated and can be given to

00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:55,430
developers as a cell service even

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,310
installing a mouse or a keyboard now

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:03,339
requires help this person to come to

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:06,970
your desk and installed we introduced

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:09,320
freestyle Tuesdays Tuesday's in it or

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:14,440
or3 day three

00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:19,820
iteration a day where engineers can

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:21,740
learn new things review their logs see

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:25,520
how they can improve their applications

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:30,230
automate things and stuff like that we

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:32,480
used it at the beginning as a as a ramp

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,760
up to to learn what to learn our

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:45,020
developers what is unit testing how they

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:50,390
do any testing let's do it a 10 thank

00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:55,490
you we establish the dev Academy it's

00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:58,550
actually a set of lectures where any

00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:02,780
developer can or not known on developer

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:09,070
any engineer can volunteer and present a

00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:13,610
topic he is experiencing we started to

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:16,340
do boot camps for new employees we just

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,890
sit with the employee and explain about

00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:22,490
the Torah about how development process

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:25,700
works which tools do you use stuff like

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,940
that we started to give more power to

00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,190
developers to increase their

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,200
responsibilities we give them direct

00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:37,280
access to production to see their

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:44,270
application running production to review

00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:48,650
their logs we invest more and more

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:51,770
information we recruit few automation

00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:57,830
experts and did some training to our

00:14:51,770 --> 00:15:01,300
current existing Qi personnel we started

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:04,520
to automate regressions api testing

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:09,050
developers as i said the investing unit

00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:12,230
testing integration test we decided to

00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:15,830
recruit only professionals full-stack

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:22,730
developers we believe they're there

00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:27,190
our way is much higher as part of our

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:31,310
review we saw a lot of problems of

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:35,090
collaboration between Crossley teams and

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:38,720
the part of these we decided to review

00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:40,910
our architectures we are we are talking

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,690
about our software architecture system

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:48,590
architecture we are talking about

00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:51,920
service-oriented architecture and we

00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:55,400
review our big more one big monolithic

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:59,870
database policy and started to break it

00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:02,630
to smaller databases we build more and

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:08,840
more standard restful api eyes to

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:12,340
encapsulate our resources we are working

00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:16,970
to establish a new infrastructure team

00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:19,070
just just a team of developers who build

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:25,340
the common models and tools for

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:27,920
development we started almost from

00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:31,000
scratch to build our continuous

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,580
integration and continuous delivery and

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:41,090
me and while we do continuous disaster

00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:43,550
and continuous robic we still that it's

00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:47,030
all we still feel that it's only the

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:50,480
beginning for us and we are just

00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:53,240
learning to work but we also feel that

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,080
the devops train has left the station

00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:01,820
for us and it's either you hop on it or

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:05,860
you stay behind and this is our progress

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,860
tinley in the last four months

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:17,580
and now do we will continue with the

00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,580
summary

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,350
ok and the vid said that the train left

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,809
the station but it's the Middle East so

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:41,570
we still don't know when it will get to

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:44,240
its destination the problem that we

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:47,090
handled was that everything was very

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,970
slow we also had production problems but

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:52,429
things are very slow and what we need to

00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,500
remember that it's not that you always

00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:57,409
have to use the same tools as in the

00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,139
past so if things are slow and you just

00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:03,470
tell people ok work harder work faster

00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:06,649
work more it doesn't necessarily mean

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,809
that you will gain what you need and as

00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:12,049
it's written here if you're on the edge

00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:18,500
of a cliff step forward might not be the

00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:21,440
best action to do small batches for me

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,260
small batches is the one of the very

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,389
very basics of everything that we do

00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:31,899
around DevOps it's the same thing in

00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:36,789
lean in theory of constraints in many

00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:40,130
operational in many theories of

00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:42,519
operations whenever you go to an

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,500
operation that produces something

00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:48,740
inventory is something that kills them

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,840
the organization and if you have big

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:55,760
batches you have inventory if you have

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:59,000
inventory it get messed up it's not

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,549
relevant after a while you cannot do

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,240
things fast enough to react to needs and

00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:07,399
to the market so inventory for this and

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,580
for many other reasons is a great evil

00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:13,850
and small batches reduce inventory and

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:18,080
the problem I always had when I worked

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:20,750
with the operations in in software

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,120
development was that when it's not a

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,970
software development it's quite easy to

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,120
do small batches because you produce the

00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,889
same thing all the time but in software

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,480
development it's a cold and it's a

00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:35,559
different code every time so how the

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,289
hell do you do very small batches and

00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,710
that the main thing that DevOps brings

00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:43,940
to the table it

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:47,220
the ability to do continuous delivery

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,960
which means small batches and all the

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,510
automation of the testing and the

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,850
monitoring around it really allows you

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:58,950
to do what you could not do some years

00:19:53,850 --> 00:20:09,559
before returning on here I heard of

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:15,090
Danvers number how much is it about yeah

00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:17,669
150 to 200 at least for human for Apes

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:20,789
it's probably around fifty so what's

00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:23,640
done verse number Denver's number is

00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:30,570
accounting for the number of people that

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:32,880
we as humans or Apes Apes can main can

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:38,159
retain a connection of a social

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:41,520
connection so think of a community of 20

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,940
people everyone knows each other usually

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,909
there are no crimes they feel as friends

00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:51,440
they know exactly what it means what

00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:55,260
everyone is good at and less good at etc

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:59,220
you grow up to 100 it still works but if

00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:01,799
you're in the city of 100,000 or even in

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,980
a bigger village of a thousand it's not

00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,630
working anymore people do not mind to

00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,179
hurt each other because they don't

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,460
really know them they don't really

00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,470
understand even that they hurt them it's

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,230
the same with by the way there are

00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:21,390
communities in the world that once they

00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:22,860
go up to 150 or 200 they split and half

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,549
the community stays and half the

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:29,669
community goes somewhere else so in

00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:33,260
companies it's the same that's the main

00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:38,309
reason why you feel so different in your

00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:40,320
100 200 people the organization unlike

00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:42,990
what it was when it was three people and

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,049
20 people it's not that people are bad

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:49,289
suddenly it's just that it's we're not

00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:51,840
meant to live in an organization of 200

00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:52,620
people and really know exactly what

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,410
everyone

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:58,980
is doing and now everyone will react to

00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:01,440
everything you can break the

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,110
organization into two and by the way

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,320
there are companies that are doing it

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:10,500
but you can also work differently and

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:14,940
the DevOps practices actually allow

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:17,550
small teams to work independently create

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,650
api's monitor what they're doing be

00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,690
responsible end to end but on a small

00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,710
piece of what's happening in the

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:27,809
organization and thus allow a bigger

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,940
organization to exist without everyone

00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:34,140
needing to interact with each other all

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:38,490
the time so if you start feeling

00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:43,559
problems around 120 people Denver is the

00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:47,370
reason so things to remember we're about

00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:51,179
the size of where Dunbar is suggesting

00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:52,620
to split things up or change them we

00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,640
have massive changes to do in

00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:59,550
architecture and in our culture we have

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,500
to do it while the organization still

00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:04,380
works and still growing and it's growing

00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:08,820
very nicely all the time during those

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:11,220
changes we identify dark in meta sports

00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,170
as those cultural changes but especially

00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,730
at the start to get the management

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:19,679
support it's slow it's never fast you

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:23,790
can never predict the beginning how a

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:26,760
lot how long it will take exactly the

00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:30,360
many unknowns will reveal as you go and

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,460
you will solve them as you go you must

00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,780
define and goes but revisit them all the

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:39,480
time and it was spoken many times here

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,640
the people on the bus are really what

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,890
matters because you don't really know

00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,410
where the bus is going so you need the

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,890
best people there to decide where it

00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:54,450
should go at every point in time and

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:57,540
this is the what we usually perceive of

00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,790
success a straight road to success this

00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:04,080
is probably what it is their ups and

00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:06,490
downs and as long as you know what your

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,150
end goal and you and in the big

00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:11,890
a term of things in the wider scope you

00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:23,470
feel that you really go there then

00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:26,110
everything is okay thank you all right

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,000
I'll make it short my question is do

00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,490
developers actually use the Freestyle

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,770
Tuesdays or do they I mean to do

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:35,470
innovative or in you know out-of-the-box

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:39,340
things or do they keep you know keep the

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:42,190
time to work on the usual projects okay

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:46,570
so actually we presented the Tuesday's

00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:49,570
even before we start we recruited the

00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:53,050
dev ops team okay we the purpose of

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:56,470
these days is not to develop new cool

00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:58,720
things in the environment which is not

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:02,290
supporting developing new coupe new cool

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:09,850
things ok the purpose of these days was

00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:14,730
to to learn how get to DevOps culture ok

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:19,390
it was a lot of talks and discussions

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:22,960
what what why developers should be

00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:26,260
responsible and to end to their group of

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,100
their code what is unit testing why do

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:36,280
they need to do in testing how they

00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:40,990
learn it monitoring tools it's in it's

00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:44,410
just for for the ramp up and it didn't

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:47,760
work in all teams very well because big

00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:50,830
teams with the way they are trations

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,190
struggle to you know to stop in the

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:59,950
middle of the week and continue after

00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:03,570
that but nobody to work it it gives time

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:10,150
for developers to do some extra things

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:13,690
things that are not features I let

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:16,350
something we really wish those tuesdays

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:20,320
to become innovation

00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:23,860
we feel that what we need right now is

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:27,190
not the innovation is the DevOps so

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:31,360
people use this time most of them really

00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:34,900
do and it's really about the things that

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,170
everyone is saying oh I must learn how

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:40,840
to use this monitoring tool I want to

00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:44,470
read this part of this book and I want

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,750
to search to Google some ways to do some

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,730
things i know i need to do but i never

00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,980
have time for this and it's not in half

00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:54,460
an hour I can do at night I really need

00:26:50,980 --> 00:27:02,230
few hours to do it and Tuesday is the

00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:05,490
answer the question was whether the

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:11,580
content of those free tuesdays is a

00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:14,020
known monitored and tracked first of all

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,280
the important thing is that the

00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:20,230
iteration planning of the known

00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:24,190
developments is not including Tuesday so

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:26,320
if like we do we usually go for two

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:30,610
weeks iterations sometimes three in some

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:35,110
teams those two weeks iterations mean

00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:38,740
four days of work in each week about the

00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:41,320
last day it varies from team to team in

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,680
some teams every team member can choose

00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:47,170
whatever is doing and just put it to in

00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,960
our case to Trello and everybody else

00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:53,080
can see and share what others were doing

00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,360
in other teams it's more United and the

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,340
team leader is sitting with the team and

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,160
together they decide where they will

00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,320
focus about in the next few weeks this

00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,650
one will learn a new tool this one will

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,190
do some logging they were missing for a

00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:12,940
lot of time and very important about

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:15,910
those Tuesdays it's changing its agile

00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,770
it's not something that this is the way

00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,890
we do it and this is the way we will do

00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:23,320
it forever in every team it changes over

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,450
time to accommodate for what the team

00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,270
really needs the important thing is that

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,530
there is this vacant time to do things

00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,590
that are the

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:37,120
and what management needs now product

00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:43,660
needs now what's urgent now more

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:47,280
questions the thing is that really

00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:50,740
stopping everything is not always

00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:54,610
practical because you may say you want

00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:57,310
to do it but it's not a reality when the

00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:00,370
daily things come you just need to do

00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:05,680
things and you cannot even plan half a

00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:07,960
year ahead what you'll do so we also

00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,140
understood what that we don't know

00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,660
enough about what this change means in

00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,180
order to stop everything now and start

00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:18,730
climbing this mountain we have to start

00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,830
climbing this mountain slowly main thing

00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:24,040
was to bring many people to bring some

00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:25,810
no house we did not have or even ask the

00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:31,420
questions we did not know to ask

00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:33,700
ourselves so we just currently pile up

00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,820
those things and have those initial

00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:40,030
success stories and as we'll go we'll

00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,280
probably have some stop somewhere so in

00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:44,350
this team they will stop for a month and

00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,600
do only things about it and then in

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:49,240
another team and maybe sometimes in few

00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,550
things but we understood we need to make

00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:56,010
a better ramp up because before we can

00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:59,950
go to to this stage and management

00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:04,150
management is about the end goes at the

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:06,670
end so as long as you go by the way what

00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:10,540
I learned in the process is not to call

00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:14,170
things let's stop doing this and do that

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:16,530
because everyone will just work harder

00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:20,830
once will go with the dev of change so

00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:22,660
what you need to say is we're working

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,330
all the time the only question is to

00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,970
start about the next week's if this

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,210
whole time will be invested in since the

00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:34,470
business must have our things the

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:37,590
infrastructure of the business must have

00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,590
