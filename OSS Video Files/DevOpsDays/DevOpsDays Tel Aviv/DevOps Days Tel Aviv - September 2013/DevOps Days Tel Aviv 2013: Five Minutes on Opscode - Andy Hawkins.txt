good morning yeah very pleased to be in

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:20,430
Tel Aviv just want to give you a really

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:22,410
brief introduction to Opscode so as a

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,670
sysadmin and systems engineer who spent

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,080
15 years trying to build solutions I

00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,599
completely recognize everything John

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,160
said about our founders trying to build

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,070
a solution that actually solved the

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,410
problems 18 we're a leader in software

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,170
delivery automation helping hundreds of

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,579
companies of all sizes solve problems in

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,789
terms of configuration management and

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,160
continuous deployment we provide a

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,780
solution that's available both open

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,809
source many of you may be using it

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,710
already it's also available as a hosted

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,149
and as an on-premise platform the key

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,430
thing for me as somebody that's been

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,489
working in this space for years is the

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,040
power of the community historically you

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,250
buy a product you'd spent hours and

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,360
hours weeks months developing it trying

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,880
to get some content in there the

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,250
community is phenomenal maybe you guys

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,540
are contributing there's just loads of

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,200
stuff out there for us to actually work

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,240
with the day we get our platforms we're

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
firm believers in DevOps almost every

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,720
organization I work with is trying to

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,869
either start or complete a journey to

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,939
become develop centric just too many

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,130
people have been too slow delivering

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,869
applications in the past DevOps is just

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:42,210
so key to what we're doing you may or

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,909
may not know chef is built on an

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,009
approach using cookbooks and recipes

00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:50,000
cookbook so where you define what your

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,530
system should be doing there are really

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,630
cool and reusable approach for you to

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,090
actually create policies that you can

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,770
then push in order to not only stand

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,740
your room for major infrastructure app

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,560
but actually scale it change it deliver

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,079
new services and in many cases fix

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,610
problems after all if a if a machine

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,020
breaks sometimes the quickest way of

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,420
getting back into production is

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,920
reprovision you know the policy was

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,750
built to you've got a great

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,209
cup and recovery mechanism chef is built

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,099
on really three key and simple

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,140
architectural principles you will have a

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,170
developer you'll have an administrator

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,550
who's familiar with writing code they're

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,410
going to be writing your cookbooks or

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,200
acquiring your cookbooks from the

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,819
community acting as a workstation I

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,290
sorry acting as an administrator on

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,930
their workstation they will craft these

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,340
these wonderful objects for you they're

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,680
going to publish them to the chef server

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,840
and then you're going to have reuse

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,970
anybody in your organization can learn

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,739
and use what's been out there and put

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,049
out there for them you get reliability

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,360
systems can be built quickly fixed

00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:57,209
quickly and you can refactor code really

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,459
quickly very very elegant and one of the

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,069
one of the emerging tools is really

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,989
giving you that option to reuse code and

00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:06,239
then you've got a whole lot of machines

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,310
out there that will be actually pulling

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,480
down those configurations and making

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,549
sure that they're in line with your

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,620
policy great for desired state

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,970
configuration management for those of

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,680
you who are trying to improve things or

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,239
you've got some legislation they're also

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,739
great for ensuring that you're in

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,390
compliance with what the law says you've

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,620
got to be and on the internet that can

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,390
be pretty powerful I mentioned a few

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,250
moments ago one of the most significant

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,540
aspects of this new movement is the fact

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,150
that we got a community you're all here

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,160
today the community is contributing not

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,530
only to the product that is chef but

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,150
also to the content and then for many of

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,010
the tools that you're using in

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,350
day-to-day use I've heard people talking

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,390
about nad jos of her people talking

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,130
about databases you'll find that there's

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,410
a cookbook available for you that

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,299
somebody who's quite frankly maybe more

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,549
expert than me maybe more expert than

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,680
you is written you can actually embrace

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:57,810
all of that that coolness in order to

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,579
get your environment setup correctly of

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,350
course you may be super super

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:03,030
knowledgeable in something you can then

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,549
contribute and you can enhance that so

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,780
that your peers other people out there

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,470
in the community can actually benefit

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,329
from that technology to for me the key

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,130
thing now is that we're at the point in

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,950
time where DevOps is just becoming so

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,840
important there are there are just too

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,150
few skilled people out there who have

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,849
got the experience of building complex

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,650
systems unless we start to use the

00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,000
community and start to actually exploit

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,750
some of these DevOps principles we're

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,150
not going to get to

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,700
position where actually the business can

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,560
continue running we're seeing skills

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,020
development is running behind the curve

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,360
we're seeing that more and more because

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,220
of people like Amazon we're seeing the

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,800
consumer wants it now I want it now

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,350
branda loyalties is diminished bring me

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,750
this new application tools let like this

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,940
can actually help you to do that and of

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,740
course the previous speaker talked about

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,500
his lovely machine broken on the desktop

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,940
those still exist but cloud and

00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,890
virtualization have changed the game

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,630
whatever you choose should be able to

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,870
cope with any one or all of those

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,580
different types of operation frankly we

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,640
all need to move faster in order to

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,020
compete obscured and chef is one of the

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,410
approaches that can actually help you to

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,410
