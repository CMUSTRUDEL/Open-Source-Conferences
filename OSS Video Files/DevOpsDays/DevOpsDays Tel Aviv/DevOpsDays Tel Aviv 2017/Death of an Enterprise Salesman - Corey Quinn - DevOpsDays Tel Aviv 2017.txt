thank you all for inviting me here to

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,969
your board meeting although later none

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,610
of you will remember actually having

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,320
extended an invitation don't worry I

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,270
will not stop speaking

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,820
long enough for want someone to ask that

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,230
question you're all familiar with my

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,939
company you've probably seen our

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,580
enterprise software ads strewn across

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,619
various airports they make no sense

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,510
they're copy is terrible and you'll

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,790
notice that there's no link on there

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,800
saying where to buy things that's fine

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,480
the point of these ads is not to

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,550
convince you to go ahead and make a

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,870
purchase it's so that when I'm standing

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,969
here in front of you you feel like

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,700
you've heard of my company hundreds of

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,920
times before and you don't question the

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,170
right legitimacy in standing here before

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,050
you let's talk a look at a diagram of

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,449
what my application actually does I will

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,219
not explain this I will not expand my

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,530
acronyms and if I'm faced with any

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,920
questions I will look at you like you're

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,110
the idiot this is all by design it's not

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,409
for one person to understand it's an

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,060
entire team effort we're not talking

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,710
about boots on the ground implementation

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,290
we're not talking about the 10,000 foot

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,420
view we are looking at a very high level

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,820
view from orbit of the entire strategy

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,729
not just of your company but of the

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,060
industry as a whole that's what we do

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,130
here later I will make the actual sale

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,900
with the man or woman here who is

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,860
actually responsible for making the

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,100
purchase decision

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:36,229
hahaha I'm kidding this is a fortune 500

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,820
of course it's a man why wouldn't it be

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,310
note that my solution will not solve

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,950
your actual problem and that's okay

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,430
that's not what this is about in the

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,820
least

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,490
it's about optics how everything looks

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,979
when the finger of blame comes to point

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,420
at you it doesn't land on you and

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,610
certainly won't land on me because

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,979
you're doing everything right by

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,320
bringing me in and buying the ridiculous

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,170
thing that no one understands that is

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,420
the point of me we are in the right part

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,879
of the Gartner Magic Quadrant we are in

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,370
all of the in-flight magazines that CIOs

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,250
read everywhere if it works terrific if

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,049
doesn't no one is going to blame you for

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,780
bringing me in what's your alternative

00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:22,030
go with some open-source hippie provided

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,099
software or go with one of our

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,129
consulting partners and their legion of

00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:30,579
freshly graduated MBAs who will work 120

00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:32,860
hour weeks while billing for 40 amazing

00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:34,540
what those hippies don't seem to

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,390
understand is that the halls of power

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,010
are greased with favors you'll do

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,260
business with me because I'll do

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,970
business with you in the future that's

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,040
the way all of this works its

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,530
relationship driven it's not about

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,870
capability it's not about whether or not

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,819
we can actually solve the problem it all

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,299
comes down to who is scratching whose

00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:57,790
back we're not here to save the whales

00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:00,159
if that's what you want to do resign

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,040
your board seat and go work for UNICEF

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,760
they do amazing work that's not what

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,709
we're here to do the point is is there

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,290
are two outcomes and you're winners in

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,000
both if this magically somehow solves

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,670
your problem and let me level with you I

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,819
don't see how it could you look like

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,489
visionary heroes if and this is likelier

00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,769
it doesn't solve a thing by the time the

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,810
indictments start flying we'll all be

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,669
long gone and three jobs away and

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,340
someone else will be left holding the

00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:34,030
bag that's the point that's how business

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:36,430
works ladies and gentlemen the time is

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,879
meow there has never been a better time

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,310
to make a decision today to ensure your

00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,139
future unfortunately I will not stay to

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,419
take questions I have another prospect

00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:48,549
who is desperately in need of my goods

00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:50,139
and/or services and I need to get over

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:52,510
there right away to strike while the

00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:55,599
iron is hot but I will think of you

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,699
fondly in fact I will name my yacht that

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,760
I will buy from this deal after your

00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:07,799
company - Rezac persistent reminder that

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,799
you are all c-level executives thank you

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,450
