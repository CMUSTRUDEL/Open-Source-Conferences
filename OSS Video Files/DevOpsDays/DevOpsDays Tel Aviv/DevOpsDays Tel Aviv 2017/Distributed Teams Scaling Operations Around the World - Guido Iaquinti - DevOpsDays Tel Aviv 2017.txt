Publication date: 2017-11-28
Playlist: DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2017
Description: 
	The journey of a small operations team in a fast-growing environment is always challenging. This talk describes Slackâ€™s solutions to many of our technical and cultural challenges as we scale our technical operations team around the world. We will analyze key decisions, then dig into what went well and lessons learned along the way. Attendees can expect to hear details about many issues such as handoff between timezones, partnering with software engineers for significant projects, as well as dealing with long-running incidents.

so hello everyone and welcome my name is

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,570
Vidya Quinte I work as operation

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,609
engineer for slack in Dublin

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,520
I'm originally from Italy but I'm there

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,500
since Iran 3 years I'm a member of the

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,019
storage team so I'm responsible for

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,580
everything that is that's a database

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:31,679
caching layer search and so on so that's

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,239
what we're going to talk about today so

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,620
we're gonna start talking about

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,840
scalability what it means from

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,660
engineering perspective like few

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,260
scalability pattern and that we use

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:49,260
let's say daily to solve let's say

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,890
problem we're going to go through a bit

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,430
of history about slack and also like how

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,559
we were able to scale our team and in

00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,879
the last couple of years

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,190
we're going to go through a breakout to

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,430
discovery so what went well and also

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,229
what went wrong doing that and then we

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,860
are going to jump on conclusion and if

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:13,770
we're going to have some time to QA so

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,439
let's start defining what scalability

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,189
means from an engineering perspective so

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,580
scalability again is I think everyone

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,650
here I know a bit about it it's again

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,560
the capability of a system network or

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,829
process to handle a growing amount of

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,710
work so like again this is the

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,159
definition from Wikipedia that again is

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,040
pretty like academic but let's say that

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,799
my feeling is that any scalability

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,850
problem can be kind of solved applying

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:52,770
few patterns and these are the pattern

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:55,229
that we are going to cover today so the

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,079
first one is low distribution so how you

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,750
can spread system load across multiple

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,020
process units these kind of basic one

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,229
again load balancing load sharing and

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,819
partitioning that's the kind of first

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,930
building block of scalability pattern

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:13,950
then of course you can also work on

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,470
parallelization

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,290
so work on the same task in parallel or

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,660
on multiple process units think about

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,260
MapReduce might be a good example maybe

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,620
not but yeah like this is kind of

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,470
another core pattern that allows you to

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:35,550
scale your workload and also like really

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,989
relaxing of data constraint like again

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,319
are all the kind of technique and

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:43,110
trade-off that can let you to kind of

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,900
decide well maybe this operation doesn't

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:49,800
mean to be processed immediately maybe I

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:54,709
can just a synchronously process it and

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:57,870
so on and of course also qem batching so

00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:00,900
instead of let's say hitting a lot of

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,970
overhead on a single request I can batch

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,810
multiple requests and send them in bulk

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:10,620
on system so this will allow us to kind

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:14,900
of increase or throughput and save a bit

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:19,500
of this overhead so the big question is

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,329
okay we're an engineer we work again try

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,260
to analyze things before changing them

00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:27,600
like can we like apply the same

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,970
scalability path that you apply every

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,880
day to scale system also an Operations

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,620
team

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,900
another question is let's define first

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,500
what operations team mean what's

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:46,739
operation and also like what doesn't

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:48,870
even mean like scaling a team like again

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,790
if I ask this question now I know that

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,130
like we're gonna come up with a lot of

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,290
different definition like what's a

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,560
necessary what's an operation engineer

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:02,130
what's a system engineer I think like

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:07,220
personally like my TLDR is that we all

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:11,760
design build deploy scan and maintain a

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:14,040
24/7 application that has to work again

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,959
I work for slack like it's laughs

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,459
doesn't work other people are not able

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:23,640
to have their net work done

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,740
so going back on like previous question

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,630
like does mean like skinning a team can

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,690
I just hire more people

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,900
is that true so at this point let's just

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:38,190
hire massively and hope for the best

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,790
well this doesn't work so let's start

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,940
like very simple example we are a

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,070
startup like we have an amazing idea we

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,970
have a very small team but we have time

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:54,060
to build it so again this idea came out

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,160
with let's say an MVP it's online like

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,780
people are using it so most probably

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,550
you're going to have a single operations

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,740
team this team is probably being

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,950
deployed in a single office or timezone

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,270
and also like the number of people in

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:11,670
that team is probably gonna be pretty

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:14,340
small and again like the challenge that

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,140
are starting kind of with a very small

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,000
team are like ok what happened if the

00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,490
infrastructure gets bigger than the head

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,820
of the engineers and also who's on call

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,250
like most of the time like is on call

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,860
whoever has at this stage whoever has

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,810
like SSH access to production so it can

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,740
be people from marketing as well or

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,570
things like that of course like before

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,660
we're talking about scalability pattern

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:42,150
let's now iterate on this model so your

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,690
startup is getting bigger that's great

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,580
like business seems to be going in the

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,850
right direction and you might end up

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,130
with multiple operation team so or maybe

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,890
let's call it a single operation team

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,200
that is kind of segmented to cover

00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,540
different area of expertise so you're

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,600
gonna probably are gonna end up with a

00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:06,330
partition and the responsibility again

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,160
someone might work especially on web

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,910
stock is stuck or there are gonna be

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,440
working on the network and so on this

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,420
stage most probably you're gonna still

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,560
have people deployed in a single office

00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,850
of timezone and those like number of

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,670
team member is probably gonna be less

00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:26,310
than five and those are like what are

00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:28,920
the challenges here like okay we do but

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,340
like how a big a team should be like

00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,290
what's the right size and I don't have

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,160
an answer for that like III depends on

00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:39,600
what are you doing and how do you work

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,440
another question is like okay but like

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,220
we try pulled the number of people in

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,020
ops team I'm still like 24/7 on coal

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,260
every year I don't know three weeks but

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:55,860
with less system to own most probably

00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:59,100
yes so we still didn't solve our problem

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,290
let's go now on a further iteration so

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,870
again the business is now like a company

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,750
you you are kind of established like

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,630
everything is working like you you might

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,710
have like multiple operation team

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,350
responsibilities partition by me like

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:19,090
before but you're gonna have people in

00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:21,580
multiple offices and time zone so that's

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,770
great because this might allow you to do

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,920
what we usually call follow the Sun so

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,690
you divide the 24 hour in let's say

00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,830
three or more shifts and you can say

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,300
okay

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,460
the first eight hour of the day

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,490
Melbourne is covering the on-call then

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,500
Dublin is waking up and then when let's

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,540
say Dublin goes to sleep the team in San

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,260
Francisco is gonna take over and you do

00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:48,280
that let's say every day to kind of

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:51,220
cover the world but also like this

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,880
iteration like bring new challenges like

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,590
timezone like the world is big so like

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,530
you might not have a lot of overlap

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,050
between timezone and also like how do

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,570
you manage knowledge transfer and those

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,140
like how do you like transfer like

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:11,980
company and team culture within new

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:14,470
people in the team well let's now go

00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:18,880
like step back and talking a bit about

00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:22,360
like slack and like black ops team

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,240
history against to is not gonna be kind

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,780
of a speech like sending speeches and so

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,580
on

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,700
but I think it's very important to

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:33,190
understand like the context like to

00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:36,070
understand the issue that we have

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,530
especially at the beginning so again for

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:42,010
people who might not know it slack is

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:44,620
this product allow people to let's say

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:49,420
communicate it more efficiently at work

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:51,430
and yes someone is slack in 2014

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,650
say that we are on a mission to make

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,000
your working life simpler more pleasant

00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,110
and

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,940
more productive and again like slack was

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:05,910
launched in 2014 again right now I have

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,590
office in different time zone like

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,040
business is going great we're going to

00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,380
show you in the next slide so yeah like

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,440
since the starting so I don't know how

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,900
many you aware but like slack started as

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,830
a gaming company so the game was called

00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:25,920
glitch the game didn't go that well so

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,260
they just decided okay we are using this

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,480
internal tool that we built to

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,880
communicate internally we might be able

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,080
to make a product out of it and that's

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,840
how slack started so 2013 was still like

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,390
okay let's reshape the product 2014

00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,690
public launch that was the year that we

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:50,280
had like the the highest grow despite

00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:53,760
that the line is not that high we scale

00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,220
from 0 to around a million user in a

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,250
very short amount of time and then again

00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,680
here you can see like the like the curve

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,240
that is is not bending and we have now

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,490
like more than 6 million daily active

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:10,260
user a lot of of these are connected

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,540
simultaneously with one or multiple

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:17,220
devices so that's really a challenge

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,930
like to keep with that girl again

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,610
keeping everything upper running like

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:28,160
hiring people and so on so let's analyze

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:31,860
now like how slack like I started again

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,589
2014 going back on iteration number one

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,070
that you were explaining before again

00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:40,170
that that was the public launch we had

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,070
like an ops team that was deployed in a

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:45,960
single of his time zone in San Francisco

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:48,060
and again was like the the Freestyle

00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,930
mode so everyone was doing everything

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:54,180
like the CTO was in the on-call rotation

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,900
there was a kind of catch-all core team

00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,500
dealing with any kind of issue like

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,110
network is broken

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,930
ok let's fix it search is broken ok

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,959
let's fix it customer are reporting not

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,769
able to connect in Taiwan oh let's take

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,269
a look but

00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:14,939
like there was no kind of specialization

00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:18,420
2015 business again we saw before was

00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:21,869
going well so we started hiring people

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,329
so at that point instead of being just a

00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:26,699
bunch of random people taking from CTO

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:29,699
and so on we had a kind of established

00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:33,540
team and that's when we introduced team

00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:36,899
segmentation so we broke down the ops

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,089
team in four different sub team so the

00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,730
first was a pops so dealing with any

00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:43,369
kind of DNS Network all the front-end

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,839
tier and those who the WebSocket stack

00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,939
story jobs that is the team were working

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,589
on we're responsible for database

00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:55,350
caching search queue everything that

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:57,389
let's say that is stateful visibility

00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:01,230
ops so everything related to monitoring

00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:03,660
logging matrix and data warehouse and a

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,360
four team that is building release so

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:10,759
they are responsible for all of our app

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,799
so iOS Android Mac OS Windows Mobile and

00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,720
the funny things is that okay we were

00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,379
able to break down and introduce this

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,619
segmentation so we we were able now to

00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:24,959
have people deployed on specific topic

00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:26,699
let's say we have to operate my sequel

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,980
from verse from version five six two

00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:32,610
five seven that was a task force torah

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,519
jobs the only problem is that the ankh

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,980
wall was still shared because okay we

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,170
had this kind of segmentation of team

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,649
but we didn't have enough people in each

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:46,619
team so instead of asking someone okay

00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:50,549
you are so jobs your be on call like

00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:52,850
every day like we prefer like okay you

00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:55,829
are still like in the overall ops team

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,809
you're gonna be on call once every I

00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:59,040
don't know six weeks seven weeks but

00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:02,970
they're gonna be responsible for all

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:07,169
slack so something is breaking that's

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:11,999
that's you that you have to fix it 2016

00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:14,459
and that's when I jump in so we open our

00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:17,759
W office again business was going well

00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:19,870
and still going

00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,750
unfortunately like the ops team was not

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,220
part of the initial office bootstrap so

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,410
we initially hire an engineer from

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,389
another company that unfortunately like

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,629
never proper fit with the team and

00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:34,029
that's when I joined so I joined after

00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:38,079
him and they took responsibility of

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:40,300
building our presence in Mia and we

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:44,800
learned from that experience when we set

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,079
up the Mel board team like we deploy San

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,110
Francisco operation team member there

00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:52,420
for around one year and a half he did an

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,029
awesome work again thanks Derek is not

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:59,199
here but like now we have an established

00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:02,410
presence in Melbourne thanks to him also

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,689
like 2016 talking about things that we

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,120
introduced we finally introduced the

00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:10,540
follow-the-sun encore rotation that you

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,620
were explaining before so Melbourne is

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,720
now on call or was now on call for let's

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,660
say Monday to Friday from midnight until

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,810
8:00 a.m. UTC then Dublin was kicking

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,000
off 8:00 a.m. 4:00 p.m. and then San

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:27,790
Francisco was covering the other eight

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,720
hour a day plus weekend and this is

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:34,300
because the team structure was kind of a

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,649
bit imbalance so there was a single

00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:41,589
person in Melbourne this guy Derek in

00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:44,170
Dublin was just me so I wasn't called

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,720
every day and then there was San

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,399
Francisco and that they were like 15

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,560
around 15 people so they were able to

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,769
share the Encore rotation

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:59,949
kind of in a more sustainable way so

00:14:53,769 --> 00:15:02,319
nowadays 2017 well we finally reach the

00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:06,459
point where we are now able to split the

00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:08,350
on-call so right now each team is only

00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:11,620
responsible for its own services of

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:14,050
course you are on-call more often but

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,629
the scope so the area of expertise that

00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:19,360
you need to have is way more limited so

00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:22,449
right now if we have a CDN issue I work

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,910
in a storage team I don't get paid of

00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:27,579
course if I don't know our my sister

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:31,010
clusters are down and the first person

00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:32,840
who get paid we only have a

00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,930
kind of cross team escalation like big

00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,910
red button only for global outages like

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,820
slack dot-com is down everyone is on

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:43,910
deck and again like today this team team

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,890
team structure is as you can see kind of

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,050
growing we have four people on call in

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,920
Melbourne three people on coding Dublin

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:54,560
again we are growing and we are hiding

00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,810
San Francisco we are around 20 people in

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,000
the Encore rotation so again they're

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,440
still covering weekend for us I think at

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,450
one point we're gonna have enough people

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:07,700
in Melbourne and Dublin to cover our own

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:09,460
let's say weekend so okay everything

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,140
seems fine but let's also talk about

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:15,590
let's say what went went well and what

00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:19,370
went wrong so let's start what work it

00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:22,460
well like follow the Sun rotation really

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,470
improve work-life balance like being

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,920
wake up in the middle of the night 3:00

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:30,020
a.m. man like front end is lower 10

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,820
millisecond we have an issue like you

00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,530
have to punch yourself and then open the

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,230
laptop and then try to understand what's

00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:42,080
going on that's not nice

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:44,540
and also like having the like this day

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,720
on call split across team helped a lot

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:51,320
because the small team will feel as far

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,500
far five five five farters sorry and

00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:58,220
more builders and this will also enhance

00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,710
alert ownership so if again I get page

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,270
because the front end is lower I'm in

00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,400
the data base team I'm reporting this

00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,230
issue on our pops and no one in on pops

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,300
is doing anything the day after I'm

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,860
gonna get page again if they get page

00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,780
especially in the middle of the night

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:15,980
I'm pretty sure the day after the issue

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:17,959
is going to be fixed and also like what

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,300
we found is that building team in

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,220
different offices help you as well -

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,380
well of course like avoid office

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,140
saturation but does improve diversity

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,960
and inclusion like the word is big again

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:33,440
a team that is very focus I don't know

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,700
American culture or whatever I mean

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,530
might be a bit toxic like if you kind of

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,080
bring new people in with different idea

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,960
coming from different places and so on

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,230
that's how you create a like an L theum

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,929
let's now talk about what didn't go very

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,700
well so I can tell you from my

00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:55,250
experience being the only engineer on

00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,250
coal in a region is hard especially if

00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,980
you have to cover amia again I covered

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,490
that for several months it wasn't easy

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,799
I'm happy now that we we have now a kind

00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,840
of better situation but like and also

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,360
like bootstrapping an office is really

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,720
hard and also like hiring awesome people

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,669
is even harder and always keep in mind

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,679
that scanning a team regarding what you

00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:20,870
were saying before is way more complex

00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,760
that's simply hiring people because you

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,950
need to take care about company the

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,110
department and team culture that they

00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,250
might be slightly different and also you

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,860
have to take care about knowledge

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,630
transfer so everything that is related

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,880
to onboarding everything that is related

00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,730
that how things works that's really

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:42,830
important and that's a picture of me

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:44,630
last year on December I think so

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,250
what we learned but also like what I

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:51,620
personally learn from this experience

00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:54,320
well that time zone challenge is real

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,720
like we have our offices engineering

00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,100
offices that are like spanning through

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,710
UTC - eight - UTC plus ten and just to

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,660
give you an example like it's impossible

00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:08,600
without asking someone working outside

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,940
business hour to make them a meeting all

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,059
together like you cannot see it and say

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,970
ok let's talk about how we are going to

00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:19,070
deploy this you can't like when is

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,020
midnight in one place it's gonna be

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:24,320
another time in another and like there

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,929
is no overlap so always keep this in

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,030
mind when you need to set up like

00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:31,100
engineering presence somewhere like if

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,570
you have people working the same team in

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,710
three different time zone they might end

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:38,780
up doing let's say weekly meeting for

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,910
example one week San Francisco EE and

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:45,830
the second week San Francisco Melbourne

00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:47,510
and that's important also what I

00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,730
personally found that documentation is

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:52,040
essential like especially when you are

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,900
alone something is breaking like you

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,260
don't know what's happening like having

00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,770
a clear document we we use this today on

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,050
call it's a

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,180
simple markdown documents that everyone

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,670
who's on call should update it with

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,010
what's outstanding and also like

00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:11,210
incident hand off like usually when

00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:13,980
there is a like an ongoing the incident

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,710
we try to hand it off to another region

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,710
instead of working overtime and also

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:22,080
like having nice ram books so for our

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,450
box movie we mean like documentation

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,930
that can help people they don't know

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:31,080
about a service or are specific colors

00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:33,630
what is going on so like you get page I

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,270
don't know for my sequel being slow or a

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,700
specific I don't know sub process that

00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,590
person might not have all the data like

00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,680
again think about we're growing that

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,420
fast no like no one can have the

00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,820
overview of everything that is going on

00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,100
and again regarding this there is my

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,410
coworker Joe that tomorrow is gonna do a

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,070
talk about automation and ROM book I

00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:59,190
suggest before and also keep in mind

00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:02,300
that again you are not alone like I

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:04,950
think a fair a bit at this last year

00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:07,080
like we have this role about being

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,770
incident commander so that's the person

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,690
who usually take care of kind of

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:17,490
organizing the effort to mitigate an

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:20,610
issue and from time to time like I kind

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,080
of like thought okay I can do I can do

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,780
everything by myself like you can do

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,780
with this issue like that's something

00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,700
that cannot scale and also like having

00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,440
data and clear procedure to escalate

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,860
incidents especially when you are alone

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,690
you can say like okay I'm hitting

00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,230
something in my sequel I don't know I

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,440
trouble shoot 20 minutes like I don't

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:45,180
know I need to have the possibility to

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,540
escalate the incident with a person of

00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:51,300
my team or if for example a store UPS

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:54,720
issue is triggered by an octave up pops

00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:57,090
issue I should be able also to escalate

00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,420
across team but also across engineering

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:02,790
team or also across departments so if

00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,220
slack is down or slack is low or a

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:08,370
feature is not working like our customer

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:11,100
experience team has to update statuses

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,540
lack comm and things like that and the

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,370
same for provider

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,880
like again we know run our own data

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:20,700
center the problem is that if Amazon is

00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,820
down like we are down or like our

00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,560
performance performance might be

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:28,080
degraded so it's very important to have

00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:32,700
detailed and clear procedure also to

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:35,280
escalate incident across provider what

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,220
we found also was not that difficult but

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,710
like Laki is an awesome tool light to

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,350
kind of solve a few of these issue like

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,840
slack really uses lack to improve your

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:49,020
distributed work and how we do that well

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:53,100
we have different channels like that are

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,900
dedicated to specific alerts everything

00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,850
that is a kind of production impacting

00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:00,480
or there is something going on we

00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,860
discuss it in ops and also like the the

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,880
best feature in my opinion is that

00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,380
everything is documented by design so if

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,600
you wake up in Dublin I don't know you

00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,310
get page or whatever or you just want to

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,430
investigate what happened yesterday

00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:16,350
night to a cluster well you have that

00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,840
information is like you have bought

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:21,900
reporting that an operation is going on

00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,400
or here we have Patrick my teammates

00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,490
again saying like I'm doing this

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,430
operation or Jenkins say oh we just

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:32,760
promotes a bill to death or Aaron Paul

00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:35,280
saying like we deploy a Singapore we put

00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,740
it live again it's also very important

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,340
like to keep people in the loop and for

00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:44,250
the loop I mean like kind of get them

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:47,400
like feeling like they are part of a

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:50,190
group and like it's difficult in remote

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,990
steam and I suggest like especially like

00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,990
partnering with soft an engineer for

00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:57,960
project and architecture review like in

00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:00,630
February I started this huge project

00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,870
about redesigning all the database

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:05,940
system at slack so that project was

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,460
something that we kick I kick it off in

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:12,030
Dublin with another guy from San

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,070
Francisco and I mean I'm pretty happy to

00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,290
say like it's serving like a slight

00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,240
amount of production traffic but that's

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,480
something that really helped me to keep

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,920
in loop with people in San Francisco

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,360
also like having B annual and peer

00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,900
feedback and performance review is

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,930
pretty important

00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:33,190
and having like the possibility to visit

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:35,140
your HQ more than once a year I found

00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:38,230
also very important like if you have a

00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:42,130
remote manager like I do like visited

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:45,430
like having weekly one-on-one we also

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:47,530
have like other like program like cross

00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,780
team one one we call it ops Donuts and

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,070
global recognition like winner of the

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,100
week and kudos

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:57,040
so ops Donuts is a simple bots that help

00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:00,700
you to know better your team mates by

00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:04,000
pairing everyone every two four weeks

00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,710
and that's just like having five minutes

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,180
to talk about things like try to

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:11,320
understand what the other person is

00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:13,390
doing and so on also like having global

00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,880
recognition like with program like kudos

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,830
again in this case like my manager

00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,420
kudos me in front of the company say

00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,310
holy widow you did it very well

00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,290
yesterday because you deal with this

00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:29,280
incident in a nice way we also have this

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:31,600
win of the week so that's a program that

00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,320
kind of recognized the effort that

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,830
someone did during the week - I don't

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:42,130
know fix an ST bug or address and

00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:45,490
internal or customer needs and again in

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:48,490
this case for example mode like she

00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:53,980
create an automatic report tool to get

00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:56,890
our API endpoint usage and again that's

00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,900
that that might be something like simple

00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,940
but it's really cool to have like

00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,790
recognize in front of the company the

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:06,160
work that you did and the trophy is

00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:08,440
called Callie we have another picture

00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,900
here we have a more detailed picture

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:16,480
here and I don't know if you know my CTO

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:20,290
but yeah so let's jump now to the

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,720
conclusion so bootstrapping a team is

00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,520
art we say it before especially if in

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,010
the meantime we have to keep slack up

00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:30,070
and running work on project a temp

00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:33,670
repair meeting and also like participate

00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:35,320
in like mentoring and onboarding always

00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,480
keep in mind that no one is Superman

00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,220
like you can be smart you can be oh yeah

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,830
I can do this I can do that no

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,470
you can't and also like that there is no

00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:49,210
emergency that you can handle and other

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:52,270
people can also like on cold burnout is

00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:54,190
real like you don't feel it it just

00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:57,610
arrived at one point like you're just

00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:00,760
dead to work and when it happened like

00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:03,299
try to increase like a wall nests in HQ

00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:06,490
before a problem became an emergency

00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:08,770
also like our motto is like work hard to

00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:11,799
go home like disable notification

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:15,669
outside business hour don't reply to DMS

00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:19,000
outside your business hour and also like

00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:20,830
if you're working in HQ and try always

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,260
to do an extra mile for your teammates

00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:25,990
so always ask yourself before pushing a

00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:28,900
change how this change affect employees

00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:31,600
in other time zone and also like give

00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:33,940
their peers the highest priority so code

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,070
review is important like I would love to

00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,309
come back to work in the morning and say

00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:42,250
oh Joe just review all of my PR I can

00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:44,919
merge or I can fix all the issue like

00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:47,620
I'm not block from someone else that has

00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,570
review my code also try to not schedule

00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,610
meetings too late in their day we saw it

00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:53,409
before like the overlap between time

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,380
zone is really thin like you might have

00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:58,360
like one hour one hour and a half of

00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:02,740
overlap without asking someone to work

00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:05,409
overtime and also like push people like

00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,940
to give you important work if it's

00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:08,980
already too late in their day

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,110
they're my shy people that they don't

00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,539
say you like oh look I already work at

00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:16,150
8:00 hour today can you deal with this

00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:18,520
issue like try to push them and say hey

00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,080
if you want I can take care of that and

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,120
also like make sure that your code is

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,880
documented and easy to understand like

00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,309
what is easy for you and like oh that's

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,470
clear like yeah that's that's really

00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:31,299
easy like might not be the same for

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:33,309
people who work in another time zone

00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:35,740
they don't have the context that you

00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:38,230
have about that change and of course

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,330
like make sure that any infrastructure

00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:44,080
change ongoing maintenance and so on is

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:46,570
documented what I also learn that again

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,190
when you are in HQ try to spend more

00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,289
time talking with people than writing

00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,909
codes because you can always write code

00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:52,870
you are on the plane your board you

00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:55,090
write code

00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,860
you cannot do the same when you talk

00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,779
with people and again try to focus on

00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:03,309
meeting and project planning and have

00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:05,770
fun again when people are coming to for

00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:07,570
example from Dublin to Dublin from SF

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:09,610
try to increase awareness of the

00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,529
challenge of working remotely and also

00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,750
like share your experience and of course

00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:18,070
have fun with colleague like I did in

00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:22,960
these few slides so I don't know if you

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:24,340
have time for Q&A so I work in basically

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,760
essentially the operations team that

00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:29,260
Facebook and one thing is we don't use

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,390
Facebook to coordinator Facebook

00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:35,049
incidents because Facebook could be down

00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:37,240
so they can't use paper yeah we have our

00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:40,059
B plan so I'm curious

00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,159
oh so you have IRC for backup we have a

00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:45,370
B plan I cannot tell you which one but

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:48,370
like of course when an unknown tip shots

00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:53,370
but like where's lucky is down of course

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:53,370
we cannot coordinate incident in yeah

00:29:54,149 --> 00:30:01,779
overall I think 800 now yeah I think

00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:03,940
last last official number 800 but yeah

00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:06,070
the operations team again it's still

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,130
pretty small so if you want challenged

00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:11,440
and like running an f1 car and someone

00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:13,630
asks you to change the tyre without

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,620
stopping the car well like calm slash

00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,690
jobs in Israel know we might allow

00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:22,779
people to work remotely and I don't know

00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,790
try then we can talk about it thank you

00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:28,460
very much

00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:28,460
