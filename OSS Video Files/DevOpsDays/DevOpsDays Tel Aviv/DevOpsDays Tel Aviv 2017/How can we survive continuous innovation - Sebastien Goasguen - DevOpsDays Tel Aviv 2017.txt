Description: 
	How can we survive continuous innovation?

Cloud, containers, serverless sprinkled with microservices. The IT industry has been taken by a storm of new technologies boosted by open source. But how on earth can we follow these changes, how can we make decisions and keep it up wave after wave. Maybe this is the essence of DevOps: Evolution

so thank you thank you everyone for

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,710
coming it is great to be in tel-aviv and

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,570
I'm going to try to do like a really

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,770
good job to talk about how to survive

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,630
continuous innovation so new term maybe

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,269
other people have I've mentioned it

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,769
before but I was talking with Sharon and

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,560
she was like hey why don't you submit a

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,599
talk for dev update status and I was at

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,369
DevOps today's room and then I will also

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,200
go to DevOps days I'm sure that I'm

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,420
quite quite a bit it's like yeah sure

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,360
let's go to Tel Aviv let's let's submit

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,399
a talk so I went a little bit outside my

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,590
comfort zone I'm not going to talk about

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,550
Cuban ETS or containers I'm going to

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,489
talk about continuous innovation okay

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:52,590
and click yes and of course it's a

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,379
little bit strange for me I think a lot

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,660
of us suffer from impostor syndrome and

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,940
you'll look really really smart looks

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,859
like you all know what you're doing and

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,260
I always feel like I'm like you know I'm

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,560
not sure I know what I'm doing I'm not a

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,930
dev I'm actually you know the knobs

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,659
either I'm more of a tester product

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,420
manager slash marketing slash evangelist

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,790
so it's a big bundle of things that you

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,610
know hopefully makes make sense

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,210
but you know when when I decided to

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,650
write the talk I I thought you know it

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,210
doesn't matter what you need to do is

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,939
share your perspective share you know

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,920
your experience in ite your experience

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,020
with software and then share that with

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,430
people and hopefully you know they're

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,810
going to learn something good and then

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,920
come out of the keynote saying hey you

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,570
know that's interesting I should

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,790
actually think about this a little bit

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,590
more I go to a lot of conferences and

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,649
when I go to a conference I always try

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,869
to do two things I try to you know

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,369
attend a good talk you know and you

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,130
don't have to attend 20 but I attend a

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,930
good talk get some good swag and then

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,119
learn something very interesting from

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,890
from someone so you know that's that's

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,170
what I'm going to try to do here share

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,600
my perspective and hopefully again I

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,430
learned something interesting very

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,140
excited to come to Israel because I came

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,300
here with my kids wife like three years

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,099
ago we had a beautiful trip throughout

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,850
entire Israel we went to the Dead Sea we

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,980
went to LA

00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,950
came back up and it was really beautiful

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,260
trip so tomorrow I'm going to sneak out

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,540
I'm gonna go back to Jerusalem and then

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,030
walk around and really you have you have

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,770
a beautiful country and you know really

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,390
really liked it so really happy to be

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:32,490
here people you know there's an issue

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,870
when you know I'm sitting here standing

00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,220
here in front of you and you're like who

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,930
is this guy you know it looks like he's

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,730
French he has a bit of an accent but you

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,500
know what is what's his background we

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,570
don't we don't really know him so you

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,920
can look me up of course on LinkedIn and

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,890
Twitter but I thought you know a couple

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,480
pictures to give you my bio so I'm not a

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,120
developer I'm actually an electrical

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,400
engineer I started by designing radios

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,830
and then working on the electromagnetics

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,050
and radars for the army and building

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,110
things like this like amplifiers and

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,910
then you know basically microwave

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,920
monolithic circuits and I got totally

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,140
sidetracked doing this I started doing

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,600
simulation of those and when you do

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,050
simulations you need to write code and

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,510
then run that on big clusters so now was

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,370
right I was using big clusters and I got

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,050
totally sidetracked again I keep being

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,480
sidetracked that's the story of my life

00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,760
and I got sidetracked and I started

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,200
working on clouds and before they were

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,810
called clouds they were called grids

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,730
except that one day we sprinkled virtual

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,620
machines on top of those grids and they

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,140
became clouds so I did a lot of work on

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,030
clouds and now you know I write books

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,650
and I wrote the communities cookbook

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,820
because of course you know a virtual

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:47,550
machines you know or so like 1995 no

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:49,220
okay well 2009 10:15 but you know of

00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,500
course I started doing containers and

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:57,480
this book is coming up soon $49.99 on

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,340
O'Reilly you can all go buy it and now I

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,810
work at bitna be a senior director of

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,020
cloud technologies I actually had a

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,090
startup in Switzerland and bitNami Boris

00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,310
for all the the community's work we we

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,290
were doing so that spares you like a

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,090
tour to LinkedIn and you get you know

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,090
the very quick idea of Who I am

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,109
so now a little personal story because I

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,060
think that's that's the idea of sharing

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:23,400
your perspective and then hopefully you

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,590
can you can get you know something you

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,270
know something from it that my person

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,240
stories that I spent a lot of time in

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,870
academia doing research so I was writing

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,540
a bunch of scientific papers studying

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,850
clouds studying virtualization so that's

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,550
just like some snapshots from from

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,919
Google Scholar so I wrote like you know

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,620
an evaluation of kvam for using cloud

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,930
computing dynamic provisioning of

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,669
virtual organization clusters that

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,590
sounds like a mouthful but what does

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,389
that means your videos virtual

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,850
organization they were the big thing in

00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:59,070
grid computing and basically they are

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,870
you know virtual clusters and then

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,490
dynamic provisioning well you know

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,380
that's basically a cloud you have an API

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,150
and then you call that API and say hey

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,850
give me a virtual cluster give me you

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,160
know give me some VMs so before you had

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,810
ec2 you know we're talking about things

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,120
like this like virtual organization

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,250
clusters that you provision thanks to

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,889
virtual machines so I was doing all of

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,180
this you know that was published in 2009

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,880
that means that the work actually

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,090
started maybe in 2006 because academia

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,669
takes a long time to get papers out and

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,139
you know everything was going well but

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:32,490
of course there are other people in

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,460
academia that we're doing similar things

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,150
like which Wolski at University of Santa

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,070
Barbara

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,760
you know guys you know rich Wolski

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:43,260
you've heard of him UCSB and then you

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,880
know one day I was sitting there and

00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,520
then BOOM this came out on the news

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,190
eucalyptus system raises 5.5 million

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,410
dollar for hybrid approach to cloud

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,050
computing so rich Wolski who was doing

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,880
very similar research to to mine and you

00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,130
know granted much smarter you know

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,620
person than me is older and he was doing

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,570
you know much better work suddenly is

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,370
doing the same thing and it just raised

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,590
5.5 million dollars and he has a

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,570
start-up and it's eucalyptus and from

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,960
there you know the world goes crazy with

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:15,060
eucalyptus it's a clone of of AWS a

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,430
little bit later couple years later they

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,820
raised 30 million round see and it says

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,380
to take on VMware okay which I think was

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,030
kind of interesting because these days

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,039
you actually see exactly the same way I

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,039
look for it I look for exactly the same

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:32,190
headline about docker like docker raises

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,770
60 million to take on VMware but I

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,080
didn't find the exact same headline okay

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,360
but the bottom line is that I was doing

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,280
this research

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,469
we were writing software with my my

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,150
research group the guys were good you

00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,189
know we were writing good software we

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,810
were testing it we were deploying it we

00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:50,509
were testing measuring performance at

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,460
scale this was good stuff and then at

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:56,120
the same time you know there's somebody

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,979
else in at UCSB his software just you

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,159
know hits the jackpot and suddenly it

00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:04,009
becomes you know used at least maybe not

00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:05,599
used but known heavily and people start

00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:08,990
looking at it and saying hey I want to

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,729
use you characters okay so it really

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,949
triggered me so I was in academia I was

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:15,169
like why this software why this software

00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,449
and not another one how do we find

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,610
software you know how you guys have

00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,169
problems in your in your enterprise you

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,900
know you're dealing with you know issues

00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:26,210
like monitoring or you know provisioning

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,370
configuration how do you find the

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,639
software that can you know help you and

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,949
and bring a solution how do you choose

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,139
how do you choose one software versus

00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,849
another because you know hopefully it's

00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:39,259
a rational choice you've been doing some

00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:41,060
testing you've been doing some studies

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:43,310
but more often than not I think that

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:47,120
people actually choose software you know

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:49,310
almost like on gut okay and then why do

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,289
we had the adopt software why why would

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,509
do we add up this one versus another one

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,400
so those were you know kind of the the

00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,979
questions that I was you know asking

00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,680
myself at that time and I decided to you

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:02,900
know get on an adventure and try to

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,360
figure this out so I actually left

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,849
academia I went to corporate corporate

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,339
site I went to the dark side

00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:12,789
I went really dark I went took a job at

00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,789
Citrix

00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,200
but you know what's good pay it was a

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,120
good fun that was good

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,130
so of course you know when we talk about

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,990
why this software and not another one

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,640
and why do we adopt this definitely

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,680
there are trends in the industry we know

00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,050
that we have trans okay and that's you

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,910
know of course the Google trend it's not

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,160
perfect but it's difficult to find data

00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,169
for this okay it's not perfect but you

00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,630
you you get it so what do you see 2008

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,540
time like too far from here

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:45,030
but you see 2008 the the Green Line

00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,650
picks up that eucalyptus a little bit

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,920
later the blue line that goes really

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,850
high

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,590
that's OpenStack the purple line that's

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,700
cloud stack I worked on cloud stack for

00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,860
for Citrix

00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,480
you see that it doesn't go up too much

00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:03,240
falls down and then the red line that's

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,430
Cuban it is it's just skyrocketing okay

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,740
that's the really in thing and then I

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,660
plotted the the yellow line also that if

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,810
you see the little line it's a WS lambda

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,480
so AWS lambda is also picking up a lot

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,890
so we know that they are trends and the

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,650
problem with transit that they also

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,840
represent fashion and should we use

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,990
fashion should we should we you know

00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,990
better solutions better our systems on

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,910
fashion and you know of course you can

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,790
say no oh we shouldn't bet on fashion

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,370
but yeah I'm sure a lot of us bet on

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,410
fashion the problem with fashion is that

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,900
you see things like this like you know

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,760
and that was that was last year oh my

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,240
god lambda is killing it that was just

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,800
after AWS we invent oh my god lambda is

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,420
killing it people are going to skip

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,100
container orchestrators you know

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,410
straight they're gonna go straight to

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,910
server less and you know just stop your

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,830
cloud effort you know ditch your

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,630
OpenStack or your cloud stack effort

00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,300
forget about containers we go server

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,430
less on bare metal okay that was that

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,430
was the fashion that was you know it's

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,400
still happening who is doing this

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:11,670
there you go straight to bare metal and

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:13,410
and and lambdas right so I mean I'm not

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,510
gonna talk about it technically but you

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,070
know that's that's the kind of things

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,800
that that you made that you mean here

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,450
and then there was another thing that

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,850
that troubled me you know during all

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,169
that time and and

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,350
you know when I was looking at the

00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:29,269
software that if you look at rnd R&D

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,249
budget money that's being put in R&D

00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:34,729
that creates innovation creates software

00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:39,979
more and more it's dominated by Google

00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:43,669
Apple Facebook Amazon Gotha right so

00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:47,389
Gaffa here that's that's from 2015 I

00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:50,809
think yeah yeah that's 2015 data so you

00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:52,939
see that 2015 data the Gaffa was 36

00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:55,100
billion dollars a year and right now I

00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:56,779
couldn't find the exact data but you

00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,839
know it's it's it should roughly be

00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:01,699
hundred billion dollar and you need to

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,249
put this in comparison that the R&D

00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:06,999
budget of Israel from Wikipedia okay I

00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:10,729
mean you guys will correct me okay but

00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:14,389
it should be 15 billion dollars okay so

00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:16,220
Amazon spends more on R&D or twice as

00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:21,499
much on air or three times as much on

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,629
R&D as Israel and they spend probably as

00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:25,609
much as France

00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:28,069
okay so I think you know we're seeing

00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:30,889
this this you know this trend that now

00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:32,629
all the innovation and consequently a

00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:34,699
lot of software that we're gonna see are

00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:38,569
actually driven by companies rather than

00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:41,839
you know more I would say you know

00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:44,749
research unaffiliated let's call it like

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,309
that unaffiliated research okay so

00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:48,169
that's that's you know that's that's

00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:50,720
something that's interesting to me and

00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:52,459
and it it's making me wonder a little

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,409
bit and maybe that's the subject for our

00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:56,059
open space so a couple observation I

00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:58,220
think that there is a perceived

00:11:56,059 --> 00:12:00,439
increased pace of software innovation

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,879
you guys feel that - do you guys feel

00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:03,499
that you know there's more and more

00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:10,279
software coming at you more and more

00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:12,859
tools coming at you yes no my keynote is

00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:14,209
saved because that's what I feel I feel

00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:17,720
like there's more and more you know

00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:19,850
software coming in and then budgets

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,829
you know R&D budget is more and more

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,929
dominated by companies so when we see

00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:26,569
you know what is what we is available to

00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:28,850
us is actually really driven by by

00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:30,439
vendors it's not you know it's not I'm

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,119
not saying it's it's really bad but you

00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:34,339
know that's definitely a tendency and

00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:35,809
what we're saying from from you know

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,430
more of an academic standpoint is that

00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:39,610
instead

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:41,320
having a brain drain like 20 years 25

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,970
years ago in France we were very worried

00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,370
because all the brains we're going to

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,649
the US we call that brain drain and now

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,050
it's not you know brain drain to another

00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:53,050
state is brain drain to a corporation so

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,890
all the French brains are going to you

00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:58,870
know Google or Amazon or you know summer

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,839
so it's not a problem you know we'll

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,790
we'll see and then there is this

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,490
expectation that you know us like

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,020
workforce IT professionals you know we

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,000
should be trained on all those new

00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,680
technologies but how can you keep up

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,930
with all of this when every month every

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,470
six months there is something new you

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:19,270
know it's super super difficult I would

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,610
say that I'm in a privileged situation

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,709
because that's kind of my job to do tech

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,660
watch to monitor all those technologies

00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:27,910
and then you know find the time to test

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,430
them and even now you know I struggle to

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,910
have the time to test all those tacks so

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:36,490
if you actually are writing software and

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,050
operating it in production I bet that

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,260
you have very little time to study

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:44,200
everything that's coming at you

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:46,150
so to illustrate this you know let's

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,500
look at the landscapes that we're seeing

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,330
these days okay

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,880
the landscapes and then we are asking

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,830
everybody to be a full-stack engineer

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,680
because that's you know the new thing

00:13:53,830 --> 00:14:02,020
right well here you go here's your full

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:05,350
stack okay good luck docker docker

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,839
ecosystem I'll let you look at all the

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,300
logos and when I was putting the slides

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,130
together I looked up on Google and there

00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,480
are tons more landscapes okay it's

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,390
actually kind of funny too

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,550
to look at all of them you know of

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,459
course like here you see that console is

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,260
under orchestration why is console under

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:25,029
orchestration this was before Cuban it

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,700
is so there is no community so of course

00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:29,459
those landscapes are changing a lot and

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,350
then you have other landscapes

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:34,300
automation you know and of course to do

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,899
release management the one that I find

00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:40,970
funny is Excel you know so release

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:43,950
management with Excel

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,320
it's actually you know I find it funny

00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,180
but it's not it's not that entirely

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,730
funny because when I studied CloudStack

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,620
I mean start working on cloud stack I

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,600
met one of the one of the guys and we

00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,820
had a cloud stack had a totally

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,430
unsecured port we called it the

00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,530
management API that of course you should

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,660
turn off okay but there wasn't

00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:07,350
management API and you could you could

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:09,300
talk straight HTTP no no SSL at all to

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,580
it and you could do configuration so the

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,150
guy to do the configuration of the cloud

00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:18,120
had written an Excel spreadsheet with

00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,740
HTTP URLs and it would click on his

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,620
spreadsheet you know to do the

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,550
configuration of the cloud and I looked

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:29,880
at it I was like wow yeah that's Wow

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:32,460
super secure and we are DevOps so here

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,690
is your your landscape here is you know

00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,720
everything that you need to learn

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,880
because you're doing DevOps you're

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,560
DevOps engineer right everybody is a

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,120
DevOps engineer here so here is your

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,900
stack I mean it's it's totally

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,640
unmanageable I mean that's that's crazy

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,260
I don't blame I don't blame the vendors

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,840
okay they are trying to say hey here is

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,430
the state of you know the solutions that

00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:58,200
are out there here is the state of

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:59,760
software but as a user as an engineer if

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,970
you look at something like this you know

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:06,240
there is no way you can do and if you do

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:10,190
big data good luck okay if you do big

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,380
data good luck because I don't know

00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:15,360
impossible and and you think this is the

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,700
end you think that this is just like

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,830
potentially vendors you know trying to

00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,800
say hey look my software is part of the

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,960
landscape but this is the newly formed

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,320
cloud native computing foundation that's

00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,990
the CNC f landscape this is brand new CN

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,420
CF that's where communities is Kuban it

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:37,050
is has been donated as the seed project

00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,730
to this foundation and the landscape and

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,250
they're putting this this landscape

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,470
together it started with just Cuba

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,630
lettuce and then they added the software

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,690
that are part of the foundation and now

00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:51,180
they have this and I know them very well

00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:54,680
they're all friends but this is getting

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:57,020
a little bit insane as well you know

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,800
I hear that they're working on a 3d

00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,660
version because the 2d because the 2d

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,760
version you know that you cannot figure

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:09,020
out anything so they're working on a 3d

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,449
version you probably can see it but like

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,339
next to the barcode it says hey here's

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:14,959
the cloud native landscape so if you're

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,309
doing cloud native and we don't really

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,170
know what that means okay

00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:20,120
it's you're you're running an

00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,059
application with containers in the cloud

00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,380
something like that

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:26,270
they still haven't defined it but if

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,189
you're doing cloud native they say here

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,500
are all the solutions that you can use

00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:32,450
and of course some of these are part of

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,610
the DevOps landscape and blah blah

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,700
landscape and the other landscape but

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:40,600
they're saying the the path most

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,700
traveled is the path with the blue boxes

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,470
so they are giving you the idea that by

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,030
the way you know that's the total

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,950
landscape but you should really pay

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:52,010
attention to the software that are part

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:55,640
of the CN CF so communities primitives

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:58,190
for monitoring you know notary and tough

00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,500
are now part of that rocket container

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,360
deep so you know they're giving you a

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:07,730
hint of a you should you should use this

00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:10,370
and who is using envoi here right if you

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:13,400
go to the Silicon Valley ok and you're

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,740
not using envoi I mean you're you're

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,750
totally out of it ok your stuffs not

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:22,580
gonna work it's gonna break tomorrow

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:24,200
you're not using envoi oh my god ok but

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:28,100
they make you they make you think that

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,929
it's the future ok and I and I know it's

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,520
new future I'm part of this you know a

00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:33,590
little bit I'm part of this movement I I

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,309
kind of help that you know those those

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:39,260
ideas okay but you know we have to fight

00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:41,000
all of this as a as a community it's the

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:44,630
future and you know this blog from

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,940
circle see I have you read this ok so

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,710
you should definitely read this blog ok

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:53,630
Google Circles yeah it's the future it's

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,750
hilarious dialogue between a guy that

00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:00,320
says somebody that says hey I have this

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:02,929
application it's a it's a web app I want

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,360
to deploy it you know what do I do and

00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:07,640
then there's somebody else answering is

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,890
like oh dude you need to go container

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,170
and then you need a fleet of sirs and

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,360
and then you have 12 microservices and

00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,970
then you know you have HDD orchestrating

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,100
and it's hilarious you have to read it

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:22,640
because that type of conversation you

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,620
know happens a lot and you go from hey

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,780
I'm trying to put this little tiny app

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,380
in production with you know it's just a

00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:32,030
web app to you know deploying a

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,740
brand-new infrastructure with

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:38,210
cutting-edge software that just got

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:40,940
released so we have to fight this the

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,700
problem is that you know as an industry

00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,470
I think we are we are starting to build

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,220
this which is the fear of missing out

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,230
FOMO

00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,910
you know oh my god if you're not using

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,980
anvil you're missing out you don't have

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,500
encryption between all your server less

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,080
functions in your data center dude

00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,150
you're going to be get attacked okay

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,760
you're missing out you need to use envoi

00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,770
well okay try to use Android check out

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,700
the documentation I mean that's not

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:09,740
ready okay you need to use distributed

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,020
tracing you need to use open tracing the

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,820
spec is great comes from you uber

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,720
it's called yogurt racing it's great

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:20,420
well check the documentation is you know

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,700
yeah exactly and then there is a problem

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,260
of you know being cool versus not being

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,390
cool and of course everybody would like

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,510
to be cool okay we all want to be cool

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:32,060
but you know what's happening we have a

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,980
lot of social pressure yeah that's true

00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,080
even in IT you know we have social

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,440
pressure to be cool and to use the

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,480
latest thing we have to fight this

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,900
somehow because it leads to things like

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,520
this

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,220
and I stole that term from Chris

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,640
buttered up so Chris is one of the

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,550
instigators of DevOps you know it does a

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,410
lot of the the DevOps talks out of out

00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,820
of Belgium I mean he goes to I'm sure he

00:20:54,410 --> 00:21:00,020
came here right yeah

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,550
as you come here so he recently coined

00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,260
that term and maybe somebody else going

00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,030
that term which is zero-days software

00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,680
instead of you know zero devil never

00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,070
eight eight zero this software so you

00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:14,030
know console two three four just came

00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:15,470
out we go production right you know no

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:18,110
testing we go production zero dead

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,730
software you know put in production this

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:25,190
is just insane

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:27,559
the gif doesn't work do I need to yeah

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,690
exactly PDF no gif you're right it

00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:35,840
worked in keynote oh my god I use

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:37,279
proprietary software so you know I think

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,950
that's what's happening does that does

00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:46,159
that resonate yeah kind of yeah so why

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:48,710
this explosion of why this explosion of

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,340
software and why this kind of you know

00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:56,190
feeling this pressure let's go back to

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,250
that trend and what happened in 2008

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:03,440
[Music]

00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:07,490
stock market get up get up was created

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,980
in 2008 okay so it's not not long ago

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:12,820
how are we sharing software before 2008

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:17,059
I have no clue I don't remember

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:22,100
SourceForge oh my god SVN oh my god mm

00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:26,210
CVS no security oh my god how oh my god

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:29,389
we were emailing patches oh my god so

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:34,010
2008 get up and look that's exactly when

00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:38,590
you started and you know I love AWS you

00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:42,830
think that EWS ts3 started in in 2005

00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:44,419
2005 s3 and ec2 2006 okay that was

00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,250
before github get up started to that

00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:49,210
night and then look at the growth of

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:53,179
github so at the bottom you have 2008

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:56,269
38,000 repos thousand repos are you

00:22:53,179 --> 00:23:02,120
kidding I have 20,000 containers in

00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:05,120
production so 38 repository 8000 report

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:10,010
in 2008 41,000 users that's nothing look

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:14,059
at the growth 2012 4 million 2.7 million

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:16,750
users and from Wikipedia like the source

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:20,000
of truth for the world

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,100
57 million repos right now 20 million

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,600
users

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,429
ok that's huge so I don't know if it's

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,269
exponential but you know definitely a

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:30,710
huge you know power power boost there 20

00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:32,570
million users is a very interesting

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,530
number to me because I've been trying to

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,800
figure out how many

00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:38,570
IT professionals they are in the world

00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,790
so define IT professionals it's it's

00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,380
really not easy okay to to actually find

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,620
a finer number because if you look at

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:49,180
Microsoft related data they said that

00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:54,500
they have 30 million Microsoft you know

00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:57,140
people so you know it's probably

00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,680
something like 15 million you know I

00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,570
would say like you know so we're getting

00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,710
close to everybody who is touching

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:08,120
software or using apps is on github it's

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,890
pretty it's pretty close I mean some

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,810
some people say you know it's 20 million

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:16,460
idea take and why why does this matter

00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,550
because software is eating the world

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,260
that's understand Horvitz in 2011 that

00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,090
said this all the companies all the new

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,440
businesses are based on on software

00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,320
innovation software is eating the world

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,240
open source is eating software that's

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:35,660
the red fish eating the blue fish and

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:38,090
then the blue fish is Amazon so the

00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,960
light blue it's supposed to be cloud

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:46,400
okay but since the cloud is you know 70%

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,960
AWS so you know open source is now

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,030
eating software everything we do

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,450
software is open source so everything we

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:57,890
do you know in software is on github

00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:59,930
okay and an OSS because of get up this

00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,940
is social collaboration so there's a

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,920
link to Twitter it's very social you

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,870
know the way we share software and and

00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,090
so on so every vendor is now doing open

00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,310
source software every almost every

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,750
solution these days is open source if a

00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,310
vendor is not doing open source they're

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,710
being asked why isn't this open source

00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:19,070
we are starting to expect everything for

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:22,820
free right except maybe support mmm free

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:24,590
support that would be nice a lot of open

00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,080
source conferences are very very very

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,700
vendor driven except devops days and

00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:34,520
fuss them and thank you to all the

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:36,440
sponsors now I mean it's a I'm you know

00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,270
I'm not I'm not banging on the sponsors

00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,680
and I work for a company and I'm here

00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,780
because you know somebody is paying of

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,180
course but there are lots of there are

00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,310
lots of conferences that are heavily you

00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,210
know driven by vendors and it's all

00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,400
about in

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:51,560
making sure that people use your

00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,900
solution of course there is an explosion

00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,750
of tools so we've seen we've seen that

00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,030
and software go viral thanks to social

00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:01,400
media so thanks to Twitter saying thanks

00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:03,320
to github software going viral so we

00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,150
have this tendency of saying oh my god

00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,340
this is going viral I need to you put

00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,620
Android in production or now you know

00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:13,490
everybody's starring and boy I need to

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:17,300
put it in production so it has you know

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:20,870
additional additional issues but let's

00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,520
remember DevOps okay and it's kind of

00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,680
funny for me to say this because you

00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,700
know I don't think I'm a DevOps guy but

00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:31,700
let's remember DevOps okay and the first

00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,250
time I went to Amsterdam and DevOps days

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,530
Amsterdam I was there and John Willis

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:39,440
was was talking so John is also one of

00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:41,450
the instigator the creator of of the

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,180
DevOps movement with Patrick Dubois and

00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:46,540
so on and John is John is a great guy

00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,220
you should follow him on Twitter or

00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,260
follow his presentation and and he

00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,450
started talking about culture and I was

00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,190
like oh my god are you kidding I came to

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,990
a tech conference I want to hear about

00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,400
tech I want to see software I want to

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,680
see code I want to know how you're

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,000
managing this stuff in production that's

00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,270
what I want to learn I don't want to

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,610
learn about culture okay that was me

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,470
that was me thinking that and now as I'm

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,240
looking at this and seeing this

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:14,270
explosion of software I'm like okay it's

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,130
all about culture guys so we need to

00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,530
have the right culture in our companies

00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:23,360
to be able to face you know this this

00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:25,460
evolution the you know one of the big

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,230
thing about DevOps definitely if you

00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,000
haven't read it you should read the dev

00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,520
the Finnick the DevOps project the

00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,830
Phoenix project who has read the Phoenix

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,140
project okay that's not enough people

00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:39,920
you need to everybody needs to read the

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:42,230
Phoenix project it's written big you can

00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,330
read it in one weekend you know it's a

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,670
it's a and it's not a tech book it's

00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,440
actually a novel and it's a novel about

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,780
IT professionals and how they are

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,090
struggling with putting software in

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,280
production managing it and and meeting

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,320
the demands of the of the business it's

00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,720
a great book and it's really really

00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,690
funny okay so you should you should read

00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,020
that that

00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,970
Phoenix project book by Jin Kim also you

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,590
know and one of the the leaders of the

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,500
devil's movement movement and what you

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,450
hear in the Phoenix project is a lot

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,130
about the culture that you know we need

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,290
in a company to be able to face this

00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:19,350
because what are we trying to do we are

00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,910
trying to bring value to the company ok

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:23,220
we are trying to bring value to the

00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:26,490
customers we used to have what a full

00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,760
model design you build your release and

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:31,110
the value comes much later in the game

00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,060
so now everything we're trying to do of

00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:35,010
course you know this by going agile and

00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,630
so on we're trying to bring value every

00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,070
step of the way and we trying to

00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,170
reiterate so thanks to container

00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:42,360
solution for this slide that just

00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,970
arrived on Twitter like three days ago I

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,560
thought it was great

00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:48,990
micro-services you know again it's a new

00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,270
it's a new idea of but you know how you

00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:54,360
create your application how you manage

00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:56,340
your application but the underlying you

00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:00,030
know idea is that it brings you value

00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:02,730
even much faster ok so that's what we do

00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:05,370
we bring value to our customers whether

00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:08,040
they're internal or external so the

00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,680
principles we work as self-organizing

00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,410
team we're not silos you know we don't

00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,330
throw jar files you know across the wall

00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:19,040
like this you know it's not basketball

00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:22,290
or volleyball yeah it's not volleyball

00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,900
but we work a self-organizing team we

00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:27,210
have empathy between devs and ups ok

00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:30,090
definitely big thing we definitely ver

00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:31,620
value early and continuously that's the

00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,420
reason why we're using some of those

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,610
tools is to be able to deliver that

00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,310
value and then continuously you know

00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:40,470
keep on keep on doing it but the main

00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:43,770
point is that we have to solve customers

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:46,230
problems and I used to hate that term

00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,820
customer because I was in academia and

00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,820
you don't do anything from money in

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,080
academia so I was like users ok but

00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,850
that's fine let's call it let's call

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,920
them customers and they can be internal

00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:57,510
they can be they can be external ok and

00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:02,100
you know sometimes you don't make them

00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:04,860
pay so we bring we solve customers

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:09,060
problems that's what we do so I went

00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:10,880
back to to agile ok I'm I'm certified

00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:14,160
scrum master yeah

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:18,870
thank you thank you I rarely use it but

00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:21,630
I went through the training I went back

00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,530
to the agile manifesto okay you can go

00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,000
you can search it

00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,880
I shall manifesto what do you see in the

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,890
agile manifesto individuals and

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,870
interaction working software bla bla bla

00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,429
what's interesting that the one line I

00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:35,520
wanted to get out of the agile manifesto

00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:38,880
is we choose individuals and

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,500
interactions over processes and tools so

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,750
that's more in the context of how do we

00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,429
work together do we use Kanban do we put

00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,640
post-its and things like this but we

00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:50,730
choose this over tools so you know we're

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,290
not about we know the invoice shop or we

00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,450
know the Kuban a tea shop or we know the

00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:57,750
docker shop okay we're not focusing on

00:30:54,450 --> 00:31:01,290
tools we need to focus on solutions and

00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:03,150
and you know not not the tools so

00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,429
remember DevOps we're not here to build

00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:08,400
cool software we're not here to be hip

00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:10,800
we're here to provide solutions you know

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,570
while having fun okay we have to find

00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,970
this balance it's all about finding a

00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,710
balance between you know using

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:20,790
cutting-edge software that we may need

00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:22,679
to actually fix a problem but you know

00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,830
we cannot just add that software because

00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:29,460
you know it's the cool thing to do and

00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:31,350
Chris you know boy turds I was I was

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,970
talking with him and it's been it's been

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,790
much more aggressive in this message

00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:38,370
recently in Europe so you should look up

00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,620
his SlideShare account Chris buttered

00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,809
he's written several talks you know the

00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:45,570
return of the dull stack engineer and

00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:47,760
the dull stack engineer is not something

00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,220
is not some someone who knows the entire

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,320
landscape because nobody can know that

00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,870
landscape Atlee and definitely not in

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,880
depth but a dull stack engineer is

00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:59,940
somebody who knows maybe three or four

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,210
solutions but knows them in depth and

00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,850
then really can master them and you know

00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:08,600
bring that solution bring that value to

00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:10,740
the customer is the dud stack engineer

00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,290
the problem is that the dual stack

00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,870
engineer is not cool that's the that's

00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:18,720
the big problem and then he started

00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:21,120
writing a another talk which is Mobius

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,790
killing your DevOps effort mobi being

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,330
you know the new docker you know project

00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,160
mobi

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,990
killing your DevOps effort and it's

00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,120
nothing again against you know against

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:33,240
against docker it's just that when

00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:35,160
docker arrived they promised you know

00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,450
lots of things that production-ready and

00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,200
then it's going to solve lots of

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:42,510
problems and so on but people started

00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,640
using it in the wrong ways and instead

00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:46,320
of throwing jar file across the net they

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,450
started throwing containers across the

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,870
net it didn't solve anything we still

00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:54,390
had silos okay so it really didn't help

00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:56,610
the your DevOps you know movement in

00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:58,650
your in your companies so personally

00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:03,900
what do I do to be able to you know face

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:05,660
that onslaught of software I do research

00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,730
because that's what I was doing before

00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:11,280
so I you know I I tried to figure this

00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:13,920
things out I do a lot of of Google and

00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,470
then I stumble into this paper and I had

00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,900
no idea it existed you guys know the

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,870
mythical man-month who knows the

00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,580
mythical man-month okay not enough

00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,130
people I think we should all read the

00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:29,270
mythical man-month okay you Yuri says

00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:31,800
yes okay mythical man-month is you know

00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,170
your software project is late let's

00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,180
throw more engineers at it you know and

00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,590
it's going to solve the problem and no

00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,510
it's not going to solve the problem if

00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,370
you throw more engineers at it it's

00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:44,040
actually going to delay your project

00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:50,280
okay

00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:55,710
that was published in 75 1975 I was born

00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:58,650
I was one and then in 95 they published

00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:01,680
an anniversary as part of the 20 year

00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:04,650
book there is this paper no silver

00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:08,550
bullet and it basically says there are

00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:11,160
no silver bullets in Nike okay no single

00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:13,050
software or new management technique can

00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:17,640
give you a huge increase in productivity

00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:20,700
reliability and simplicity in span of 10

00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,410
years there are no silver bullet and I

00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,790
really believe in this so when when

00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:26,010
people come up and they're like oh I

00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,790
have very opinionated opinionated

00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,470
solution

00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,690
you know you should do things like this

00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:32,340
and things like that and you know that's

00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,640
the way to go and it's going to solve

00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:37,899
all your problems I'm like no it's not

00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,999
gonna work there are no silver bullets

00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:42,839
okay there are solutions to specific

00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:45,069
problems but there are no silver bullet

00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:47,200
so that's that's one of the things that

00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:48,940
I keep in mind no silver bullet so be

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,249
extremely careful when people talk about

00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,409
silver bullets and then you know one

00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:55,269
thing is that software and systems they

00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:59,259
do not come out of thin air you know

00:34:55,269 --> 00:35:03,249
it's just like Oh talker or cubing it is

00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:04,599
you know it's not magic okay so I want

00:35:03,249 --> 00:35:07,150
to take communities leave it as an

00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:09,009
example here and what I like to do is

00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:11,619
like you know study the system and

00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:13,809
understand why why where does this come

00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:16,630
from how is this linked to other other

00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:19,180
technologies and so on and some Ramji

00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:21,539
who was the the director of the cloud

00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:24,220
friendly foundation he had this slide

00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:25,839
this diagram I actually put this diagram

00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,369
in a slide I couldn't find the original

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,490
so I took a snapshot of a previous slide

00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:32,950
to put it in this slide but that's the

00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:35,140
lineage of kubernetes and also

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,420
containers and I do a lot of cuban

00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,339
cheese training and i always you know

00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,450
show this diagram because when people

00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:42,400
ask me well why do you choose

00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:44,069
communities and like let's let's look

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,829
where the technology is coming from

00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:50,859
google was working on borg you know as a

00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:53,259
system to manage Gmail and Google Apps

00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:55,059
and and everything it was the internal

00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:57,819
system it was a secret for a long time

00:35:55,059 --> 00:36:01,480
they were using containers from the

00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:04,180
start so if the start being 99 for them

00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,739
you know 99 2000 there was new VMs at

00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,140
that time so they went straight up to

00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:11,079
containers they wanted to efficiently

00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,430
use their big clusters or at least the

00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,549
clusters that would they were they were

00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:17,410
putting up starting to put together so

00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:19,210
they went to containers and they started

00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:22,359
developing a system to orchestrate

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,950
containers five minutes they invented C

00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:25,900
groups they gave C groups to the Linux

00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:29,499
kernel with C groups you can constraint

00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:32,049
processes C groups you put Linux name

00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:34,690
faces on it network name space file

00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:36,249
system namespace IP C name space blank

00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,499
blank blank you end up with containers

00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:40,930
you have Alexi docker shows up

00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:42,160
what does docker do really really good

00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,170
on them and that's the one thing we

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,099
should learn from docker empathy with

00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:50,690
the users the LXE interface was actually

00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:52,670
quite difficult to use and

00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:54,470
darker empathy for the users they

00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,569
basically write a much better user

00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:58,490
experience on top of containers so that

00:36:56,569 --> 00:37:00,410
was really really good that's why they

00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:03,560
want but it was basically a layer on top

00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:05,900
of Alexi and then rocket arrived and it

00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,480
gave an OC I open container initiatives

00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,490
and so on so you start seeing our hold

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,730
those texts are linked to each other on

00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:15,680
the orchestration side missiles the guys

00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:18,500
who created missiles they were actually

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,150
inspired by discussions with Google so

00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,710
they were talking with the guys from

00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:24,230
Google you know about how do you

00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:26,420
efficiently schedule workloads in your

00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,190
data center and Google say well you need

00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,500
a multi level scheduler you need to work

00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:32,119
to write framework so that you can you

00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,890
know efficiently put this and then

00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,869
allocate resources from this guy and

00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:39,109
then schedule here so that's how they

00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:41,000
invented mesos okay cloud foundry was

00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:43,250
created by a guy named Eric coalition

00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,800
who was at Google so the twelve factor

00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:49,940
pass stuff is actually invented or

00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:52,609
created you know by by Google ideas and

00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:56,030
Cuban itis is a rewrite in the open of

00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:57,530
Borg so this all you know makes sense to

00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:59,510
me you need to understand where the

00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,819
technology is coming from you know a

00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:04,730
little bit of history of how things came

00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:08,000
came to be so when I looked at all of

00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:11,839
this as like okay hold on Cuba this is a

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,780
rewrite in the open of Borg the Google

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,140
compute engine the Google cloud actually

00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,730
runs on top of Borg or let's say Google

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,839
is managing GCE

00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:28,030
using board so that means that Google is

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:31,730
actually running VMs inside containers

00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:34,339
yeah and I was like oh so I have Cuban

00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:36,980
eighties so Cuban teas is going to kill

00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:40,400
OpenStack I don't tweet that because

00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,690
otherwise I'm gonna get killed but and I

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,730
was like oh that's interesting

00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:46,310
Cuban teas could be a virtual machine

00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:49,460
Orchestrator it's also going to kill

00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:51,650
cloud cloud stack so I did a little puck

00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:54,859
and you can do it it's extremely easy

00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:57,530
okay you can actually run a KVM process

00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:59,210
inside a docker container you mount the

00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,520
write volumes the FK VM

00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:04,150
inside the container and now you're

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,790
running a VM inside a container

00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,470
and Cuban itis is orchestrating your VMs

00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,990
that's exactly what you're doing with

00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:13,480
OpenStack or cloud stack okay

00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,760
so I wrote that blog in 2005 and I'm

00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,200
like okay this all makes sense thanks to

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,850
me and even though I was working on

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,400
cloud stack I was like you know this is

00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:23,050
great why this was great and I thought

00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:27,730
it was really really good it's because

00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:30,070
it's AWS at open source ec2 back in 2006

00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,890
we wouldn't have had OpenStack or cloud

00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:36,400
stack or yuca okay we will we would all

00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:38,590
have used the AWS solution of course you

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,180
know for competitive standpoint you know

00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,310
they didn't they didn't do that and then

00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:46,450
we ended up with the the VM Orchestrator

00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:48,520
war you know that's that that's life but

00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:52,390
that's why I jumped on communities and I

00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:54,160
mentioned this because you know you need

00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:57,100
to understand where the tech comes from

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,500
and wide you know it has it has arrived

00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:03,100
to this point and then you know when

00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:05,680
when docker came out you know I knew I

00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:10,450
knew about containers that use openvz

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:13,180
before we had we had used containers

00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:15,910
before we had open Solaris we had

00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,710
Solaris zones you know in production

00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:19,300
where I was at Purdue University and I

00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,220
was like okay white white containers why

00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:24,250
are people going crazy about containers

00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:25,780
and instead of being like a hater you

00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:28,090
know I said okay I need to pay attention

00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,670
to this I need to figure out why people

00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:32,140
are going crazy about containers very

00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,690
much like you know right now like I

00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:37,360
mentioned envoi and no idea why I'm

00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:40,180
picking on Android okay but we need to

00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,100
start understanding why are people using

00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,780
and why why do they think and what is

00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,700
interesting it's just a little bit of

00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,920
research so you know for me I was like

00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,900
okay I have connections with O'Reilly

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,390
let me write a book on docker and I used

00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:55,570
the book to actually learn what docker

00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:57,640
was okay the bottom line is that we need

00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,500
to adapt and that's the culture that we

00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,840
need to have in our organization we need

00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:05,680
to have a way that you know we can adapt

00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:07,600
without you know huge crisis and and be

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,610
able to adapt the infrastructure be able

00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,800
to adapt the tools all the time and it

00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,710
doesn't mean adopt it doesn't mean that

00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,430
we we need to jump and adopt every new

00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,680
software out there okay

00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,170
so we need to develop a culture of

00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,550
adaptation adaptation not sure if

00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:25,310
adaptation is the right word but anyway

00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:27,740
and you get it with the hood a loop you

00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:30,140
know Adrienne khakhra from Netflix is a

00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:33,080
big big fan of this I think it also

00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:34,760
makes sense for your organization as it

00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,040
needs to adapt you need to observe

00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,770
what's happening in the industry then

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,480
orient decide and you may decide not to

00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,190
adapt containers you may decide not to

00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,350
adapt abilities but at least you know

00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:47,660
why it's there where it comes from and

00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:49,900
and then you are making an informed

00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,250
decision this is all common sense okay I

00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,200
think I'm gonna I'm gonna skip the

00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:56,690
example about docker and this is not a

00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,760
lot to criticize docker it was just an

00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:01,430
example about you know how you can look

00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,810
at docker and then adapt to it for me

00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,160
when I started looking at this and

00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,440
trying to learn about it you know you

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,180
have you have big questions that you

00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,440
need to ask yourself where are the

00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,690
images coming from

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,670
what what libraries are in those

00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,890
containers what's the size of the image

00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,600
because you know at the beginning you

00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,670
were downloading an image it was a full

00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,890
Linux distribution and it was you know

00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,560
some images where like 1 to 3 gigabytes

00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,480
like you gotta be kidding this is not

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,160
this is not a better way to do things we

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,640
can do better even with just a little

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,380
bit of Python ok so you know you need to

00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,060
look at things you need to look at the

00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,130
tooling around those solution docker

00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:41,030
machine when I looked at dr. machine at

00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:43,280
the time you know it was just a wrapper

00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:45,860
that was talking to AWS it was just

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,570
there was just a little client creating

00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,180
a security group launching and address

00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:52,430
instance creating SSH keys that that was

00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,760
what dr. machine was but yet people got

00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:57,830
crazy about docker machine yeah so we

00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,370
need to look at this and then the big

00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:03,410
thing is avoid the stars syndrome you

00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,480
know github is all about social sharing

00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:08,660
everything is on everything is on get up

00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,150
please avoid the Stars syndrome the top

00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:14,740
one is communities 28,000 stars the

00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:17,270
bottom one that cloud stack 503 stars

00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,770
the reason I'm putting it on there is

00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:21,170
because it's very interesting look at

00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:24,050
cloud stack is that it has 500 stars but

00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:26,060
it has 600 clones there's more clones

00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:28,130
than stars I challenge you to find

00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,890
another project on github that has more

00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,539
clones than stars

00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:35,869
now usually you have less than 10%

00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:38,509
clones per stars so avoid the star

00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:40,009
syndromes why because software go viral

00:43:38,509 --> 00:43:42,709
this is something that we did at bitNami

00:43:40,009 --> 00:43:44,650
it's it's a little Debian image I don't

00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:47,150
want you to use it you can just use the

00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:50,269
traditional Debian image something

00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:53,299
happened like a months ago how can use

00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:56,989
thread went viral and we gained 700

00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:59,269
stars or 600 stars in 24 hours stars

00:43:56,989 --> 00:44:01,130
don't mean users doesn't mean adoption

00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:02,390
it just means that something on Hacker

00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,979
News went crazy

00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:06,229
and then people went to your side and I

00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:08,630
meant agree baby you know like a

00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:10,789
Christmas tree okay but it doesn't tell

00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:12,170
you if it's a good software so don't

00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:13,819
forget you're building solutions for

00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:16,339
your business you need to develop a

00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:18,140
culture that adapts to change tools will

00:44:16,339 --> 00:44:19,699
not break your silos so even if you

00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,380
adapt docker it's not going to break

00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,670
your silos it's not going to really help

00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,459
you with DevOps if you don't do

00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:29,859
something stay curious be critical not

00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:29,859
