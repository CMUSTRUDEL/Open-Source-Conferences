my name is Max and I'm going to tell you

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,660
how we hire a series of page duty in

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,610
five minutes of course your mileage and

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,289
timing may vary and what works for us

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,820
will not necessarily work out for you

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,380
but let's start with a simple question

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,570
what is a sorry

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,550
like the verbs the meaning of a sorry

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,500
can be different for every company at

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,500
pages duty with those three things we

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,970
operate shared infrastructure we build

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,399
self-service tools and continuous

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,620
delivery pipelines and we advise our

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,000
product teams here are some of the

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,370
things that we do not do in the

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,410
organization a sorry or a senior team

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,510
might have to do some or all of those

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,070
things as well and those like are not

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,719
exclusive with DevOps like you can do

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,899
the offs and do that and not do their

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,079
works and still have an authority a page

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,969
of duty sre has soft power only so human

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,219
skills are crucial for us technical

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,120
issues that we face frankly are often

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,059
not that complex

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,890
it is a preservation and education and

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,379
empathy that takes a lot of effort and

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,450
it's not easy to automate the way this

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,010
is our humans of requirements lease for

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,860
a nursery we do not have a dedicated

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,380
interview slot for most of those except

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,880
the eats foods part that's lunch but a

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,860
lot of those skills are used during the

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,130
technical sessions so we can get an idea

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,170
of how good someone really is here's the

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,970
technical areas of expertise expertise

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,700
for a team no one is expected to be a

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,200
master of all of those areas but it's

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,270
good to have baseline knowledge of all

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,430
and then a deep knowledge of one or more

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,549
and this is also called the t-shaped or

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,350
content people in some places as an

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,000
example this is a deep dive into one of

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,860
the topics from a previous slide it

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,170
covers both specific systems that we

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,509
currently use for example a chip boxes

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,770
along bouncer and general concepts for

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,740
example do you know what a Brewer

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,960
theorem is the skills you need will be

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,880
different tomorrow the vision of where

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,340
your tech stack and company are going

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,500
should inform your hiring decisions and

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,049
you should looking for people who scale

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,430
10x from where you are today on the

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,189
technologies that you want to be running

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,990
not where you are today for 100

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,750
engineers or so this is what our team

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,330
looks like I like the diversity of the

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,760
experience level and Ben

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,560
on our team makes for lively debate at

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,950
times and also means there are many

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,080
chances for learning and teaching the

00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,270
focus our hiring we did this exercise of

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,160
looking what the current team can do and

00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,200
what skills do we need the most and

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,180
cannot easily borrow from elsewhere in

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,040
the company this is an example for a

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,730
company that wants to do CV but doesn't

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,770
really have the expertise in it why is

00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,200
this a great job description example

00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,940
it's simple it has a small number of key

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,800
requirements like feeding the fish and

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,720
it doesn't say you can only use unstable

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,790
to do it then it gives facts about

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,390
existing infrastructure so you know what

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,980
are you getting into as salaries are in

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,080
high demand what can you do if you

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,000
cannot confirm or money most companies

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,070
still require full time on-site for a

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,380
job that can be done well remotely and

00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,840
they have a unicorn skill wishlist of

00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,810
what's really important so you can avoid

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,580
that a service can develop from diverse

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,950
backgrounds the original Google

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,170
definition of that is software engineers

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,660
who are tasked with operations but

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,880
people coming from an Operations system

00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,420
engineering and QA can bring their own

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,980
unique advantages to the table this is

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,050
our interview process we start with a

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,570
phone conversation followed by a full

00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,520
day of on-site interviewing with

00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,100
sessions on both human and technical

00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:34,459
skills and we want to make sure all the

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,290
candidates have a good experience every

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,480
interview slot is between 30 minutes and

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,340
one hour long and focuses on one

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,920
particular topic the best slot

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,410
composition is a mix of a discussion or

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,070
white design and also some hands-on

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,709
tasks the best discussion questions are

00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,350
open-ended they do not test trivia and

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,520
they let the discussion flow freely

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,500
following the answers from the candidate

00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,970
and the goal is to establish depths and

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,570
boundaries of knowledge on a particular

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:04,760
topic we try to incorporate hands-on

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,260
into as many slots as possible

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,060
candidates will be writing called

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,580
configuring machines and so on from

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,769
their laptops most questions are open

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,730
book candidates can search in the

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:17,959
internet for anything that might help

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,000
when you start form and shift to make

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,190
interviewing playgrounds each candidate

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,360
gets a fresh isolated environment with

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,380
multiple machines with the new

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,330
credentials for us it is a

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,480
simple as doing made before and make

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,700
clean after we would score each slot

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,500
from one to five with one being out quit

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,870
if you hire them and five being out quit

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,850
if you don't after hearing all the slots

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,110
the vote is repeated but three is no

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,030
longer allowed you have to make an

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,880
opinion that in the end the hiring

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,100
manager Mexico well this is how we do it

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,540
I would love to hear a feedback and talk

00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,520
about the differences in our processes

00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,110
pager Duty is a digital operations

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,370
management platform and like everybody

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,370
else will hire thank you

00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,669
