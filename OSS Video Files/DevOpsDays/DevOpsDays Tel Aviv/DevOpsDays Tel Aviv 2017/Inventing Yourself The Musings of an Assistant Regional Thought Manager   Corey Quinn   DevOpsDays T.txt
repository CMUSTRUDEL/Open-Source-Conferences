00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:12,330
there have been a lot of conversations

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,580
debates arguments about whether or not

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,150
DevOps is about culture whether it's

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,310
about tools from my perspective it tends

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,310
to be about empathy so whenever I find

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,500
myself wondering what the heck is going

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,119
on why I'm reacting so negatively to a

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,830
talk I'm trying to go a little deeper

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,469
and figure that out so we'll get there

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:36,329
first a little bit about me the past

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,879
eight nine months I've been writing a

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,040
weekly newsletter last week in AWS which

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,570
solves two problems the first is that

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,460
there's a lot of information coming out

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,559
of Amazon's cloud that's hard to keep up

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,930
with and nothing filters it out the

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,390
second is that people don't make fun of

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,079
Amazon enough and I do my level best to

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,899
fix that every week in addition to that

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,000
I also run a consultancy for the past

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,629
year that solves exactly one problem I

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,299
fixed the horrifying AWS bill there's a

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:09,210
github project the open guide to AWS

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,650
that makes fun of things and recite the

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,930
gathers all the various interesting

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,880
information around the things we wish we

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,920
knew and explains that huh that's not

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,369
enough let's keep going I also have a

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,100
daughter she's lovely and wonderful I

00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:24,780
used to thank you I spent the better

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,150
part of a decade helping around the free

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,189
node IRC network as Chiron mentioned I'm

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,869
one of the organizers here huh that's

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,060
still not enough why don't I put my

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:38,100
entire goddamn resume up on the slide

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,930
and explain what's next there are a lot

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,880
of talks we're at the beginning of it

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,310
people go through their entire resume

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,560
what they've done what they do what they

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,960
what they stand for and I found myself

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,200
getting more and more annoyed by it from

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,790
a position of why are you doing this

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,119
it's not interesting it's not helpful

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,979
get to the point and the reason that

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,759
I've discovered that people do it is

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:05,159
that we're all to some extent afraid

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,069
that we're somehow not worthy to have

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,929
this conversation I mean let me give you

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,180
a more concrete example here a year ago

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,700
when I started my consultancy

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,829
I've rapidly became considered an expert

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,569
at things all things Amazon based on

00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:21,629
very little more than the fact that I

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:24,150
said I was and no one questioned it and

00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:26,549
if you don't ask the same dumb question

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,140
twice and there's this myth that we have

00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:30,840
the people who get up on stage are

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,560
somehow years and years ahead of the

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,370
rest of us we hope to be 15 minutes

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,349
ahead

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,500
most days we're about a sentence and a

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:45,239
half it's not about being light-years

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,500
and worlds apart it's really not so the

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,209
problem is is getting up here and

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,010
talking about stuff for the longest time

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,750
I always felt like a giant fraud which

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,629
is why these talks open with these

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,310
things and when I talk to other people

00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,650
about this like every time I get on

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,689
stage I feel like a fraud the answer is

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,950
almost universally been the same of oh

00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:06,450
my god thank you I thought it was me and

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,700
people like to complain I'm as guilty as

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,200
anyone about talks that go on and on at

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,609
the beginning about what the speaker

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,709
does it they think it's self

00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:16,650
aggrandizement but I'm starting to see

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,629
it very differently it's a constant

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,250
battle against the voices in our head

00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,669
that tell us that we're not good enough

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,230
to be doing the thing that we're doing

00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:27,900
speaking is hard we all struggle with

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,530
this every talk I give I am scared to

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,510
death right before I go onstage and

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,739
today included it's nerve-wracking to

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,859
get up here in front of a bunch of

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,109
people who could tear me to pieces so a

00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,979
lot of us trying to yourself justify

00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:43,739
ourselves

00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:46,620
we're generally not

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:50,879
intentionally we're humble for the most

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,949
part but there are exceptions and as the

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,959
rest of talk is gonna be about so I'm

00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:57,449
gonna leave these a company logos up on

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,900
the slide back for a minute because it

00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,900
builds credibility

00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:07,230
I don't work at any of these companies

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,450
but you're gonna start to believe that

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,600
I'm speaking with their authority if I

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,130
leave that up there so think for a

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
minute about what my production

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:20,070
environment probably looks like and my

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,210
code it is a goddamn paradise now think

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,290
for a minute about what your code

00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:30,470
environment looks like it's a shattered

00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:32,460
hellscape how are you even in business

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,960
about this time you're probably

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,610
considering it's time to give up and go

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,900
raise goats on a farm somewhere okay

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,210
let's get those logos back up there to

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,040
shore up my credibility someone now

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,440
obviously

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,450
I'm far better than you are and your

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,560
team's because I might theoretically

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,430
work at one of these companies and

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,370
that's messed up

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,220
and I've been thinking about this for a

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,290
while until it crystallized for me late

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,930
last year when I went to a conference

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,470
and I saw a talk that convinced me to

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:10,110
build this one this is the actual talk

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,240
Club and credit were do it is an amazing

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,830
talk the speaker is eloquent he tells a

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,060
funny story things work well and it was

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,360
a good talk it was subtle

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,960
it was nuanced and it made some very

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,160
good points that for better or worse

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,260
sailed over the head of some of the

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,290
audience members it had some great lines

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,570
in the talk for example they mentioned

00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:37,320
that at Netflix all developers have root

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:41,040
in production you may gasp at this I

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,090
gasped at this please gasp thank you

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,430
that was the audience participation

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,200
portion and the reason behind it made

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,310
sense in that one of their cultural

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,540
tenets at Netflix

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,130
is that they trust people cool that

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,350
works this ties back to the Netflix

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,210
cultural tenant of freedom and

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,040
responsibility they're huge on this they

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,750
talk about it all the time and this

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,250
stuff sounds really compelling and

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,680
awesome the first time that you see it

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,690
and people are getting into it the guy

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,340
next to me wants to give his devs route

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,990
and production he's like you I could see

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,090
doing this and I look at his name

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:16,500
tagging oh my god he works at a

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:20,360
Bank excuse me while I make some

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,190
personal banking changes myself so

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:30,630
either that guy missed something or I

00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:32,100
did but what we'll get back to that this

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,020
seems like an opportune time for us to

00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,240
talk about indigenous cultures in the

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,360
Pacific Islands it's a pretty straight

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,240
shot segue there specifically in the

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,570
1930s and 1940s what war is broken out

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,430
on a global scale and these islands have

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,229
suddenly become staging areas for the

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,180
largest armies the world has ever seen

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:53,550
and this is a true story I'm not

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,080
embellishing here so what happened was

00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,919
is that folks hadn't seen anything like

00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,270
this before

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,460
they had islands that had been peaceful

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,990
and relatively deserted suddenly had

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,270
airports go up in a matter of days and

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:08,010
supplies started coming in like crazy

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:10,710
and this happened repeatedly so they did

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,810
what any of us would do they went to

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,250
hacker news and decided to reinvent

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,900
everything they were seeing from first

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,530
principles and an incomplete grasp of

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,150
the situation and they see airports get

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,270
built and then they see all these

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:28,440
valuable awesome Goods coming in bounty

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:31,349
from the skies hmm and they built models

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,820
of airports and airplanes hoping that

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:34,200
all right if we build some of this stuff

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,250
we'll start getting some of that free

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:41,310
bounty too it didn't really work as well

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,080
as they had hoped and this is called a

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,849
cargo cult yes it's real

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,030
and it what happened was is these

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:50,280
Islanders confused cause and effect

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,050
airports didn't need supplies in the

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,430
sense that it was oh that supplies was

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,960
waiting to come down until an airport

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,970
shows up they were built to get the

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,550
supplies in it was a causality problem

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:02,190
where they would cherry-pick from what

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,770
they saw and hope to get results based

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,330
upon an incomplete understanding

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:09,780
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:13,110
and to bring that metaphor back around

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,520
and to avoid a context we are all likely

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,780
to do it ourselves there's no real

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,820
defense against this other than

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,340
vigilance because these Islanders

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,110
weren't stupid and neither was the

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,240
person from the bank sitting next to me

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,970
at that conference

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,669
they missed the larger context of World

00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:31,160
War two which happens and its

00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:32,899
accompanying logistics and the person

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,110
next to me missed the context of

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:37,700
Netflix's constraints and capabilities

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:41,020
there were a lot of good things in these

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,610
talks but the trick is to apply context

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,010
so to go back to Netflix's point here

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,200
and fill in some missing context that

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,270
the audience member missed and to be

00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,339
fair the big tech companies are kind of

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:56,060
weak themselves at filling in a lot of

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:57,649
these contextual terms and clues it's an

00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,899
addition to the form of slogans I've

00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:02,180
made up for Netflix based upon things

00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:04,070
I've seen and conversations with people

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,750
there they're famous for not hiring

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,339
junior people they want people to go

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,620
into the industry learn how to do things

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:12,980
and then they come in and after they had

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,290
a decade of experience or so so who here

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,470
has been junior somewhere and broke

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:21,740
production yeah if your hand isn't

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,870
raised I don't know I did when I started

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,540
I wound up screwing up at our sink flag

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,310
I copied it from a cron job I didn't

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,600
understand into a staging environment

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,180
and that was great

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,190
someone left a production net up mounted

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,550
it's why is this taking longer than oh

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,649
my god and you dive for ctrl C and get

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:43,610
it get it to stop in as fast as you can

00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:45,410
and okay you I screamed for help I mean

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:49,550
the DevOps signal looks a lot like this

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:51,500
and yeah it's like you're drowning and I

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,450
learned a lot from that moment where it

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,250
was okay that's not good

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,440
two days later the VP calls me into his

00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,880
office shut the door have a seat oh one

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,490
of those conversations this is how I get

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,520
fired and he said do you know what you

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:07,610
did yeah is it ever going to happen

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,050
again like no well not like that exactly

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,750
but I have some other deer's ideas how I

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,130
can break things it's like good I just

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,140
want to make sure you understood this

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,459
Harry what happened and the context

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,190
behind it but you're doing a great job

00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:21,770
keep it up this happens and that was

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,529
life-changing I learned a lot from that

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,959
moment and I mean these days I'm not

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:29,990
nearly as careless or as junior as I was

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,720
back then and back that Netflix wouldn't

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,550
hire me and now theoretically they might

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,050
accept the fact where I give a talk that

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,050
pretty much puts the boots to them

00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:43,369
something else that Netflix tends to do

00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:45,469
famously is they pay absolute top of

00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:46,939
market salaries even by Bay Area

00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:49,639
standards that we're talking enormous

00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:51,379
piles of money and as a result this

00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,299
enables them to do a number of things

00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:55,819
like screen not just for technical

00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:57,559
talent but for good judgement when

00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:59,719
people go through the Netflix culture

00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:01,279
deck and rip off different things to try

00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:02,959
in their own company it's like you have

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,769
freedom and responsibility you ever

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,389
noticed they don't steal this one we're

00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:10,099
just gonna hurl money at people and see

00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:12,159
what happens is not something startups

00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:15,709
like to try for whatever reason and

00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,209
ultimately with failure modes you won't

00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,039
well hang on before I get well actually

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,169
to death by someone from Netflix who

00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,629
reads this and I hang on a sec okay fine

00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:28,219
yes you do original content great the

00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:29,989
point being is that unless you're in a

00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:32,209
place where if their failure mode is

00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:34,279
fundamental that movies don't stream

00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:37,369
anymore and that's okay oh heavens the

00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,689
worst case here is we go outside the

00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:39,889
problem here is that the failure mode is

00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:42,139
very different than the bank if you

00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:44,509
can't stream the latest episode of

00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:46,879
stranger things it's a different place

00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:49,339
on the scale of do we riot in the

00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,169
streets or not then the bank the ATM is

00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:53,419
now spitting out everyone's bank balance

00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:55,309
incorrectly now you may decide that that

00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:56,749
winds up being very different for a

00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:59,329
we're on the scale that falls for you

00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:01,999
personally but we're not gonna be

00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:05,179
judgment about that the fact is is that

00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:08,179
fundamentally neither yeah everyone's

00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:09,470
environment is awful I've gone out for

00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:11,029
drinks with people from all of the

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,309
companies whose logo is I put on the

00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:15,259
slide and everyone yeah it must be

00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:18,739
amazing to work there and they slam a

00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:22,089
drink back oh it's terrible and everyone

00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:26,299
talks privately about these things

00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:28,519
everything sucks it's awful and no one

00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:33,769
talks about the bad parts when they get

00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:35,179
up on stage I tried to but the talks

00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:36,709
exception committee hears you can't vote

00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:39,090
for your own talk turned down my other

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:42,040
talk that I wanted to give

00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,050
they said that a talk titled that my

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,450
environment is a is not

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:49,000
uplifting enough they said it was too

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,710
depressing they said they didn't even

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,330
have a children's track here no I

00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,680
couldn't start one with that talk and

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,240
the fact that I even suggest that it

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,470
made them question having me come here

00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,910
at all hey get out I digress the point

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,710
is is that all of our terrible tire

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,960
fires environments are like that for a

00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:07,360
reason because we are all shaped by

00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,190
constraints no none of us have the

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,080
budget to hurl enormous piles of money

00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,330
at everyone there are time money

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,040
resources business goals strategies

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,630
things companies care about that's

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,640
shaped the course of what you can do and

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:21,660
we're all trying to do more with less

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,100
the best that we can

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,680
unless you're Travis kalanick the former

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,240
CEO of uber nobody shows up to work in

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:33,640
this morning hoping to do a shitty job

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:37,570
today we all want to do a good job but

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,210
we have constraints and the point is is

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,740
that these constraints shape our choices

00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,910
my constraints aren't yours and when I

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,100
get up and talk about what I'm doing

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,480
technically it's rare that I as a

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,030
speaker will talk about my own

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,410
constraints much less the ones that you

00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,300
may have in your environment that I

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,190
don't see it's easy to paint an

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,810
aspirational story of how things might

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,090
be but it doesn't always work that

00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,590
neatly in the real world with a couple

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,320
exceptions of people here who are more

00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:06,100
machine than human the speaker on stage

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,510
is a person and when you get up here and

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,880
tell stories about how amazing

00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,380
kubernetes is or how to build containers

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,480
that's great and it works for our

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,340
environments as any of the ideas that

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,350
it's an inspiration to give you ideas

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,410
not a step-by-step paint-by-numbers

00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:22,000
blueprint of what you should do and as

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:27,300
speakers sometimes we get it wrong and

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,160
we're fallible and sometimes so are you

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,700
it's not always the speaker who gets up

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,490
at a conference that's the problem

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,430
sometimes it comes from the audience

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:42,340
sometimes the problem is one of you I

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:44,320
have an example so five years ago I went

00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,830
to a great talk at a conference that was

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,810
fun and nuanced it was a genuinely good

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,950
talk on the idea of building golden

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,720
images versus managing to

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,730
in place via content via configuration

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,340
management and it was good in its own

00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,960
merits not only because the docker

00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,610
docker docker craze hadn't hit you'd

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,020
never see a condescending

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,880
telling you you were doing it wrong that

00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,040
was still a year or two in the future it

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,930
was great so the speaker from the

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,400
Department of Energy at the United

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,430
States admitted that they were giving

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,740
their first talk and sharing what they

00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,780
were doing around how to manage and

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,360
deploy systems and it went really well

00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,790
right up until the Q&A portion at the

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,860
end of the slide and does anyone have a

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,260
question and oh thank god someone does

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,060
yes you sir that condescending looking

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,510
gentleman in the back what's your

00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:36,710
question and the question was that's not

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:38,810
how we do it at Google so let's unpack

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:42,140
this short sentence like the remarkable

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:44,090
 onion that it is in fact let's

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,760
segue for a second entirely here I'm

00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,710
going to help you all out now as a

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,820
speaker I have certain responsibilities

00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:54,710
that I have to fulfill I have to build a

00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,720
talk that at least vaguely resembles

00:15:54,710 --> 00:16:00,950
what I said I was going to talk about

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,020
you think sorry Sharon I have to show up

00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:06,290
on time which in Israel is sometimes a

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,180
bit of a challenge and there's a usually

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,740
not in Israel but most other conferences

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,930
there's a remarkably strict please wear

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,060
pants policy that needs to be objected

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,070
they observe and as an audience you've

00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:20,480
got responsibilities when attending a

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:23,120
conference talk as well one of them is

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,590
asking good questions at the end so let

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,540
me help you out here this works not just

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,400
for this talk but every talk you ever go

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:32,630
to with a list of things that aren't

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,460
questions for starters calling

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,740
on the entire premise of the talk while

00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,220
in the case of me is remarkably accurate

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,070
it still isn't a question

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:46,280
and neither is telling a pointless story

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:48,110
that doesn't tie in any way to what the

00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,600
talk was about unless it's necessary

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,940
somehow to to build up to make your

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,870
question make sense and if it is for

00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:59,540
God's sake keep it brief and your resume

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,120
is never a question you wouldn't think

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,250
I'd have to say this I have to say this

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,920
and what's remarkable is that that's

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,530
not how we do things at Google hits all

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:13,610
three of those points in one short

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:18,439
question it's an amazing compression

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:20,600
ratio I know a condescending engineer

00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:25,040
who works at Google try to suspend your

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,660
disbelief it happened and again as I

00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,310
mentioned this was not helped by the

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,310
fact that it was this poor speakers

00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:35,510
first talk he'd never given one before

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:38,150
he is visibly nervous and we're talking

00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,010
shaking knees the sweats I get it we all

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,480
have been there so you recognize it miss

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,130
and you're pulling for someone no one

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,470
wants to see a speaker floundering

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,270
onstage and I'm a little jealous of

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,800
watching people pick on this guy cuz no

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,660
one does that with me for whatever

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,610
reason no one comes up there and tries

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,510
to call on me which really

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,900
would probably make the world a better

00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,580
place

00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,200
and the reason behind that is that my

00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,170
talks don't actually solve anyone's real

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,110
problems but that's fine I want to

00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:05,420
address the merits of the objective

00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,600
question that was asked rather than the

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:12,740
shitty delivery do these two things look

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:15,740
alike to anyone else for those who are

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:18,410
unaware of what they do the Department

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,940
of Energy doesn't a lot of things and

00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,770
for the guy who has just tapped to run

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,990
it apparently has no idea what it does

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,670
and that's great but they do a lot of

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,290
important things they manage the nuclear

00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:29,690
arsenal they do a tremendous amount of

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,250
work with supercomputing they have a lot

00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,470
of genomics research that they wind up

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,100
working on it's very broad and stuff you

00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,930
kind of don't want them to screw up

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,390
let's contrast this Google's

00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:44,270
responsibilities as they see it is to

00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:47,000
organize the world's information sell

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,370
ads against the world's information and

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,430
of course turning things off that people

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,960
are actively using

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:57,880
good luck if you're using Google Cloud

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,880
I'm sure that story has a happy ending

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:06,590
this is why I don't get invited in nice

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:08,780
places the point being is that these are

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,130
different problems being solved by very

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,200
different people with very different

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,440
constraints but we're gonna go ahead and

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,940
give some jackwagon in the audience a

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,300
undue amount of credit simply because of

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:24,230
who he is where he works and okay

00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:27,290
great now what so what's the plan here I

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,120
mean how does that story end like you

00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,660
generally don't get to indulge in a

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,400
debate when someone asks a question and

00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,530
usually you don't just oh hang on great

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,840
let me edit my slides and change the

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:42,410
entire conclusion okay let me edit this

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:45,680
there we go it's a new talk yeah that's

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:49,910
my talk get your own it doesn't work

00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,440
that way and more to the point it's not

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,480
just about making the person on stage

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,400
feel I feel unfortunate because yes that

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,570
is just one person what about the effect

00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,840
that has on the rest of the audience

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,340
rather than a nuanced subtle

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,590
understanding of a story that had just

00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,890
been told about how a way to do things

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:10,100
instead they wound up lured yeah sorry

00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:12,770
yeah they wound up good lord I think

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,210
it's growing up something yeah instead

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,340
they talk about a big tech company does

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,350
things and oh well great now we're gonna

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,910
have another this is now how Google does

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,530
things and you should too story and

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,910
that's great but it doesn't work for

00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:27,290
most of us in a lot of environments

00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:29,300
because we're not Google the problem

00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,490
here is that people our businesses are

00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,260
not running giant search engines or

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:37,130
turning off things that people are using

00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:39,160
it comes down to a story of we all solve

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:42,020
different problems in different ways and

00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:46,610
oh let's be like Google is not the theme

00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:48,680
of every talk sorry Google the point is

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:52,490
is you don't work at these places for

00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:56,690
most of us and if you do be very very

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:58,310
careful about punching down the reason I

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:02,510
make fun of these companies on stage

00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:04,429
here is because you've won their mow

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,950
giant multinationals

00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:09,139
they are huge titans of industry they

00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:13,940
can take me getting on stage and making

00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:15,710
fun of them for 20 minutes recognize the

00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,899
weight that your words carry the rest of

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,850
us don't have these companies problems

00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:22,490
we don't have their constraints and we

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,230
sure don't have their resources so why

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,090
don't we stop trying to cargo cult their

00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,919
solutions into our environments based

00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,080
upon a little more than a fanciful story

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,309
I mean they do a lot of good work at

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,779
these companies please don't think that

00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:35,299
I'm trying to crap all over everything

00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:36,860
that they do and they build stuff that

00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:40,159
we all can leverage in our own

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,990
environments but without context that

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,480
work isn't going to magically solve our

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,279
pain so let's stop pretending that it

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,919
does I'm in case in point

00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,419
send me an army which is part of the

00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,330
suite of tools that includes chaos

00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:55,340
monkey is something that Netflix has

00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,869
talked about a lot for years in

00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,940
condescending talks just like this one

00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:02,990
and what it does is it randomly kills

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:04,340
AWS instances or entire regions to test

00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,259
their failover capability it's

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,850
identifying single points of failure you

00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:10,009
didn't know you had and coming up with

00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,649
ways to fix that that's great they're

00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:13,279
proud of it and they've heard about it

00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:16,490
for ages

00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:18,769
and we've all taken its lessons to heart

00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,230
to completely eliminate single points of

00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:23,570
failure in our own environment so when

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:27,830
an AWS region has an issue our sites

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:30,200
don't go down anymore yeah right one

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,999
service in one region goes down at the

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,639
beginning of this year and everything

00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:37,700
from Instagram to American Airlines to

00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:39,830
AWS a zone Status page shits itself the

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:45,110
death and yes

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:47,450
Netflix stayed up in 2016 Netflix's

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:51,529
annual technology and development budget

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,730
was 768 million dollars so yeah if you

00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:55,970
spend three-quarters of a billion

00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:59,629
dollars you can avoid a two hour outage

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:04,129
that takes down s3 the rest of us kind

00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:05,830
of weren't so lucky my point is that

00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:10,130
this is okay

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:12,110
most of the internet was down and I

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,580
talked to a number of admin types and

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:16,130
ops people who immediately wanted to

00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,200
dive in and restructure everything so

00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,450
that an out a regional outage of s3

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,140
would never again cause any downtime for

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:26,210
their site and okay interesting

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,730
I like the inclination but pause a

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:33,440
minute think about the business value of

00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:37,760
this we are connecting your entire stack

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,280
to be able to sustain a once every seven

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,690
years Black Swan style of event is going

00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,210
to potentially double or triple your

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,460
costs just an infrastructure let alone

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,050
the time it takes to build this does

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,910
that make sense for you if you're

00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,860
running something that is life critical

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,990
the people will die if it isn't up yeah

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,400
you probably should do it well yeah

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,990
those people dive we don't want to spend

00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,210
the infrastructure dollars is not a

00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:02,150
defensible position if you're running my

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:05,150
side project Twitter for pets maybe two

00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,710
hours of downtime is okay maybe when I'm

00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:11,480
down the Internet's a better place for

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:15,760
it yeah when it broke part of my

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,760
environment was down and that was okay

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,690
the point that I came here is not to

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:23,570
talk about your data centers your

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,400
environments I didn't come to talk about

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,350
your applications and their resiliency

00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,160
because honestly I could not possibly

00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:33,140
care less about any of those things I

00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,670
came here to talk about the dangers and

00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:39,610
the risks to you and us as people

00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:42,020
because it's hard to remember the human

00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,420
DevOps to me as a hen's has has always

00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,540
been about people so his technology as a

00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:49,970
whole it's about the humans we work with

00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,310
it's about the users we service it's not

00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,620
a just about the making the computers do

00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,320
the thing that's interesting and it's

00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,940
easy to lose sight of that you build

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,920
something you're proud of and then

00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,290
someone on stage gets up there or in the

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:06,560
audience gets up there and just craps

00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,720
all over it and you feel like crap and

00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,130
you really shouldn't because you built

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,680
something that works and solve problems

00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,780
that you have yes and a white ivory

00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,450
tower architecture whiteboard diagram

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,110
yeah oh there are some sways that look

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,820
suboptimal I can draw a better

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,140
there yeah but to make it work in the

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,880
real world you'll spend 20 billion

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,830
dollars it's not worth it for most of us

00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:31,559
you built a thing that works for you and

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:33,420
that's the point of it I would be

00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,010
shocked if the guy from the Department

00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,559
of Energy ever got up and gave that talk

00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:40,799
again after the Google bro shot all over

00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,840
him I want to believe that he did but as

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,330
a speaker it's hard to get up here and

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,700
give these talks and especially when

00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:49,260
you're new at it with the expectation

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,299
that maybe someone is going to just

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,750
eviscerate everything you've spent

00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:57,419
months working on and it's hard it's

00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,429
scary to do it and if my first speaking

00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:01,830
experience which frankly was terrible

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:03,270
because my talk was rubbish don't get up

00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:07,590
there and read man pages to people

00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:09,360
things you learn yeah it's very but

00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,190
people are very gracious and nice with

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,169
the you know that talk was great they

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,350
lied here's what you could do to make it

00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:18,840
better not that and yeah I had people

00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,850
give useful feedback kindly and my talks

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,260
steadily improved well I think they've

00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,750
improved some people after this thing

00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,580
would probably prefer a man page but if

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,169
you if so if people just get up there

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,030
and crap all over you and make you feel

00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,340
terrible about it why would you ever go

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:34,290
up and do it again

00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,120
so the takeaway that I would urge you to

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:39,900
per have here is when you see a great

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:42,270
talk about kubernetes or agnostic

00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,100
provisioning or I don't know serverless

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,340
or whatever thing we're trying to sell

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:52,890
you this week think about the context

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:55,350
behind the talk what are what is the

00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:58,440
speaker showing you what parts of the

00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:02,160
story are they leaving out there not you

00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,660
I had a conversation with a guy who gave

00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,280
that Netflix talk afterward like it's

00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,620
amazing all your developers have Rutten

00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,179
production how do you handle the credit

00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,380
card processing stuff that seems like a

00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:17,669
massive risk well not every developer is

00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,870
access to everything and ah yeah so you

00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,669
got up there and painted a better

00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,370
picture than things actually existed

00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:25,490
great contact we all do that it's fine

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:28,169
like we all get up here and talk about

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,870
yes we had this conversation where the

00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:32,220
open space is yesterday about the idea

00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,980
of pets versus cat alive

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:38,400
in open spaces event called pets vs.

00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,990
cattle prods and the yeah we all talk

00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,250
about the hidden pets in our

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,080
environments oh yeah

00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,450
we are completely infrastructure as code

00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,760
everything can be rebuilt with just the

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:52,409
press of a button except the Jenkins

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,780
server okay or oh yeah don't ask us

00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:56,850
about the database either everyone has

00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,190
these things that we don't talk about

00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,230
but no one gets up there and says this

00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,970
is our entire environment is completely

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,010
agnostic we can provision it anywhere

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,950
yeah except the part that makes us money

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,270
yeah don't ask us about that but that

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,990
old Google Reader infrastructure that

00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:14,400
was amazing yet don't don't do that and

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,470
on the other side of it when the speaker

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,360
is wrong gets up here and gives a talk

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,220
that sounds like complete great

00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,830
it missed the point it was a terrible

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,850
talk it couldn't ever work

00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:29,220
are you sure or is it just wrong for

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,409
your use cases and your environment and

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,030
maybe they see the world differently and

00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:37,350
of different problems that you have to

00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:41,039
tackle the point here is in either case

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,630
try and be the person that you wish the

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,640
other person was if the if the roles

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,470
were reversed if I see a terrible talk

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,970
and I want to say excuse me but isn't

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,860
everything you just told me horseshit

00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,630
it's like well how would I like that

00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:55,020
question it's like well I like it but

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:59,070
I'm weird so I probably shouldn't ask it

00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:02,490
like that and on the other side of it

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:04,169
when someone in the audience s asks a

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,020
question that doesn't make sense or just

00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:10,320
seems completely ambling it's Oh bless

00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:12,090
your heart yeah and if you see a speaker

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,830
of you're sweating bullets and nervous

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,470
giving a talk great throw them a

00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:18,510
softball question because frankly when

00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,820
you ask there any questions from the

00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,010
audience and there are no questions

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,340
you're standing here sweating bullets

00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:28,200
you want to die oh god no one understood

00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:32,730
what Isaac was this talk supposed to be

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,280
in English oh oh crap yeah the secret

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,690
here is that tech isn't about the tech

00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,390
it never has been it's been about the

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,919
people and if I could leave you with one

00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,390
thing the rest of the day whether you're

00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:46,020
a speaker or whether you're in the

00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:48,600
audience don't walk out of a talk

00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,010
shitty because what's the point of

00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,540
coming to a conference if I want to go

00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,800
somewhere and just feel bad about it

00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,730
I'll go talk to other people where I

00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,450
live it's depressing thank you very much

00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,980
for your time

00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,870
if anyone has any questions I am

00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,340
thrilled to answer them but I do remind

00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:07,170
you once again yeah

00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:10,260
okay go ahead what's your question sure

00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:12,090
I was born without will I born this

00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,560
awesome was the question no the answer

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,840
is I was born without the part of my

00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,140
brain that experiences shame and the

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,790
rest just sort of fluid flowed naturally

00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:24,480
other questions concerns criticisms a

00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:25,740
resume reading I told you so you asked

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,660
are there any questions you sit here

00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:31,670
dying sweating bullets yes great

00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,840
question

00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:35,040
something you don't question was is

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,300
alright if you're only telling half the

00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,710
story what's the best way to socialize

00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:41,460
some of the negative learnings that

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:43,530
you've had rolling this out I would

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,990
start by trying to pierce the myth of

00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:48,840
infallibility when you get up and you

00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:51,330
talk about how you wind up being able to

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,190
turn off entire regions of and things

00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,050
are in chaos monkey is amazing and we

00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:57,290
become much more resilient about this

00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:59,910
yeah talk about the darker side of that

00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:02,400
talk about how yeah the first three

00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:04,830
times we try that everything broke and

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,110
then we tried in a fourth time in almost

00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:09,960
everything broke and anything yeah by

00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:12,420
that our 800th test things kind of sort

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,790
of worked and their other dark sides of

00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,220
it to the context that gets lost for

00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:19,500
example the idea of chaos monkey of

00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,330
breaking things in production and seeing

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,130
how it works so you can fix it it's

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,400
great longer-term and it does lead to

00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:30,360
more resilient systems but you're

00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,190
testing on your paying customers now if

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,780
your Netflix and your streaming movies

00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,240
great because a failure mode in that

00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:39,540
context generally looks like Oh a stream

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,370
just broke okay hit play again must be

00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,950
my crappy internet connection thanks

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:46,370
Comcast or Atari thanks Bezeq yeah we're

00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,370
used to that

00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:51,730
but if you're doing this it's like

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,860
that's funny why didn't my payment go

00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,930
through yeah maybe that's not the sort

00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:59,740
of thing to start experimenting on when

00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:01,360
it's these things matter if it comes

00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,070
down to failure mode in heaps cases if

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,930
you're an ad display if you're an ad

00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,490
tech and displaying ads yeah because

00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,440
you're only people who you're really

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,180
hurting in that context is you you don't

00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,680
get to display as many ads and you lost

00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,200
a little bit of revenue when there was

00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:18,040
an outage great you can get away with

00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:20,740
that you can't justify that morally to

00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:23,830
some extent in some use cases so again

00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,180
maybe offering context around that in a

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,540
talk if you get up here to talk about

00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:30,700
chaos engineering caveat this of yeah by

00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,920
the way here's how we made sure for

00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,360
example that it didn't double bill

00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,700
people because you don't hear stories

00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,470
about that coming out because you might

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,190
need to be careful about the things that

00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,330
actually impact people in a real sense

00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:48,850
great question though thank you

00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:50,320
yes no no the question was why am I

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,330
dressed this way I have been referred to

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,420
as the Barney Stinson of DevOps before

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,100
but no this is only half of it you'll

00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:01,380
see the rest of it later during the

00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,380
Ignite talk it'll all make sense then oh

00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,550
good good yeah the question really came

00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:10,750
down to to dressing like this ever boost

00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:14,140
my credibility oh absolutely it yeah I

00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:16,000
mean realistic is a good question yeah

00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,220
just dressing what is dressing up yeah

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
good question but a lot topic not

00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:24,550
entirely so I started about 10 years ago

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,460
for fun for a week I wore a shirt and

00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:29,410
tie every day and my co-workers made fun

00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,360
of me like you wouldn't believe I'm

00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:33,460
working at a start-up and it's like huh

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,930
what are you here to sell us a mattress

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:40,510
yeah and with some startups that would

00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:42,010
have been yes but no the people made fun

00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:44,710
of me for it but at the same time they

00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:46,420
started taking me more seriously so a

00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:49,390
lot of things tie in to credibility

00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,610
being able to carry myself a certain way

00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,650
dressing a certain way that's not that's

00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,450
not so short the fact that I have a

00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:58,340
tremendous amount of credibility by

00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:01,490
being male white and straight that

00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,809
serious in that that I have a Fernandez

00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,400
amount of privilege and part of it is

00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:06,799
how I dress part of it is just inborn

00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,560
traits of Who I am and I'm very

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,000
cognizant of that and as far as does it

00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,030
open doors in a consulting sense

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,500
sometimes not every client responds well

00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,929
to this I'm independent I don't work for

00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,280
Accenture whose entire purpose is

00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:20,869
sending a bunch of very well-dressed

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,419
MBAs who will work themselves to death

00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:27,050
and then make the news months later for

00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:28,760
leaving on s3 bucket open and having all

00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,429
of the credentials for their clients and

00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,599
some of their emails leaked yeah

00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:34,520
swing-and-a-miss don't you charge like a

00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:36,649
king's ransom to tell people to not do

00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,450
explicitly that so yeah dressing well

00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:39,919
does add credibility but so does not

00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,649
 up the thing people probably

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,480
hate you to do so there's it helps but

00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:46,820
it's necessary to in some circles but

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,179
not sufficient great question I'd like

00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,270
that

00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:55,250
like other questions comments concerns

00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:57,080
Curtis is yes everything condescending

00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,790
comments come from people and regulated

00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:03,560
industries is your question well I used

00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:06,410
to work in one so yeah oh good question

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,780
yeah it's a yeah condescension is not

00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,410
something that is unique detect by a

00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,869
long shot

00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,580
the difference is in many respects is

00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:14,599
that tech is becoming aware of this and

00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,790
that's the part of the DevOps movement

00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,640
is is about empathy and reaching out to

00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,260
human beings and you're having

00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,890
conversations with people you don't see

00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:26,300
at yeah you know finance conference or a

00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,339
law conference

00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,570
oh they're condescending there and they

00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:31,520
have no problem with it

00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:35,690
hahaha let me show you pictures of my

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,010
boat yeah yeah they're condescending but

00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,410
they don't generally have the same

00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,330
cultural awareness weed that this tech

00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,890
environment tends to great question

00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,990
