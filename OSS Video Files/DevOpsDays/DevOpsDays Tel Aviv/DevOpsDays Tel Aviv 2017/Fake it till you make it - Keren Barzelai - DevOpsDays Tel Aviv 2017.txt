so hi my name is Karen and I'm gonna

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:18,779
talk about faking it thank you thank you

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,869
I need it I've often found myself

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,420
starting jobs where I had to learn a

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,630
bunch of new stuff but also perform at

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,849
the same time and I find that faking it

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,669
is a great tool to help me get started

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:36,780
but faking it is often perceived as a

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:39,239
bad thing and I think it's actually an

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,129
integral part of learning so what I want

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,660
to do today is suggest three tips on

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,879
things that you can do to help you learn

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:52,170
better but also look like you know what

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:53,940
you're doing so first up start with

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,860
vocabulary it's the easiest thing to

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,480
learn or fake and it gives you common

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:03,120
grounds with people who are actually in

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,309
the know second one silence silence is

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:11,310
your friend so be sure to talk less and

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:13,140
listen more and last one questions we

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,520
are often afraid to ask questions

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,920
because we think it will make us look

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,810
dumb but actually if you think about it

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,689
in order to ask questions questions

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,610
indicate that you know something and

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:27,500
that you're willing to learn so

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,150
questions actually make you seem smarter

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,880
so these were my first that these are

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,590
the first steps that can help you learn

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,070
and look like you know what you're doing

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,600
obviously there are a lot more things

00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,009
these are all from slides that didn't

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,340
make the cut because I don't have much

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:48,240
time today so but I want to end this

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,399
talk with a don't so just be sure to not

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,079
get cut up caught up and faking it

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,549
because faking it can help you hit the

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,460
ground running but it will only get you

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,110
so far so make sure to focus on what you

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,840
already know and what you still need to

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,740
learn and you will look like a pro no

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,620
time thank you

00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,620
