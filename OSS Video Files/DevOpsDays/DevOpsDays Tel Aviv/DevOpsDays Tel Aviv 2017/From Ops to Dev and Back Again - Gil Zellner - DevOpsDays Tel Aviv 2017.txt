from ops to Devon back again I'm yo

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,610
that's my Twitter handle and the QR code

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,199
is also for tweeting at me so disagree

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,170
with everything that I say on Twitter

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,170
that's what Twitter is for from off to

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,480
Devon back again is to play on words for

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,160
the Hobbit if any of you have read that

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,160
I was too lazy I just saw the movie

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:35,070
which sucked that's who I am I work for

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,450
crosswise at Oracle data cloud could

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,530
talk about that later I work for a whole

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,170
bunch of other companies and past

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:45,469
another place is I'm sorry yeah it's

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,010
from the past so I guess it's legacy

00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:53,940
it's exactly and a while ago I saw this

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,129
on Hacker News so software developers

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,850
should have sysadmin experience which is

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,140
like the biggest flame war of our time

00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:05,580
of course it's like the totally low

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:08,610
subject and I thought like you know I

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:13,290
kind of you know quick question how many

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:16,490
of you are deaf guys who do ops how many

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:20,909
of you are ops guys who develop tools

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:24,420
interesting partition so there is a

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,740
distinction so I'd like to focus on this

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,369
transition that I made these are the

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:32,880
past three places I worked at I was an

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:35,270
obstinate get and my main achievement

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,680
was an automatic deployment system which

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,180
you know shortened deployment times and

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,770
everything much more simpler and yada

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,979
yada yada you heard about enough about

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,210
those type of things and its main

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,060
features were application lifecycle

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,399
management illustration and monitoring

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,090
which are all features of a project so

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,409
I'll clarify so when I got the

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,119
opportunity to join the team to clarify

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,649
and work on a product that you know

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,420
already did some of the stuff that

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,369
already did I was like who can do so but

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,289
but that but then I know working morning

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:12,930
fans really okay anyway so but then you

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,470
know when I joined I realized that what

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,660
I was build

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,360
was screwed what I built before was a

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,070
script and it kind of like hacked

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,810
together how much you stopped it would

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,460
you what clarify was it was a product

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,850
which is completely different mindset

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:29,040
and when you develop stuff with this

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,350
kind of for your ops team it's usually

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,030
counting a stack overflow alongside duct

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:37,830
tape and but when you make a product it

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,330
has all these JIRA items and you know

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,230
project managers and all kind of stuff

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,790
like that also when you uh when you work

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,110
on these type of things and part your

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,990
ops team kind of macgyvering things

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:52,140
together on your own but when you work

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,580
as the product team you have a team and

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,260
how these bunch of people that you have

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,810
to work together and help kinda have to

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,610
learn how to do that and you kind of end

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,420
up feeling like a junior again in many

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,070
ways but what I did bring to clarifying

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,720
why I went there was this kind of

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,730
realization today like passed over to

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,430
the other side and I made tools for

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,810
people that were like me so I think that

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,160
was like great learnings because I and I

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,560
hope that I contributed to some extent

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,080
to what I'm out there also I came in

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,970
much more independent many devs don't

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,459
know how to do certain things like your

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,050
own said earlier so I did have some of

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,580
those so that was a good thing that you

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,280
know an ops person coming to dev brings

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,340
alongside now that I can focus to the

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,530
next step that I made I thought if I I

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,000
joined the team with crosswise you know

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,980
I'm back to being that you know Swiss

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,350
Army knife of computing stuff again and

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,060
you know now we can hack stuff together

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,230
again you know it's cool you can kludge

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,720
again because you know it's only for us

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,310
and you know and the coolest thing is

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,750
that you know because I was a dev now I

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:53,730
know kung-fu or rather Python so which

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,019
means that which is not just you know

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,230
it's just Python this whole bunch of

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:01,019
other development centric tools and you

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,700
know I can dive in to code much better

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,410
and knowing what it does and also I

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,519
speak dev so I communicate way better

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:10,260
with other people so to answer this

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,790
question of should the software

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,140
developers have sysadmin experience

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,370
that's a definite yes

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:19,590
to my to my opinion but since admins you

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,109
also get developer experience and I'll

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,840
get and I'll go one step further there's

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,039
anybody here seen Slumdog Millionaire

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,600
so here's the thing for those of you who

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:28,740
haven't it's basically about a guy

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,970
and his life experience and how they

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,010
contribute to a certain point in his

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,510
life where it gets them it gets him

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,270
exactly what he wants I won't like try

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,920
to spoil too much of the movie and the

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,280
thing is that every role you take on the

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,690
way gives you something because I did

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,850
support I know how to talk to clients

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,080
because I worked in IT I know how what

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,310
hardware looks like which is apparently

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,290
rare these days and I think that you

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,120
should try to be as diverse in terms of

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,110
the roles that you do as much as you can

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,610
as long as it doesn't hurt your career

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:02,160
too much and well that's about it keep

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:05,670
in touch that's me tweet at me again

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,550
that's what the QR codes for and that's

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:12,269
about it thank you

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,269
