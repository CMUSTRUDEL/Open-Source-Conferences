the orchestration of all of them okay he

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,720
what what toranshah does taking your

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,250
kubernetes introduction and have a

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:47,250
bird's view from from the bird's view he

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,310
can see everything inside he can he can

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,680
auto scale more kubernetes hosts we will

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,740
see that happened and it has four

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,899
component component for rancher he has

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,930
infrastructure orchestration which we

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,329
can spin up more hosts for the for the

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,649
kubernetes or for the messes or for the

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,290
swamp okay

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,780
he has container orchestration

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,260
scheduling and he has application

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,840
catalog because his application where

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,060
of your containers okay and the

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,430
identified control from security

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,250
measures and stuff like that

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:26,140
Roger architecture okay how it works so

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:29,120
you can connect to your Active Directory

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,980
organization held up in whatever for the

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,650
user management he have ops management

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,180
he can extend himself for other tools

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:42,859
you know see itÃ­s like Jenkins and

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:46,060
terraform formation and unseeable

00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:49,549
whatever okay he can extend them of that

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:53,480
he supports a lot of apps in his catalog

00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:56,209
that you can spin up and launch in one

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,060
click okay

00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:03,500
watcher can manage containers you have

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:06,590
its own cattle that you can use but you

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,409
don't have to okay you can look at the

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,620
containers that he can see from above

00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:19,699
okay here we see in the example Rancher

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:21,799
host you can add more hosts okay you can

00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:26,000
monitor containers and see if they are

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:29,530
running if there are alive or not and it

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,970
can monitor the uses and the memories

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:37,280
watcher is free by the way it's an open

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:40,040
source project okay varchar2 is very

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,829
very unique very very new ok

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,910
a lot of companies may be still using

00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:49,540
the old ranchers Rancher to the new UI

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:52,220
ok a very different things that they did

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,609
differently now when they used to do it

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,699
before our tell of the tape what will

00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:01,340
seem today in in the last minutes that I

00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:04,609
have is how it runs how it can

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,659
orchestrate stuff and so this is the

00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:10,729
command that we can run a rancher server

00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:12,500
inside of a container it always runs

00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:18,310
inside of a container on a dock your

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:21,079
hosts it this is the Rancher to UI and

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,180
we can write we can launch Rancher in

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,030
the bigger environment with an active

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,250
active high availability environment

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,680
okay so we have the longship always

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,940
available to us even when the container

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:38,630
is down we also need database of course

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:41,930
for that we can add Rancher agent to a

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:44,150
host okay if we already have hosts we

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,690
have computed resource in our growing

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,940
organization or mesos we can add agent

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:53,540
that we speak with the rancher server

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:57,310
that you installed we can add ec2 hosts

00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:00,770
and provision them like with one click

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:04,640
we can add more environments like QA and

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:07,700
dev and testing and staging unit under

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,380
testing whatever ok you can contain

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,190
government whatever you like is just a

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,260
label that isolate we can have

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:18,979
environment templates I can have in my

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:22,430
organization one a 1 1 child 2 will also

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:24,590
kubernetes also mix up messes and also

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,500
swamp I can have swung from my dev

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:30,290
environment I can have kubernetes for my

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,680
QA and testing and I can have in

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:36,560
production vessels for the big data ok

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,740
and one Rancher to hold them all we are

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,740
done here

00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,660
