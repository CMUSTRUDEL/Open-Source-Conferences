I actually wanted to talk about

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
something serious this time surprising

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,540
it for me so open source project I

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,460
recently stumbled upon this Twitter

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,109
thread and by the way I'm totally

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,480
winging this I didn't practice it just

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,890
coming from the heart so bear with me I

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,080
recently stumbled upon this Twitter

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,609
thread and it got me thinking about the

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,340
people standing behind open-source

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,529
projects these people that give from

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,420
their time and you know their personal

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,750
lives to they're nothing short of angels

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,340
to maintain these projects and

00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,850
oftentimes they run into a lot of snark

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,170
and you know a lot of disparaging and

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,340
it's really demotivating and we actually

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,570
have to think about the people standing

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,550
behind these projects and what they're

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:55,170
giving us the large part about all the

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:58,500
services that we that we use are powered

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,850
by open source code and you know you

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,409
don't have to look much further than the

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,960
NPM left pad disaster to realize how

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,159
fragile it is and you should be very

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,720
afraid I started opening up this

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,979
Pandora's box and I went down this

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,710
rabbit hole and it's there's a lot of

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,549
there's a lot of pain there with the

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,759
people that are maintaining these

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,890
projects I actually want to read an

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,330
excerpt I mean a lot of I mean plenty

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,619
has been said about you know maintaining

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,360
open source projects I'm not going to

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,860
not the person I don't maintain a

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,780
project I'm not really the person who

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,250
can talk about it in depth but I

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,509
recently stumbled upon a really good

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,640
blog post and I actually want to read an

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,229
excerpt from it but I really do think

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,549
that all of you should read this article

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,340
called roads and bridges the unseen

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,810
labor behind our digital infrastructure

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,430
I'll just say just as an aside you know

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,350
some of the maintainer of the Python

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,640
community

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,229
Justino labret cannon have been very

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,720
vocal about you know their burnout and

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:56,009
other things definitely recommended to

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,320
to read to read this so a day in the

00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,549
life of an open-source maintainer

00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,740
outside your door stands a line of a few

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,759
hundred people there patiently waiting

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,259
for you to answer their questions

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,360
complaints pull requests and feature

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,429
requests you want to help all of them

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,629
but for now you're putting it off maybe

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,099
you had a hard day at work or you're

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,870
tired or you're just trying to enjoy a

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,430
weekend with your family and friends

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,110
if you go to github.com / notifications

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,480
there's a constant reminder of how many

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,739
people are waiting when you manage to

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,000
find some spare time you open the door

00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,680
to the first person they're well-meaning

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,780
enough they tried to use your project

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,340
ran into a confusion over the API

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,900
they've pasted their code into a github

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,610
comment but they forgot or didn't know

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,269
how to format it through code is a big

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,650
unreadable mess da we really glanced at

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,390
the hundred of other folks waiting in

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,409
line behind them you could spend a half

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,269
an hour trying to understand this

00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,349
person's code or he could just skim

00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:42,450
through it and offer some links to

00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:43,950
tutorials and documentation and

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,190
off-chance it'll help to solve their

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,540
problem dot dot the next person line has

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,670
a frown on their face they spew out

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,290
complaints about how your project wasted

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,790
two hours of their time and their life

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,859
because a certain API didn't work as

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,849
advertised their vitriol gives you a bad

00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:00,780
feeling in the pit of your stomach so

00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,010
that's what it's like to be an

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,230
open-source maintainer it's pretty

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,790
thankless there's a lot of burnout

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,530
involved these are people there's our

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,140
real humans behind these projects and

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,760
they're not often thanked nearly enough

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,170
but this is what it's also like to be an

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,909
open-source project this is a typical

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,680
landscape you're there in the middle

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:18,239
actually you're not on the outskirts

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,220
that's you out

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,450
okay so aside from trying to you know

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,150
stay relevant have a really awesome

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,950
project yeah roll out awesome features

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,540
you still you have the other open-source

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,010
projects that might be out innovating

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,379
you you have the incumbents that are

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,090
still still trying to determine relevant

00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,919
you have the Giants that as soon as you

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,190
become successful don't want to take a

00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,480
bite out of your face and this is what

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,370
it looks like when you start to you know

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,590
gain some stability and maturity

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,299
monetize you're suddenly perceived as

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,560
uncool what an uncool project and there

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,269
are no free lunches there no free lunch

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,730
is a lot of these open-source projects

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,370
they shut down rethink DB others data

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,139
center recently or they have to you know

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,739
regroup to see how they keep on keeping

00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,720
on to see how they managed to maintain

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,699
really good stellar code because really

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,260
good code doesn't maintain itself and I

00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,340
just give a shout out here it Susilo DB

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,599
because they do really excellent

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,760
open-source work but we shouldn't take

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,040
things for granted like really good open

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,139
source projects like this there's a lot

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,650
of you know manpower that goes into it

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,909
and closed source all right I want to

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,250
you know this is a real misconception

00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:24,780
it's not a silver bullet just because

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,069
it's closed and you can't see the bugs

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,870
inside doesn't mean there

00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:30,190
open-source doesn't have more bugs

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,020
they're just fully transparent fall to

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,009
see I like that Jonathan Bryce recently

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,000
said that it wanted the OpenStack

00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:38,069
summits so I want to challenge our

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,280
definition of cool

00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:43,539
what makes an open source project cool I

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,050
think that making the impossible

00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:49,630
possible that's really damn cool CERN

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,270
nuclear research scientists doing the

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,030
craziest stuff 8,000 servers more than

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,130
280,000 cores 3,000 3,000 VMs all in

00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,750
OpenStack OpenStack not normally

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,440
considered cool I think that's pretty

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,000
damn cool maintaining my developer mind

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,550
share for an extended period of time

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,340
engagement over the years that's really

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,259
not an easy feat a lot of project they

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,240
fizzle out they die they can't maintain

00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:17,560
the momentum it's really important

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,940
trusted by the biggest and baddest a lot

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,919
of these companies are using my sequel

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:25,810
Facebook really mochel about it Wix as

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:28,150
well OpenStack canonical Tesla a lot of

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,979
a you know good open source projects

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,270
Linux probably powering the ninety

00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:35,860
percent of them get docker and I think

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,120
enabling a marketplace of profitability

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,580
and this is where it becomes really

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,229
uncool it's a really an important thing

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,050
because if there are companies that can

00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:45,759
monetize on open source projects and by

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,620
monetizing they're able to put developer

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,479
resources onto these projects so that

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,130
they can be maintained for the long term

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,199
that's really important you want these

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,930
projects to be sustained and maintained

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,000
and be able to survive in the long run

00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,349
so if you can omit enable if it's the

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,819
win-win situation if you can enable a

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:02,860
market place of profitability for those

00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:05,490
who will take these open-source projects

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,020
build on them provide stability

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,690
enterprise-grade support additional

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,190
features it's really important just one

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,750
more thing that isn't really on topic

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,460
but it's something that I think also

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,900
needs saying there are more ways to get

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,030
involved in open-source than just

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,889
contributing code you can contribute to

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,599
documentation editing answering

00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,270
questions on Stack Overflow just be an

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,949
evangelist be a human be a human about

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,419
open-source projects there are a lot of

00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:30,639
really good people standing behind them

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:32,979
and while Sebastian might laugh at me

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,070
stars on github also important maybe

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:37,330
it's not a metric of like how successful

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,889
the project is or how many Forks or

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,950
whatever it is but it helps maintain

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,740
motive

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:45,680
so I think it's really important and I

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,750
think the writer of crl is really damn

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,950
awesome Daniel Steinberg let's give a

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,620
big high five

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,450
nobody would associate the URL with

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,990
being the coolest and baddest but you

00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:59,090
know what

00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:01,190
you're awesome to me so open source some

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,780
suggested reading these are really good

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,010
articles that I stumbled upon in writing

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:11,690
this and clarify that Co we're hiring

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,690
