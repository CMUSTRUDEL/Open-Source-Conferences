Description: 
	structured data, dynamic data, big data, data driven….. we hear about data all the time. But what is “data” exactly? The term is frequently used, yet is rarely defined or thought of - and it turns out the answer to “what is data” is not simple at all. “Data” is a software concept which describes real world properties and information - and there must exist some process of creating “data” from those properties. This “data modeling” process is one of the most fundamental and complex exercises in software engineering but it’s often overlooked and taken for granted. In addition, once you have data it must be actively maintained. Corrupted is relatively easy to detect, but how do you know if you are missing data? This talk aims to review what “data” is, how it is created, defined and maintained show real world examples of the complexities, problems and solutions of these often ignored processes.

[Music]

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,360
welcome to data you keep using that word

00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:14,130
which is another one of the talks about

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,639
stuff that seems obvious but really

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,650
isn't

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,390
I'm part of the Wits engineering team

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,609
which is quite awesome and we're always

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,240
hiring and stuff so yeah you know where

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,010
to find us

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,480
I'm not going to talk about wigs because

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,289
let's face it it's boring and you all

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,900
know it anyway

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,119
and so let's just go right into it and

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:35,309
by the way I'm Nukem big on Twitter if

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:38,730
anybody wants to twit and yes and

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:42,450
 so let's start by defining data

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,190
what the hell is data well for something

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,070
that people use all the time you know

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,770
big data tale oriented and all that

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,199
stuff that you hear about it's quite

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,170
bizarre but no one here can tell me what

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,440
data is don't you think so

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,910
maybe you should talk about what data is

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,250
so I have my own definition of what data

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,670
is and I'm specifically not saying it's

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,560
my definition so we don't you know start

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,640
arguing about this because I'm right of

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,770
course data is a representation of

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,979
information in a computable storable

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,689
form okay mainly the digital form okay

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,450
and this is important and this is

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,729
important because this means that it has

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,470
some limitations we can't store in

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,000
digital form anything that we want we

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,140
can't store infinite stuff for example

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,900
so data has to have some finite length

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,850
finite size and it has to be discrete

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,549
because this is the way the digital

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,229
formats work this means that we have to

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,689
make decisions about resolution for

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,640
example we can't store you know very

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,409
fine-grained resolution just takes up

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,180
too much space

00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:50,520
also it's bounded okay for example

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,930
integer has an upper bound and so on so

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,329
on so on but the most important thing is

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,920
the data is structured okay so probably

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,899
all of you have heard of unstructured

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,759
data there is no such thing as

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,340
unstructured data not by my definition

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,049
anyway okay what we call unstructured

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,420
data usually means that we have multiple

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,190
structures or maybe we don't know the

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,560
structure so well and so on so on so on

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,480
but data is always structured in

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,290
why because computers can only work with

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,000
structured stuff and this is why and of

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,740
course it has to have an own format

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,270
otherwise you can't use it data is a

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,040
snapshot of information when you

00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,890
captured data from the world from the

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,410
real world you take it this instant in

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:38,160
time and the world keeps living on keeps

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,110
changing and the data that's frozen that

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,380
doesn't keep you know evolving as time

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,900
goes by so it's basically a snapshot

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,310
that lives on its own now but now that

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,260
we know where data is the question is

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,590
how does data be coming from how does

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,570
information become data there has to be

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,970
some process of converting information

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,850
into the into data and what is that

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,860
process data modelling that is a process

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,290
and this is a process where we take

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,700
information and we full set into some

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,560
digital form like so this is a process

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,630
that is you know we do it all the time

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,690
but we often ignore it most people are

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,640
not even aware they're doing it so it's

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,440
it's really worth taking a look at this

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,630
because when you make mistakes in data

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,000
modeling those are bugs that are almost

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,150
impossible to fix there's really no way

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,370
to recover that data is there so

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,050
probably we should talk about this data

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,820
modeling is the process of defining how

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,400
to extract data from real world

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,820
information and it has a number of

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,050
thoughts and so on so on so on but what

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,450
we need to understand about data

00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,120
modeling is the data modeling is lossy

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,090
there is always some information that we

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,610
lose in the conversion okay why is it

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,080
lossy first of all because we have to

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,880
make decisions about what we don't

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,860
collect we cannot collect all the

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,660
information we don't have enough space

00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,310
there's infinite information in the

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,050
world and we cannot collect all of it so

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,180
we decide upfront what we want what we

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,610
don't want some of that stuff we will

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,860
never collect sound that stuff we might

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,330
find after the fact that we need but you

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,549
didn't collect it so now we're kind of

00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,610
screwed up but that's not the only

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:16,200
problem it's also lossy because we have

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,260
limited accuracy remember the solution

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,590
bounds and that kind of stuff so the

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,270
conversion itself is lossy it's not only

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,230
the decision to be made about what to

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,900
collect it's also the conversion itself

00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,340
and of course with this context all the

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,010
information all the stuff that we have

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,920
in the world comes in context and when

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,260
we extract data we lose that context and

00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,420
that means that the data that we took

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:44,200
has now a slightly different meaning

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:47,320
from a detail in a real world their

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,540
models are always biased okay it's a

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,790
selection bias basically because we've

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,570
selected the subset of information that

00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:58,390
subset has a bias often this bias is not

00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,430
a bias that we ended up front we kind of

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,620
look a no it really but it's a bias that

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,330
exists nevertheless there is some reason

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,970
why you collected this data and not this

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:10,210
data usually it's because it's easier

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,400
and that's a fundamental bias that that

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,440
can hurt us really bad but the

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,510
conversion itself again it's also biased

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,720
and I will give an example of this so

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,810
formats okay there's an assumption that

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,840
the format in which you store the data

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,580
doesn't impact the data that you have

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,820
right that's kind of an implicit

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,440
assumption this assumption is incorrect

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,970
formats have a huge impact on the data

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,390
that you collect and on the type of

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,910
conversion that you use okay one of the

00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:44,290
very frequent examples that people see

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:46,870
is JPEG and PNG for example PNG is a an

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,180
image format that can be used for text

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,550
and JPEG picture format that cannot be

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,990
used for text and why because JPEG the

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,270
compression algorithm that we use in

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,000
JPEG doesn't work very well on sharp

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:01,210
edges okay so if you try and scan

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,390
something text and save it as JPEG you

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,390
would have these artifacts you would

00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,340
have dots around the stuff you will lose

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,350
the edges of the fonts would look bad

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,450
the fonts itself will be bad in some

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,180
cases will be unreadable you have lost

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,880
information in the conversion okay but a

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,470
lot of people are not aware of this and

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:24,490
you'd be amazed how many all see all

00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,950
programs have as a default format jpg

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,410
which is horrible

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:31,510
Jeff is awesome for pictures for scenery

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,890
for that kind of stuff but if you think

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,490
about this even when you take a picture

00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:37,810
you have some bias and some loss because

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,730
you have to have focus

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,940
camels have focused and if you focus on

00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,530
the

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,390
person you lose the background if you

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,680
focus on the background you didn't

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,410
accuracy on the person that you're

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,570
taking the picture of okay so you have

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,820
all those phenomenas all the time but if

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,070
that's not bad enough the rest of the

00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,480
conversion process also have problems so

00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,450
let me tell you a story

00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,580
this is a story about the Xerox photo

00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:05,320
copiers specifically the world's walk

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:07,120
center model and this QR code here is a

00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,110
link to the original blog post of the

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,850
guy founders and basically when you take

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,250
a picture in photo copier when you copy

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:19,530
a document you expect the copy to be

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:21,970
well a copy right well you'd be amazed

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:25,660
this is what actually happens you take a

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:28,660
picture and some numbers and some

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,480
letters are being replaced there nothing

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,650
smudged though not being distorted

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:37,600
they're being replaced okay you can see

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,770
here that the eight here was originally

00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:44,280
fixed and here and here

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,690
this happened in legal documents on

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,280
architecture plans and so on so on so on

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,500
and what do people do with the original

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,960
well the copiers of course you know a

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,000
copies of if you wait the original now

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,150
there's no way to recover from this this

00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,790
has been in the field for eight years

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:03,220
eight years imagine the amount of data

00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,770
that we've lost and what this happen

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,030
this happened because well a photocopier

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,120
is basically a scanner and printer

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:13,480
attached and they scanned and is saved

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,000
in in a picture format that had pattern

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,270
matching to save space and it matched

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,250
patterns very well as you can see they

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,530
didn't use lossless compression which

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,350
they should have so yes

00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,790
formats do matter and you need to think

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,500
about the intent of how you're going to

00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,580
use that data when you extract that data

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,710
because it has a real impact

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:39,430
so let's as an exercise try to model the

00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,500
person okay and let's see if we can find

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:44,470
all the problems that may arise in this

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,589
modelling so let's talk about names

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,330
every person has a name yes you don't

00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,460
know the reference to this of course

00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,890
they have a first name and last name

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,310
sometimes they have a middle name maybe

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:58,840
but how long should name be I mean we

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,210
have to have some limited database for

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:06,580
it should be 10 characters should eat 20

00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:08,440
characters enough what sorry not enough

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,940
let's give an example so this is the

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:18,520
longest name in Africa I hope you can

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:19,690
hear this this is the name I don't know

00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,050
if you can hear this but look this up

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,330
online

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,100
hilarious and you can see the first

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,990
station on that person's face when he

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,720
keeps repeating the name and the guy

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,430
doesn't get it very very annoying this

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:36,610
is actually not the longest name the

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:40,330
world this is senior yes but does anyone

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:42,340
know picasso's full name so picasso's

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,600
full name is Pablo Diego Jose Francisco

00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:49,030
deaf world

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:52,000
Paola joo-won laputan new moon channel

00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:55,360
Maria de Los Remedios Cipriano della

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,700
Santina Santissima Trinidad we eat the a

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,160
Picasso that's because his full name

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,640
yes ten characters is definitely not

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,890
enough of course some people don't have

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,750
middle names some people have middle

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,640
names some people don't have last names

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,750
not all cultures have lost names for

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:17,500
example and of course in some kind of

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:20,020
cultures it's not real if the family

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,800
name is first and last is Kim jong-il

00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:26,980
mr. Kim Oh miss Toni anybody wants to

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,590
take a guess mr. Kim that's correct

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,720
he's mr. Kim is that mr. Ahn in Korean

00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,030
cultures and many other Eastern East

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,180
Asian cultures and the family name comes

00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:39,070
first so you can imagine what happens on

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,960
forms and and how the data gets stored

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:44,890
in that conversion that doesn't work

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:47,260
very well does it names are hard does a

00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,970
lot of cultural differences and they can

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,340
change people don't take this into

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,140
account you can change your name we have

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,750
legal names and we have names that

00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,220
people go by not often not always people

00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,780
have one name sometimes they use

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,280
different names the Chinese for example

00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,870
have a Western name and they have a

00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,310
Chinese name because the Westerners

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,540
can't deal with the Chinese

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:09,250
obviously some names or not unicode but

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,810
I thought that the ascii was not enough

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,270
turns out that even unicode is not

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,790
enough for four names by the way the QR

00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,590
code again gets you to a very very

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,630
interesting article about all the

00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,430
falsehoods that programmers believe

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,040
about names um

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,540
minimum length and maximum length so my

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,580
friend also here tells me that he has a

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,380
lot of problems in the US because

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,070
apparently the Americans think that

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:35,710
names with two characters don't exist

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:38,680
yeah that stuff so lots and lots and

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:42,100
lots of problems H must be so much

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,020
easier right but age changes every year

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,779
and if you're a good person and then

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,690
doesn't change anymore okay what about

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:51,700
the meaning of maximum age so turns out

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,560
that in Korea when you're born your

00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,870
basic they start counting from the

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,670
moment of Inception so when you're born

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,610
three three months left you were born in

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,500
one year old whereas in the rest of the

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:07,839
world it's like zero and in China it's

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:10,900
one immediately okay what happens if you

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:15,390
were born on December 31st midnight and

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:19,089
then time zone changes what's your age

00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:20,740
well 20 you're one year older and why is

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,140
age an integer

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:29,500
why isn't it float we've made a decision

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:31,900
about resolution but like why okay okay

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,400
the result of all this is that people

00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:38,260
have willed bugs an example is that a

00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,940
114 year old woman tried to register on

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,589
Facebook and had to lie about her age

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,520
because apparently Facebook don't

00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:47,020
believe that people over 100 exist what

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,390
would ever registered Facebook yeah they

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,560
fix this sense but yet they had this

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:55,470
problem look this link up it's hilarious

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,709
yeah so many problems

00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:01,480
what about gender so if you're talking

00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,100
about physiological gender then for

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,550
genders exist you either have male

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:10,510
genitalia yeah female genitalia both or

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:12,459
neither okay so for genders definitely

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,440
not binary what about social gender

00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,329
you're talking about maybe 26 or

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,129
something like

00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:19,079
but if you're talking about legal gender

00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,639
then you only have to in Israel because

00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:24,389
the government doesn't believe

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,249
Physiology or something how reality in

00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:29,849
general but let's not go there

00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:32,279
um I know it's definitely not binary so

00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:34,199
it really depends what what is the

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,679
purpose when you're talking about

00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:39,659
general gentle what about the addresses

00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,429
like we've made the addresses up right

00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:45,359
there's no reason they should be

00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:47,849
complicated does everyone have an

00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:49,499
address I was a nomad for almost a year

00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:51,179
for example I didn't have an address I

00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:52,829
had to put an address on some phones

00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:55,319
because like the government doesn't

00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:56,909
believe that people like me exist but I

00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:59,519
didn't actually have an address

00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:01,859
what about zip codes so whenever we

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,529
changed the zip code from five digits in

00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:06,569
digits to seven digits and that created

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:08,339
the whole lots of problems from many old

00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:11,989
systems but it turns out that in some

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:15,809
countries the digit in the zip code is

00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:18,179
alphanumeric not numeric okay Milty or

00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:19,889
military addresses is a good example in

00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,809
here in Israel also we have other

00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:25,789
problems with the code some buildings

00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:28,379
have two zip codes some have none

00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:30,269
addresses can change maybe because I

00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:32,639
moved an apartment or maybe because the

00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:35,129
city decided to change the name of the

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,649
street they do that apparently oh maybe

00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:41,399
the country changed its name that also

00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:44,969
happens right so very very very quickly

00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:47,969
by the way I found out that you can have

00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:51,929
a building with a negative number yeah

00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:53,609
that exists I don't know what about

00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:55,949
countries so when you're talking about

00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:58,949
country depends when so think about

00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:00,809
former Yugoslavia for example I don't

00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:02,639
get me talking about Yugoslavia like

00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:04,229
everything else there is messed up but

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,449
like Joe Slovak I used to be one country

00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:08,999
now it's two countries and one of them

00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:10,949
changing its name like it used to be

00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:13,979
like the Czech Republic now it's just I

00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:15,869
don't know check or something so little

00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:18,449
really weird so it depends when it the

00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:20,219
when but also who you're asking because

00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:22,859
you talk about Taiwan for example the

00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:25,979
Chinese will tell you it's China the

00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:27,240
Americans will not agree and you can go

00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:31,680
on

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:34,200
it's really really problematic but about

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,970
identity a person has an identity how do

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,680
you distinguish between two people that

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:43,950
live on the same street and have the

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:45,480
same name that's a problem fortunately

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,800
in Israel we have an ID number

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,630
what about countries that don't have

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,370
government-issued ID number so maybe

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,560
they just don't want to give you their

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,930
ID number and you can force them can you

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,140
unless you're the government and you

00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:01,860
don't care yeah that's hard

00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,140
let's talk about dates dates are

00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,670
insanely hard insanely hard first of all

00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,380
we have multiple calendars we have the

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,940
civil calendar we have the Gregorian

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,550
calendar which is just like the civil

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,320
calendar but it's not it's different and

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,630
then we have the Jewish calendar which

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,149
is moon based but we adjust it to the

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,709
solar calendar and then we have the

00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,839
Muslim calendar which is totally moon

00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:23,310
based so it's kind of you know moves

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,040
around all the time it's really weird

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,930
but then we have like the Chinese

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,529
calendar and so on so and so on really

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,850
weird calendars all over the place

00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:35,010
really really hard to work with dates

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,690
even if you're working only with the

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,420
civil debt you have to deal with stuff

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:43,140
like time zones and time zones a whole

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,940
bowl bell whole bow they start and end

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,790
on different dates every year on

00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,200
different countries okay and sometimes

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,089
the government announces it like two

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,089
weeks before or even no not even that

00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:55,410
and the zones themselves change you know

00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:57,959
some countries just move themselves

00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,310
between certain time zones sometimes you

00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,470
have in the same country different zones

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,910
sometimes the country I don't know if

00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,550
you know this but you have zones that

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:09,600
are like on the half hour an hour or not

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:11,850
the full hour really weird that they can

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,459
geographically overlap you can have the

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:16,920
same time zone in the same place as two

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,990
different time zones in the same place

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,709
an example of this would be East

00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,170
Jerusalem

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,670
the Palestinians have their own time

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,209
zone and we have our own time zone in

00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:29,340
the same place I don't know how it even

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,350
works and of course some dates don't

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,179
exist because you know you skip an hour

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,830
and then this hour doesn't exist

00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,480
but then you have an hour that exists

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:40,419
twice

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,090
okay that sounds fun you might want to

00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:45,340
check this yeah look it up on YouTube

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,370
computer five time zones five minute

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:52,240
video in a hilarious and yeah lots of

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,799
problems so obviously we want to use UTC

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,510
we don't wanna use time zones but that

00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,940
in itself has a lot of other problems

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,070
because if you only use UTC there are

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,899
fundamental questions you cannot answer

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:05,049
without additional information for

00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:08,139
example was day or night well I I don't

00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:10,149
know depends were on the planet what day

00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:12,519
was it was a Tuesday and Wednesday again

00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:16,840
depends where it was on the planet so

00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:21,370
UTC is not enough okay maybe we have to

00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:24,460
store both but time itself can go long

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:26,110
okay it's not only time zones people

00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,429
assume that we have 24 hours in a day

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:31,389
you know that's not true

00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:35,230
you can have 25 or 23 and 23 but we

00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:37,600
don't have 365 years and days in a year

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,100
because we have the leap year but then

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,559
we have the leap seconds so having once

00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:46,539
in a while in every few years we have 61

00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:48,250
seconds in a minute time of course is

00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:51,490
not infinite as we found out in the y2k

00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,419
bug because like no one thought that 100

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,120
years would pass

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:57,820
actually it was like more like 20 but

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,010
actually the clock itself can you know

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,440
jump forward and backwards because we

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:06,039
think all the time that creates a lot of

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:10,510
problems so time is not as simple as

00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:12,820
people assume numbers is one form of

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:14,559
digital storage okay and in a computer

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,840
system we can store integers week

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,630
installed floats we can saw signed or

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,220
unsigned numbers we can store the of

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,110
course every number has resolution the

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,620
resolution of an integer is exactly 1

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:28,779
and each number has bound ok you cannot

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:34,990
store infinite numbers in computer of

00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:36,940
course so in for example so integers so

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,100
this analogy would behave for example I

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,049
have an integer which I've said it to

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,519
meeeee accent and as you can see it's

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,019
above zero but when I add one it

00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:45,610
suddenly below zero because it's over

00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:48,159
left and this is a phenomena that

00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,690
happens in all computer systems some one

00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,119
times work around this photo matically

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,009
some

00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:53,689
don't and this can happen little Tidus

00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:56,569
creates a lot of problem when you model

00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:58,789
data on integers so we might be tempted

00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:00,409
you to use floats for most stuff but

00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:02,659
they have problems of their own

00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:04,069
when you do this for example you get

00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,529
this weird result which is inaccurate

00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:08,899
and of course most of the time we don't

00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:10,939
care because it's a very very very tiny

00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:13,459
difference unless of course we're

00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:16,369
dealing with money as we've seen in open

00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:18,439
space tiny fractions of a cent can add

00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:19,939
up to a lot of money and if you use

00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:22,399
money you don't want to do that because

00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:24,379
money cannot overflow ever ever ever

00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,299
you don't want you to get your salary

00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:29,089
and then suddenly all the money a lot of

00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,729
money all the bank a lot of money and of

00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:33,139
course it shouldn't have rounding arrows

00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:36,019
because then someone loses and someone

00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:38,209
gains money out of thin air but things

00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:40,039
that convert the money can be float and

00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:42,199
you have conversion arrows because of

00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,119
that so really really complicated and

00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:46,189
annoying if you do if you actually write

00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,929
software for money use big decimal for

00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:51,859
money otherwise you will have lots of

00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:53,689
problems so what do we want to do we

00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:55,639
want to learn how to store to do data

00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:58,909
modeling properly so we can avoid all

00:20:55,639 --> 00:21:00,469
those problems first step in doing data

00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:03,019
modeling is to remember that we stole

00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:04,759
facts we do not store relative data we

00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:07,159
want to store stuff that is absolute it

00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,379
does not change in time in fact this is

00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:10,249
absolute data for example birth date is

00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:14,959
a fact

00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:16,699
whereas age is not ages relative and new

00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:19,999
facts can be added for example if you're

00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:22,429
dead I will add a new fact that is the

00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:25,129
date of your death okay and then I can

00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:27,499
compute everything from that okay every

00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:31,249
fact has to come the timestamp of when

00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:33,169
it was true I want to use extensible

00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:35,929
formats and extensible datatypes of

00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:37,399
course because I can keep adding up more

00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:39,109
data and of course some data might be

00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:41,719
missing maybe because just data I

00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:43,159
haven't collected or maybe because no

00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:45,409
for other reasons maybe someone didn't

00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:48,139
want to provide that data or maybe it's

00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:51,259
a new field okay I need a way to express

00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:52,429
missing data I want to store metadata so

00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:55,189
I can debug the data

00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:57,349
so examples metadata though I want to

00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,969
stole is the the date of collection the

00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:01,250
software versions that I've used to

00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:03,590
collect the data for example if I have

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,880
we're data I go back to the so to the

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,220
software the collected they looked the

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,780
version up sometimes I find that maybe

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,390
the form was bad or maybe it has a

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,100
misleading question and so on okay I

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,650
want you to make sure that I know how it

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,539
was collected by whom okay which

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:20,870
personal system entered data and so on

00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:23,000
so on so on first step

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,070
pretty fine intended usage this is why

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,990
our example before was bad we didn't

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,419
define what was the purpose of the

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,760
modeling what you need an HR system in

00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:34,520
which case we care about legal entities

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,380
or was it a social network in which case

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,750
we care about the social constructs and

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,280
so on how are we going to use it okay

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,320
and of course we might store multiple

00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,059
version for different different for

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,450
different use cases for example we could

00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:49,850
store family name and first name and the

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,650
full name which in which people can just

00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,350
enter whatever they feel like okay

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:55,190
because it's for multiple purposes and

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,650
that makes sense

00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,210
second step select the subset of

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,470
information that you need think about

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,400
what you need them what you don't need

00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:06,710
make a very very explicit decision about

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,330
this and document why because this might

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,450
change as you gain more information

00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:14,090
about the business define the

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,429
constraints we have constraints that are

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,200
digital we have physical constraints we

00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:20,179
have a lot of other constraints define

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,950
them what should be the resolution what

00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:25,220
should be the bound and what data type

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,419
should you use and then finally didn't

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,070
define the collector not finally but

00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:30,770
define the collection method how are you

00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,120
going to convert this information are

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,250
you going to use a form are you going to

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,010
use a digital to analog converter you

00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,230
use a camera how are you going to use

00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:42,890
the camera and so on so on so on is the

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:44,750
conversion lossy or non lossy the format

00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,220
can be lost your known loss and so on so

00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,840
on so on you have to take into account

00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,679
that in any conversion there are

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,990
artifacts

00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,610
so think about the possible artifacts

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,679
that can arise from the conversion and

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,470
make sure that the collection method is

00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,179
versioned okay because it might change

00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:02,809
in the future and you want to be able to

00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:06,080
track that select a compatible data type

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:07,669
when for storage okay it can be a

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,740
universal data type and it could be a

00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:12,110
specific data type for example dates if

00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,330
you store them in a string okay this is

00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,690
a universal data type but then you have

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:19,030
to have a

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:21,350
secondary format usually either ISO 8601

00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:23,090
which tells you how to read this thing

00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,790
and convert it into a date that you can

00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:28,430
actually use remember again there can be

00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,800
possible artifacts to the format PNG and

00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,960
JPEG is a good example and this of

00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,880
course should be versioned okay so we'll

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,000
skip that but when any one you will want

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,760
to look after in the slides and see an

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,360
example have me model better then that'd

00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,780
be awesome

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,970
there's a QR code and link to a github

00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:50,120
repository online that is very very good

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:52,100
thanks sauce by the way which contains a

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,230
lot of articles about falsehood in data

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,600
and for foods that programmers believe

00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,420
about stuff really interestingly very

00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,920
hilarious I highly recommend it ok go

00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:05,420
lunch thank you

00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,420
