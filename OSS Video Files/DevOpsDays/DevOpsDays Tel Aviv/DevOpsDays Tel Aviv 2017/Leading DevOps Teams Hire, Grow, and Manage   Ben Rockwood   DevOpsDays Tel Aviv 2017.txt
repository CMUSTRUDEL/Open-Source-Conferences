hello Shalom thank you for coming i am

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,170
ben Rockwood I'm the director of IT

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,390
operations at chef software I've been

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,340
there for about three years by way of

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,689
introduction before I was there I spent

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,470
about ten years at a company called

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:29,400
giant has anyone ever heard of joint yes

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,000
a couple so in in a previous life and

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,410
the the 90s I was a system administrator

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,390
specializing in large mid-range systems

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,000
so I didn't want to work on any computer

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,530
that cost less than a million dollars I

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,390
didn't have a Ferrari but I had a really

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,079
big computer so that was good enough for

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,340
me and I became an expert in in Solaris

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,649
and in particular a couple of

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,840
technologies like ZFS and DTrace and

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,590
silane called zones that eventually

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,930
became renamed containers and in 2005

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,620
some people came to me and said hey we

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,420
want to start a grid company and we we

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,840
want to create an you know a whole new

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,850
way of sort of doing things and we're

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,619
gonna build it entirely based on Solaris

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,659
zones and you're the zones guys so let's

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,250
let's go do that and we ended up

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,759
building what eventually became called a

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,920
cloud and one of our little competitors

00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,229
at the stupid bookstore started up about

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,350
the same time as we did and they kind of

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,659
one but our cloud was definitely more

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,240
technically brilliant but ultimately

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,700
didn't didn't get it so it's been a

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,960
bunch of years in cloud and got to work

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,150
with a lot of fun companies if you've

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,470
ever worked for a hosting company it's

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,840
super interesting to see all the

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,720
interesting ideas that come along it's

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,360
funny how many great ideas fail it's

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,380
also interesting how many crazy ideas

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,899
succeed in particular I had one customer

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,670
who came along they were a good customer

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,170
but they were kind of a handful they

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,290
seemed to have a lot of problems that

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,090
need a lot of help and so we did our

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,579
best to support them but they had this

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,200
crazy idea where you would go to their

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,580
website and you would enter this message

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,160
that was only 140 characters long and I

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,239
first like this is cute you know but I

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,170
don't think it's really gonna go

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,810
anywhere guys

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:20,310
you know this doesn't make any sense and

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:22,830
Twitter resulted so man I really got

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,590
that one wrong on the plus side I have

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,870
probably the oldest Twitter account of

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,069
anyone because I had to register with

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,720
them so that I could hook it into our

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:34,470
monitoring system because if they went

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,180
down I was probably getting a call if I

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,100
had known that it would become as big as

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,410
it did I would have probably actually

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,780
registered not my UNIX user name Ben R

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,459
but Ben and then sold it to like Ben

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:50,910
Affleck for like a million dollars but

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:53,580
had had no idea when I was running the

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:57,000
cloud we had built a really interesting

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,160
technical product and around 2008 about

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,730
three years into this cloud I had built

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,390
a really competent Operations team and I

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,910
stepped back and asked myself is this

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,670
the best operations team in the world I

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,410
thought I had built the most

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,830
sophisticated and the best operations

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,630
team in the world but of course I would

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,250
think that like I mean how would I how

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,750
would I know otherwise right a lot of us

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,790
didn't really share at the time sort of

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,870
what our processes and what what it

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,760
actually looked like inside of our

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,560
operations teams so I went around and I

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,570
started looking and asking questions and

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,950
just reading everything I possibly could

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:37,109
get my hands on and a short while later

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,120
I found a fella named Patrick Dubois and

00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:40,650
John Willis and a couple of others who

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,380
were also thinking about this same

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,230
problem what does good look like how

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,940
should it work and then next thing we

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,190
know we had a conference called DevOps

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,750
days and I've been really sort of

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,280
involved with DevOps ever since but I've

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,560
been particularly interested because of

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,670
this this history I've been very

00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,850
interested in this sort of the

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:03,060
management side because as you know I

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:06,260
was I was effectively one of if not the

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,250
best Solaris administrators in the world

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,720
I'd written books I had the most

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,700
respected blog I was on the up and

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,380
Solaris governing board I helped with

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,280
all kinds of things of getting that

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,810
launched I was the best I had arrived

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,530
does anyone know me as a Solaris guy

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:25,680
does anyone run Solaris No

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,690
the joy he'd still run Solaris the

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,950
technology comes and goes it was a sad

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,750
thing but what I realized what was

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,700
really important was the people right

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,830
the people the people stay the teams

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,389
stay the team is still there today

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,980
they're still working hard and so I

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,960
became sort of less impassioned by the

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,200
technology and how I was going to become

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,520
the best at any one thing because a

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,830
couple of years later it was going to

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,110
change and I thought Solaris could never

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,850
possibly go away son could never

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,310
possibly go away it was too successful

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,350
it was too big it was too important the

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:02,430
world ran its business on Sun machines

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:04,110
and it didn't matter it's gone and so I

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,100
got really interested in obsessed with

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,180
with sort of management how we do things

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,160
and one of the things my biggest

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,290
contribution to to to the world of

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,390
DevOps was really putting an emphasis on

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,490
learning from the Japanese and learning

00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,229
from lean and learning from the early

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,770
days of Management because there was a

00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:25,100
number of books I noticed around

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:27,060
2009/2010 we were reading like the goal

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,979
but nobody had really seem to ever

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,729
explore deeper than that where did the

00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,840
ideas from of gold rats come from what

00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:35,520
what are the other ideas that were

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,380
wrapped around it people sort of said

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,600
Kaizen but what did that mean where to

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,450
come from and so I spent a lot of time

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,430
with that in 2011 I gave a keynote at

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,120
the Lisa conference where I explored the

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,380
entire history of operations management

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,190
from the turn of the 20th century

00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,900
through to to today and and it worked

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,600
out we've been talking a lot about lean

00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,410
so in this this talk what I'm going to

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,640
do is I'm going to sort of decompose

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,080
management and growing teams and

00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,970
building teams into two different ways

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,070
because it's a really complex topic that

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,500
can't possibly be handled appropriately

00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,720
in 40 minutes so I'm going to decompose

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,550
it in two different ways one is from a

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,160
systems point of view in terms of the

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,300
overall goal and then secondly we're

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,729
going to look at it from sort of an

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,650
employee lifecycle point of view first

00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,630
things first

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:27,000
systems thinking everything everything

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,250
everything always begins with systems

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,320
thinking everything is a system you are

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,599
a system your organization is the system

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,180
your family is a system your company is

00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:37,710
a system we log into systems we

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,680
use those systems to build larger

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,590
systems everything everywhere is a

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,360
system you know in this case I want to

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,780
sort of emphasize in this picture just

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,970
because you know props to the IDF but

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,910
the others is that she is as much a part

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,889
of the system as that plane is as the

00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,690
hangar is every single thing in that

00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:01,530
picture is part of an integrated system

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:03,810
and we need to focus not just on the

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,120
hardware we also need to focus on the

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,070
people involved in that system they're

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,710
the most resilient the most capable and

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,490
the most important piece of that system

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,830
because that part of the system is you

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:22,680
so we're going to decompose this system

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:27,599
down into five pieces diversity vision

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,900
strategy management and tools now this

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,820
applies to everyone everywhere all the

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,940
time because like I said everything is a

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,630
system so how many of you are managers

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,440
or somebody reports to you in some way

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:44,400
ok cool

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,020
anybody who isn't one of those you are a

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,840
part of that system because you're the

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,360
recipient of it so if you were leading a

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,860
team if you're managing people I want

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,490
you as we go through these to think

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,080
about you and your teams and how they

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,599
perceive it what you can do for them if

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,550
you're not managing people I want you to

00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,830
think about how you're being managed by

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,599
your organization how this impacts you

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,509
and I also want you to think about you

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:13,320
as an individual all these same things

00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:15,630
apply to you as an individual start with

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,190
diversity diversity is a hot-button

00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,840
topic it's something that's really

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,919
important particularly in United States

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,990
I have mentioned that it's probably

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,159
uniquely important here in Israel but

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,110
what's important is is that diversity

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:30,270
doesn't happen despite our differences

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,060
it happens because of our differences

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,800
and I want to emphasize diversity in a

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,829
slightly different way than it might be

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,149
brought up socially or politically I'm

00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:44,310
not actually terribly interested in

00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:49,620
diversity in terms of sexual preference

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:51,240
or gender or nationality or religion

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,160
all those things are important but

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,790
what's even more important is thought

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,470
diversity of thought I don't want a

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,480
bunch of people from a bunch of

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,520
different backgrounds in my company just

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,990
because their skin colors are different

00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,270
or the nationalities are different I

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,520
want those people to come to my

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,220
organization because of the fact that

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,150
they think differently they come from

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,220
different backgrounds they have

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:17,100
different perspectives that's what's

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,570
important I don't want to just go out

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,580
and hire women just because it's good to

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,320
hire women I want women who think

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,089
differently I want men who think

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,150
differently I want all those different

00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:29,610
people to bring their own unique

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:32,339
perspective to our organizations because

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,680
innovation requires new ideas that's

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,050
what innovation is and what I

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,940
unfortunately see in a lot of companies

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,350
is companies who talk about diversity

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,430
and they bring a lot of different people

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,779
who look very different

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,150
their bodies are very different their

00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,730
preferences are very different but if

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,440
they all think the same they'll want to

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,660
the same sort of university or they all

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,060
have the same sort of background and so

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,650
what I did I don't I have the same ideas

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,470
just from different sort of individuals

00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,930
I want people who truly bring themselves

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,640
than whole-cell their whole cells to

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,760
bring brand new ideas things that I

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,700
wouldn't think of right and so we need

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,160
to create environments in which radical

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,100
ideas can actually flow and encourage

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,040
those differences and bring them out the

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,800
thing that we want to control is not the

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,959
people but the process by which we bring

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,020
all those people together and the

00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:28,290
crazier their ideas the better when you

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,060
think about innovation most of the most

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,790
interesting innovation started out with

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,900
somebody saying I have a crazy idea this

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,720
thing will never work this is the

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,279
dumbest thing you've ever heard but dot

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,920
dot and then something brilliant

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,770
happened we don't want to stamp that out

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,660
we want to encourage it another thing is

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,430
when you think about organizations any

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,060
type of organization where it's a family

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,520
a country a religious movement a club

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,870
does it matter

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,510
diversity is what defines sort of who's

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:00,030
invited to the party who's allowed to

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,350
participate right and so we want as

00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,320
broad a net

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:07,020
possible but once we have a broad base

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,610
of people involved we then have to bring

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,650
them together some way we have to be

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,020
unified and the way that we unify is

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:16,410
through vision a unity of purpose and

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,760
shared identity it doesn't matter who's

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,300
actually involved so long as we have

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:25,290
that shared vision so we want to it

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:27,930
rally individuals to a cause and we want

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,820
to align them all to a common vision

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,250
because when we online to a single

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,870
vision we can unlock passions and you

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,970
want passionate people you don't want

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,200
people to be calm and to shut up and sit

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,580
down you want them to come out with

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,210
their crazy ideas again that's the

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,960
innovation we want to encourage

00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,030
differences we want to encourage

00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,670
conflict we want to encourage challenge

00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,860
but we want to do it in a sort of

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,150
controlled way in the way that we're

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,680
gonna do that is by making sure we're

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,000
all aligned to a single vision so that

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:59,310
we're all pulling in the same direction

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,230
towards a common goal when it comes to

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,430
vision there are lots of books that have

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,190
been written on this and they're almost

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:09,870
universally useless right

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:11,880
lots of flowery statements I think what

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,710
Solomon sort of got it got it best in

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,810
Proverbs where the where there is no

00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,060
vision the people perish this is one of

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,880
the reasons I have a huge affinity to

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:25,040
the Jewish people talk about people with

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:28,140
a vision right you've persevered through

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,300
centuries when many's others have come

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:34,380
and gone and the Jewish people are here

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,910
because of a vision right so once we've

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,430
got a bunch of people into our club and

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:41,820
we've got a shared vision about where we

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:44,550
want to go we then need to focus all

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,130
that energy and direct it and we direct

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:52,320
through strategy we want to channel that

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:54,210
vision into actual action there are laws

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,340
anybody ever worked for a company that

00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,840
had a really great vision like you were

00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,240
super stoked to work there and then he

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,940
got there and they had like no way to

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,570
actually make it happen or the strategy

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:09,330
to get there was absolute crap right

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,190
right we've all sort of been there and

00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,170
it breaks our heart to write there's all

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,939
these weird existential moments that you

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,439
have we're

00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:16,939
like I love what they're doing but I

00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:18,679
can't believe that they're doing all

00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:19,389
wrong and it's got to fail and it breaks

00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:24,139
your heart

00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:25,609
strategies super-important Eisenhower

00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:27,949
had one of the best quotes ever about

00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:29,359
strategy which is in preparing for

00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:30,799
battle I've always found that plans are

00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:32,989
useless but planning is indispensable

00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,789
you need to spend a lot of time figuring

00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:36,949
out what your strategy is going to be

00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:39,439
and thinking it through as to how that

00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,569
might play out the thing though is the

00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:43,899
plans that you produce out of your

00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:46,970
strategy probably will never work out

00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:48,559
but you won't be prepared for what's got

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,439
to come if you hadn't gone through the

00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:55,489
exercise the exercise is still hugely

00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:57,470
important now for strategy there are a

00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:59,239
couple of great resources out there the

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:03,049
business model canvas is a wonderful

00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:05,089
tool is incredibly applicable to a

00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:06,979
number of different place situations

00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:08,809
there was even a version of the business

00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:11,869
model canvas that was created called I

00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:13,489
think it was business model you where it

00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:15,499
was using the business model canvas to

00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:17,389
look at yourself in your own career your

00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:20,869
own skills to see sort of where you

00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:24,949
wanted to go so broadly applicable and

00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:26,959
also more directly involved in strategy

00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:28,970
playing to win as a book by Martin it

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,679
was really really handy for a more

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:34,970
business centric sort of view of

00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:37,309
strategy and once we've gotten through

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,019
we've got a strategy and we're moving in

00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,609
a direction we now have to manage it

00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,829
this is the day-to-day operations of

00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:46,189
ensuring that we're on track to meet the

00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:48,019
vision and to execute the strategy and

00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:52,220
to deal with all those changes that come

00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:54,919
up and come along now in large

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,359
organizations a lot of things are going

00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:59,059
to be dictated from you down from the

00:14:56,359 --> 00:15:01,879
top and so managers are really going to

00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:03,349
just sort of keep things on track and

00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,470
keep things moving according to what was

00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:08,809
dictated from on high but in smaller

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,959
organizations you really have to be a

00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:13,429
leader and I would say that actually in

00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:16,519
any organization no matter how

00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:19,249
bureaucratic you actually can still take

00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,169
a lead role and not just accept what's

00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:22,909
come down from above but go through

00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:24,549
those previous steps and don't just

00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:27,560
accept what you were told

00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:30,140
reinterpret the vision

00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:34,130
the strategy and understand how you and

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:37,630
your team can fit into it and lead

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:39,980
forward in your own unique way so

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,600
managers are continuously assessing and

00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,240
directing and changing according to

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,520
circumstances this is the the day-to-day

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,089
function this is also what causes us in

00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,800
that hustle and bustle to forget about

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:53,810
the vision and the strategy and to just

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,750
get connected to the latest and loudest

00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,760
fire and that's dangerous we constantly

00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,080
need to be yanked out of that it's one

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,060
of the reasons that I'm giving this talk

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,440
is I don't think I'm probably telling

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,620
anyone here anything you haven't heard

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:12,200
before but we all need to hear it all

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:14,779
the time because we forget we build

00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,420
policy and process to reduce friction

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:19,580
right sometimes I think people get way

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,660
too scared about process in policy all

00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:27,470
processes is how you do that all

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,610
policy is is a precomputed decision what

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,770
do we do about this if such-and-such

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,580
occurs I don't know let's think about it

00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,770
ahead of time

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,390
write it down is a policy and then when

00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,040
it happens we'll know what to do without

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,980
having to think it through in the heat

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,300
of the moment when it comes to

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,520
management there are lots of great books

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:47,060
my favorites are the fifth discipline

00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,010
bison gay the new economics by Deming

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,110
recreating the corporation by a cough

00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:54,470
which if you want to read a hardcore one

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:58,150
read a cough he's the best and classic

00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:00,950
was the book management by Drucker and

00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,810
then below management we get into tools

00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,429
there are lots of individual sort of

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,319
problems that we have on a day to day

00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,329
basis and there are a lot of tools out

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,339
there to help us with this so just like

00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,050
in technology we have lots of software

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:13,520
and lots of scripts and stuff that can

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,500
help us get done in management we have

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,290
lots of tools and frameworks that can

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,209
help us solve for specific sorts of

00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,699
problems then help avoid s falling to

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,770
come pitfalls with continuous

00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:30,170
improvement we have the whole corpus of

00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:31,550
lean we have cries n we have going to

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,330
the gemba we have all these great ideas

00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:38,000
that are out there from oh no and and

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:40,250
and others in problem-solving a tool

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
that I use all the time is called a3

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,290
does anyone

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,330
heard of a three okay so I don't have to

00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,060
ask anyone's using it a three is one of

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:53,360
the most powerful tools available I use

00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:56,690
it constantly in my in my teams I gave a

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,660
talk at Seattle DevOps days last year I

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,520
think on using a three it's really

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,660
powerful long story short it's

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,800
essentially a way of taking the

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,800
scientific method and bringing it to

00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,930
business and using it as a way to sort

00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,340
of control flow so anytime you don't

00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,960
know how to solve a problem or you're

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,680
not sure you found the right way to

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,360
solve a problem

00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,730
III can actually help guide you through

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,650
the process to come up with the best

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,680
possible solution it's integral to the

00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:27,470
way that Toyota implement sky Zen so

00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,410
it's the real power behind Kaizen so if

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,670
you've always thought that this

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,500
continuous improvement was this weird

00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,720
kind of fluffy idea that didn't seem to

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,980
have any real meat to it look at a three

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,490
that's the meat of how you actually

00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:42,020
implement Kaizen operations we have lots

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,990
of frameworks some good some bad

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,240
all of them have wisdom that we can take

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:50,120
from them ITIL and COBIT are two big

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,210
ones and they are big and they are scary

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,130
but one thing I would say I've always

00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,170
been a huge fan of ITIL if you've never

00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:00,800
if you're not a fan of ITIL or you think

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:04,730
that it's it's as horribly bureaucratic

00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,200
nonsense step back and actually find the

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,600
books if you can find the book somewhere

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,210
ITIL is actually a series of five books

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,320
read the actual books they're really

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:18,350
really good it is the IT infrastructure

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,180
library there's all kinds of things in

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,100
there some of its great some of its not

00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,130
but don't dismiss it out of hand it's

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:27,350
very helpful

00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,450
conv and scrum and generally systems

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,400
thinking design thinking complexity

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,870
theory there's lots of ideas out there

00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,640
and there are lots of tools that we can

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:38,720
apply but again sort of five components

00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,000
here diversity vision strategy

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,910
management and tools and I want to be

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,640
really clear we talk a lot in DevOps

00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:51,020
about culture what is it what is culture

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,080
we say it like it's just the one bullet

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:58,470
point on a slide do culture

00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,529
easy I would say that it's these five

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:03,000
things from which your culture comes

00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:05,789
these are the ingredients of your

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,080
culture right in any culture what is the

00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,490
way that we do things what are the ways

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,789
that we think what brings us together

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:15,529
who are we who's a part of our group all

00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:18,000
these things combined to create culture

00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:19,860
this is how we decompose culture and

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,289
really think about culture and when you

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,059
get into this you'll have things like

00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:26,580
you know we believe in continuous

00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:28,860
integration we believe in security we

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,269
believe in QA those are all things

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,769
they're gonna fall into management and

00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:33,419
tools and how we actually implement

00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:35,639
things and become a part of your culture

00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:39,480
but your culture is all these things

00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:43,740
together and when they add up okay

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:47,159
and again this applies to teams right

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,860
okay I work for a bank for instance if I

00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:53,190
work for a bank and I have a team of

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,990
five individuals I can go through all

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,419
these steps and I can have a unique

00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,159
culture in that team I mean let's all

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:02,190
remember devops started from the

00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,860
grassroots right those of us especially

00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,509
early on we did this because nobody and

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,549
our senior management or executive

00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:11,700
management teams was thinking about it

00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,950
or cared their concerns for diversity

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,240
vision and strategy all were focused on

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,549
sort of where the company was got to do

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:21,659
they could give a what's going on

00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:23,220
in operations right and to be fair

00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:24,960
rightly so they've got bigger concerns

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,539
right like making sure the company is

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,120
profitable so we had to do all these

00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:32,610
exercises in the operations team to see

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,309
what is our you know what are our values

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,899
who do we bring into our organization

00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:38,610
who do we want why do we want them what

00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:40,169
is the vision how we get to execute it

00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:43,379
which is a subset of the overall

00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:47,639
organization this is also true for your

00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:50,850
family this is also true for you as an

00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:53,929
individual okay now I'm going to

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:55,799
decompose it in a slightly different way

00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:58,169
and we're gonna look at the employee

00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:00,450
lifecycle as a systems thinker I love

00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:02,250
life cycles I love life cycles because

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:06,980
everything happens in a life cycle it

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:09,830
begins as a it grows it sort of tapers

00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:17,299
and then it dies everything whether it's

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:19,700
a laptop or you it has a lifecycle now

00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:21,710
this is a model that I kind of borrowed

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,169
from the social work place it was a

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:26,090
really good model because it has some

00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:28,400
additional elements we don't often think

00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,600
about and so because this is a little

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,220
hard to read I'm going to sort of

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,500
decompose it and do a couple of

00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:38,380
different sort of functions so this is

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:41,059
time and we have a couple of processes

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:45,799
attraction recruitment onboarding

00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:47,450
development retention and separation you

00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,610
should be thinking about all these from

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,440
the beginning right we want to attract

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,390
people to our organization we want to

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,790
recruit them in and hire them we want to

00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,679
onboard them make them successful we

00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,760
want to grow them and develop them then

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,410
we want to hold on to them because we

00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,660
just invested a lot of time energy and

00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,580
money into these people and at some

00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,890
point they're going to leave and so we

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,299
need to be thinking about separation one

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,940
thing that people really don't spend

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:14,390
enough time thinking about from a

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,650
managerial duties standpoint what do we

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,390
need to be thinking about it's managers

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:20,000
in the beginning we need to be thinking

00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,510
about hiring how we're gonna hire who

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,040
were gonna hire

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,450
we're gonna go to DevOps days Tel Aviv

00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,620
and hire some people we're gonna go

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,740
somewhere else we're gonna look on

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,510
linkedin we're gonna go once they come

00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,799
in as managers we now need to be

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,870
thinking about how do we inspire these

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,460
people to get that the most out of them

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,630
to make them successful to make them

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,429
happy to get them to contributing

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,280
there's a lot of things that are going

00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:43,580
to fall out of that but we're gonna be

00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,650
inspiring the people now I hear sign up

00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,620
but most of you wish that your managers

00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,820
would do is once you've gone on board

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,790
and you've been developed you're up to

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:55,730
speed and you're into the organization

00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:58,790
managers need to be admiring you this is

00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:03,559
a this is a fundamental need we all have

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:05,990
is are we doing a good job do they want

00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:07,820
us here do they need us here should I

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:10,790
say here right

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:13,640
we deeply desperately need to be admired

00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:15,799
in our work this assignment as managers

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,150
we have to be thinking about or you will

00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:19,549
pay the consequences

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,750
and most of do and at some point we need

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:23,150
to be as managers thing

00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:26,080
about retiring people for a variety of

00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,970
different reasons the engagement curve

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,530
we bring somebody in they're excited I

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,790
can't believe I'm so glad to be here

00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:35,270
it's awesome

00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:37,130
very high engagement as we get through

00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,460
here generally based on whether or not

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,930
you're admired your engagement is going

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,850
to go up and down life is going to

00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,040
happen things are gonna happen you're

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,320
gonna get interested in things get bored

00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,090
of things like people not like people

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,140
who get a very variable low engagement

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,120
and then we're gonna have a very low

00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:56,090
engagement towards the end generally

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,040
when we see engagement drop and your

00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,900
heart's just not in it so we tend to say

00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,650
that's what we need to be moving into

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:06,830
retirement preparing people to leave the

00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,630
organization now what's going to

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,490
motivate the employee through each of

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,800
these phases to tie it back to our

00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,780
earlier discussion early on a lot of its

00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,680
gonna be vision right you joined a

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,850
company because they're going to do

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,480
something amazing and you want to be a

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:23,810
part of it right generally that's why

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,660
you come along once you sort of get them

00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:28,610
through recruiting and hiring our

00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,620
concerns become a lot more practical

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,600
strategy what do I need to actually do

00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,750
why am I here what is when am I actually

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,190
going to do how do I actually fulfill it

00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,390
and then generally there's a swing back

00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,270
after people have on-boarded when

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,040
they've kind of gotten over the first

00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:47,750
generally six to eight weeks and you

00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,850
start to kind of ease into the role

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,740
you'll then only you'll generally sort

00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,960
of relax a little bit and then stop and

00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,480
say okay wait a second the vision why am

00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,330
I here what am i doing are we really in

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,040
alignment and that vision is what's

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,620
really going to engage them whether or

00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,360
not you're true to that vision and then

00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,280
we come into the long phase of personal

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,350
development we need to be personally

00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,440
developing our people if you're not a

00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:14,990
manager your manager should be helping

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,600
you develop your organization should be

00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,640
providing opportunities to coach you to

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,690
teach you to grow you and if they're not

00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,550
you're being cheated and then finally

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,290
towards the end here the thing that's

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,640
going to sort of the motivation that's

00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,410
sort of in most of our minds when we get

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,990
towards separation and retirement tends

00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,340
to be opportunity I'm either going up or

00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,010
on going

00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:38,980
now if you're not providing

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,690
opportunities for people to get a

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,420
promotion or move into new roles and new

00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:46,450
duties and to expand themselves they

00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:50,070
will leave and most people don't want to

00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:53,170
leave leavings hard and difficult so

00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:56,170
opportunity is a real strong motivator

00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:58,030
for all of us and as managers we need to

00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:01,180
be thinking about are we providing the

00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:03,130
opportunity to retain our people because

00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:06,160
if we're not they're out of there and we

00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:09,460
need to be anticipating that and so some

00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,930
managerial sort of focuses that we need

00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,600
to have early on we need to be thinking

00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,920
a lot and we go to hire people about

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,810
what are the positions available and

00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:20,440
where we're gonna pay people here's one

00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:22,810
thing I will say about pay when it comes

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,600
to compensation you are not buying

00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:27,820
somebody's work I am you're not a

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,390
machine I am not buying your output

00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:34,840
I am compensating you for your time and

00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:38,590
your attention what you output during

00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,920
that time will vary generally based on

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,330
personal development in admiration the

00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,980
other thing is I always say you know

00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:47,830
people want to say you know you know -

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,240
people are motivated by money oh you're

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,650
not motivated by money fundamentally

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,200
most of us are not motivated by your

00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:57,610
mutton by money our Y's are our spouses

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,750
are they care a lot right it's another

00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,580
thing that's really important to point

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,930
out you know almost every time I have

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,060
ever given somebody a pay raise no

00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,890
matter how big it is there was like okay

00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,060
you know thanks that's it I'm like dude

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,470
you were supposed to like jump up and

00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,990
down and hug me and give me a kiss

00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,220
because you were so excited then I just

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,440
gave you this great increase initially

00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,610
that's okay that's fine right what do

00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,610
they do they go home to their spouse

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,770
because I'm awesome it's really

00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,240
important you need to be thinking about

00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,950
at the beginning that also means that

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,420
you need to be thinking if your managers

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,800
that are hiring you need to be thinking

00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,480
not just and not just about what you're

00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,830
gonna pay people when they come in the

00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,910
door to attract them in the door you

00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:37,510
need to be thinking about where to pay

00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:39,130
them in a year two years three years be

00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:42,130
thinking about their growth otherwise

00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,930
you're gonna go really close to

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,040
retirement and low engagement way too

00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:50,230
early because they lack opportu

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,850
culture as managers you really ought to

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,549
be thinking about culture when it comes

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:56,530
to onboarding because the time to put

00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:59,020
culture in place and embed it into a

00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,750
person's mind as they on board once

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,830
they're on board there's not a lot of

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,020
changes gonna happen you're gonna be

00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,580
evaluating each of us do evaluate our

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,500
organizations based on this is what you

00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,179
said this is what you said what I what I

00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,840
thought you were gonna do and you do any

00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:13,900
of that

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,000
what's wrong with you so culture is

00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:18,730
really important to manage early to be

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,710
thinking about not later but as you

00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:23,080
onboard people as you get them in the

00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:25,660
door and putting all the sort of values

00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,860
and stuff into them as we develop people

00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,080
as managers we got to be thinking about

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,429
learning and challenges are we going to

00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,700
develop them or we going to give them

00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:36,070
opportunities and challenge them give

00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,410
them new problems right everyone likes

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:41,160
to be pushed we also need safety in that

00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:43,450
that you have the opportunity to fail

00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,960
and continue to grow otherwise you get

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:49,150
discouraged like I said as we come later

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,250
into sort of around the one-year mark

00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,330
year and a half mark you got to be

00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,970
thinking about organization and

00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:57,040
promotion right do we have a place to

00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,010
move these people if not we need to

00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,720
start thinking about separation early

00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,860
right if I can't promote you you're

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,130
probably gonna want to go and so I

00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,030
should be thinking about that early on

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,620
and when it comes to separation

00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,540
managerially we got to be super

00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,559
concerned about knowledge transfer right

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,330
this is one of the reasons that

00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,500
organizationally we have to think as

00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,660
managers we need to be thinking about

00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,880
separation very early in the process

00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,919
you've got an individual who has a lot

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,410
of skills a lot of experience and it's

00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,090
going to walk out the door with them

00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:27,700
right if you think about it if you want

00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,530
to be really cold about this most of us

00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:33,220
as organizations we invest a lot of time

00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:35,110
energy and money into individuals they

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,760
learn a bunch of things they add a lot

00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,460
of capability to the organization and

00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,970
then when they leave you all just take

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:45,669
it with you right we're all essentially

00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:48,820
thieves because what do we take to our

00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:52,720
future employer when we go back to the

00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,950
beginning of the cycle we walk in with

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,980
all the knowledge we acquired from the

00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,680
previous employer that's the biggest

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,720
form of compensation

00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,050
so you see that there's a couple of

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,020
interesting cycles that we have here we

00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:08,730
need to be thinking as managers about

00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,750
whether or not we're providing for these

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,170
things if we're thinking about it

00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:14,300
holistically from beginning to end from

00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:18,060
the very beginning

00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:20,130
furthermore if you're an employee is

00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,500
your purpose your organization providing

00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,900
any of these things is your manager even

00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,310
remotely competent are they taking care

00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,740
of you do they care about you are you

00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:31,700
just a cog in the wheel you might want

00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,890
to ask them now here's the other thing

00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,140
let's also remember remember everything

00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:40,020
is the system from the individual's

00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:43,230
point of view this is what their life

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:45,570
looks like right a long continuum of

00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:48,480
these cycles over and over and over some

00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,190
shorter some longer the average tenure

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,160
of an employee right now is between two

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,840
and three years right you got to take

00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,480
that into account from the beginning

00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:00,570
because you are just you know wherever

00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,340
you are right now right it's great but

00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,310
there's going to be another place so one

00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:12,300
thing I tell everyone who works for me

00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:15,270
is I tell them lots of things ok you're

00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,770
going to leave right which is weird

00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,150
they're they're all working for me right

00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,910
now I'm like you're going to leave me

00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:23,580
maybe tomorrow maybe any year maybe in

00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:26,550
10 years you're going to leave me

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,470
thinking about what you can take you

00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,630
know exploit the opportunity you have

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,400
now to learn in to grow so I would say

00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,930
to any of you particularly any of you

00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,090
who are currently in a role where you're

00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:38,250
bored and you don't like the place and

00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,960
you really kind of want to leave be

00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:42,180
thinking about how you can exploit the

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,340
role to get the most out of it

00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:48,660
use those challenges in order to sort of

00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:51,060
grow and move on so an assessment for

00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,070
your team for you take a step back look

00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,690
at the big picture question yourself in

00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,340
your alignment to the vision and the

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,320
strategy whether that's your family's

00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,360
vision and strategy whether that's your

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,960
personal vision and strategy or your

00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,540
organization's vision and strategy be

00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,210
realistic

00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:11,970
keep it simple always keep it simple

00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:13,860
embrace failure quickly which means just

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,260
- it figure out what you had to do and

00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,990
move on right don't hold on to it don't

00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,520
try to fix it and you know when it comes

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,230
to it you know you know embracing

00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,400
failure also you know work through the

00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:28,920
problem right when your servers go down

00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:31,170

00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,140

00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:37,020
it I'm done and then you shake it off

00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:39,000
and you fix it right do the same to

00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,480
yourself and to sort of your long-term

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,250
path and continuously learn and improve

00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:48,460
