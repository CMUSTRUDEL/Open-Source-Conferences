Publication date: 2017-11-28
Playlist: DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2017
Description: 
	Concur’s Digital Transformation from Monolith to Microservices; DevOps IRL

Concur has recently gone through this digital transformation of the business from a monolith application with 2 major releases per year to each 700+ developers who are committed to owning their own code in Production and owning performance from an end-to-end; giving product teams the ownership from design through production release and operations.

As Concur SRE we are here to put the right talent, practices, strategies, change control and ultimately global teamwork together to run todays high availability production operations business environment.

Group attendees would walk away with knowing:

well good morning Automator x' engineers

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,759
builders and janitors my name is Jason

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,769
Grimes I'm a site reliability

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,690
engineering expert from concur that's

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,539
back in the States over in Seattle

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,279
Washington we don't have quite the

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,859
skyline you guys do the weather here is

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,890
amazing this is my first DevOps day Tel

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:30,990
Aviv it's been awesome seriously

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,669
everybody's been thank you so so today

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,160
why are we even here I'm gonna talk a

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,739
little bit about concurs journey as they

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,110
move and break up the monolith and we're

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,430
gonna talk about our DevOps journey and

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,809
how it might be similar to some of the

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,590
DevOps journeys that you have begun

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,000
so concur is recently gone a

00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,120
transformation where we went from two

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,010
major releases per year to 700

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,160
developers owning their own code in

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,980
production so I am a sre manager I

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,050
manage one of two teams and we're

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,390
responsible for enabling those

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,670
developers to run code in production and

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,549
so we need to advise them give them the

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,880
best tools and practices

00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:13,890
so before I start you guys follow me

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,869
here DevOps is really about sharing it's

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,729
about this time right here where we all

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,369
come together and we learn this picture

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,259
is a at chef software headquarters in

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,500
downtown Seattle we meet every other

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,380
Fridays and we're you know to level up

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,520
and to get better so Who am I I'm Jason

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,939
I'm a dad

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,680
mountain biker I'm into music into STEM

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,200
site reliability engineering I'm a

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,880
DevOps champion I'm interested in

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,030
obviously team building leveling up and

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,149
recruiting so a little bit about me I'm

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,820
old I used a Commodore 64 when I started

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,579
I was playing Frogger on my dad's tape

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,799
drive I have a I have a decade of

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,360
on-premise data center experience with

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,060
that you could probably buy yourself a

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,630
coffee not super exciting I transitioned

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,430
to DevOps in sre in 2015 with concur I'm

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,180
a stem parent interested in science and

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,280
technology I believe in a growth mindset

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,379
mindset and what I really tried to do in

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,879
the last couple of years is open source

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,440
the things I do successfully and

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,960
continue to learn from the field such as

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,950
everyone

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,080
here so what will you walk away with

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,490
whether I hope you'll walk away with one

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,260
you'll have a little bit of a DevOps

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,180
journey it concur what what has that

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,890
transition been like we're gonna talk

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,750
about the people the commitment and the

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,910
journey we're gonna talk about building

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,280
great teams and not just tool sets and

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,250
of course measuring the customer

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,020
experience and I'll touch on obviously

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,680
level up and then my favorite topic is

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,780
the Automator z' so who is concur concur

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,120
provides visibility and to travel

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,970
expenses and invoice driven spending how

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,190
many people here use concur okay we have

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,260
some folks here so what do we see on a

00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,290
daily basis we see a lot of folks

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,780
uploading receipts I would say two point

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:03,490
two point four million expenses uploaded

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,900
each day 275 thousand trips booked but

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,110
the number that we're I'm most proud of

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,060
is the the invoices processed so what

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,880
what does our DevOps journey look like

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,580
so I mapped out our journey and I also

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,260
married it with the cell phones I was

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,930
using at the time so back in the

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,030
waterfall days I was using a blackberry

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,060
we had releases every nine to eighteen

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,850
months not very customer responsive if

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,130
we bet wrong it cost us and it cost us

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,900
big time and we were on premise services

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,150
at that time that's in the late 90s

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,470
early 2000s and the ops model was

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:40,990
formerly an IT moving to UPS so shortly

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,910
after that in the mid 2000s we moved to

00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,040
a mixed environment releases were about

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,470
every four months we were improving our

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,080
velocity we still have that monolithic

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,490
hybrid so we have Saturday deployments

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,630
nobody likes Saturday deployments and

00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,090
that is about the same time the iPhone

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,520
3G came out and the period that we're in

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,680
today I've got in blue and we're using

00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,150
the software development lifecycle we're

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,450
using agile I think most the folks

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,970
probably use agile here we we update our

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,550
releases once every month and we have

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,680
what we call Micro Services aspirations

00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,239
we have every intention to move to a

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,760
fully micro services environment but

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,040
right now the model it does pay the

00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,690
bills the model that we currently deploy

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,560
that we've been using since 2015 is

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,060
DevOps and I'm currently using is an

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,830
iPhone 7 so what

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,780
what does the future look like it's not

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,760
very different than right now

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,610
as as some of the other speakers had

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,320
mentioned more tools more software but

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,030
the release cycle will be continuous we

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,040
want to deploy thousands if not tens of

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,630
thousands of changes every day safely to

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,090
production the architecture will be

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,040
fully micro-services and the model that

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,210
we'll use to support this won't be very

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,310
different than what it is today

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,169
it'll be DevOps only you'll have the

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,389
option to be embedded within teams

00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,930
that's not currently where we are today

00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:00,880
so I want to walk you through my journey

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,100
through some of the the people that I

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,450
learned from the most one of the

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,630
gentlemen I used to work for David Getty

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:10,690
some Microsoft II now back when we were

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,120
doing waterfall releases every every 19

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,910
months he would say reliable repeatable

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,130
results over time and I would pound that

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,590
into my head as an up-and-coming ops

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:24,160
manager wanting to be reliable providing

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,530
a high level of service and at this time

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,270
I was actually the manager of a

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,419
technical operations team that was doing

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,310
online courseware so we had 250,000

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:36,160
students taking courses online every day

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:39,100
and so we were trying to be reliable

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,669
just as a school would but in 2006

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:45,100
anybody remember what happened in 2006

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:47,470
AWS came a-knockin and Werner Vogel said

00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,300
you build it you run it and I'm curious

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,400
how many folks have heard that you build

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,460
it you run it most folks in here okay

00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:58,930
it's been a principal for a long time

00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:01,690
but yeah outstanding and in 2010

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,180
John Willis Damon Edwards and Jes humble

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,320
came up with this idea of Calmes this

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,800
culture automation lean measuring and

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:13,810
sharing and Jaz actually added the L a

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,419
little bit later but it's this idea that

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:20,919
with these core principles we're gonna

00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:23,050
build and and service a team and DevOps

00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:24,910
as you know is mostly about a culture

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,000
and what we want to do is go from this

00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:30,250
culture of waiting time to submit

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,810
tickets and sitting in queues to

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:37,990
actually helping out in enabling people

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:40,000
so in 2013 we officially started cooker

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,919
officially started our micro services

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,930
journey and sre journey

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,610
and our releases as I mentioned where

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,310
every month and our ops models the dev

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,349
dev ops and in 2016 in dev ops days

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,349
Seattle I was now somewhere where you

00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:56,770
folks are and Nell shamera was up she's

00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:59,319
from chef and she said you know what let

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,050
go of being right and meet people where

00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:05,080
they are and I was like what I'm always

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,969
right like I had to let go and when and

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,300
she it was just he was a credible

00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:12,189
epiphany so what I try to do is take

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,710
that back to my 700 developers that

00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:16,810
concur meet them where they are in their

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,460
stack and at their level and help them

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,240
along the journey nobody's right

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:25,689
nobody's wrong well what will the future

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,219
look like so Alice Gould fuss she works

00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,919
at github now she used to work at New

00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:45,550
Relic I fast follow her she's

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:49,210
outstanding she her team's to never get

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,620
paged for the same event twice and I I

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,180
asked you to challenge that and bring

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,210
that bring that home to your guys's

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,659
organizations so building great teams

00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,580
why are we here so this is a obviously

00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:02,649
the Golden State Warriors basketball

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,349
team they're the world champions each

00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:07,419
person there has a role they all know

00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:10,539
their role but they're all committed to

00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:12,159
to playing defense and ball movement

00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:13,599
each player brings their own experience

00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,719
their own perspectives and their own

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,969
skills and they often overlap I want to

00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:21,430
do the same thing with sre and DevOps I

00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:24,759
want to build great teams of folk great

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,110
teams of people tools are nice tools

00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,349
aren't going to solve your problems for

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,870
you so what does end-to-end mean if

00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:33,849
we're if we're telling our 700-plus

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,680
developers to own their code in

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,449
production what exactly does that mean

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,640
it means different things to everybody

00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:41,620
right well these are the nine things

00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,360
that it means that concur design code

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,750
build test secure package release

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,970
configure and run so we try to find out

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,310
ways to make it easy for our developers

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,899
to do those but we couldn't do it

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,329
without the people the commitment and

00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,850
the

00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:56,959
that we have we have executive buy-in we

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,379
have a VP of DevOps

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,660
all the way up to mirror our engineering

00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:04,549
organization I have mentioned before we

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,829
believe in a growth mindset the king

00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:10,339
people can be coached that they can be

00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:13,489
encouraged to do better following an

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:16,220
agile operations where most folks here

00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:18,079
are familiar with agile but the the last

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,610
two or the middle two are the one I want

00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,850
to mention so blameless culture that's

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,379
so hard a lot of failures occur and many

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,689
of you folks know this because someone

00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:28,549
made a change someone made a mistake and

00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:30,470
if you have the kind of culture that

00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:32,809
empowers people to let you know of that

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,429
change it'll save you a lot of time and

00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:36,619
looking for it

00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:39,529
so blameless culture is big welcome

00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:42,470
failure that concur our busiest days are

00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:44,059
on Mondays everybody is home on the

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,249
weekends they submit their expense

00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:49,999
reports and they come Monday morning

00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:51,889
everybody wants their money so we on

00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:53,839
Mondays you know we say the production

00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:56,540
is often on fire and it's how we handle

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,869
those situations and ultimately it

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,399
doesn't work without a work/life balance

00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:03,379
so culture is not a toolset right

00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,509
there's no amount of talks that's gonna

00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:07,279
fix the culture in your organization

00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:08,689
right you need to come up with those

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,980
things that you can bring back to your

00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:14,029
organization that provide the

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:15,199
transparency to get things done and it's

00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:17,989
not a piece of software you can

00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:21,350
subscribe to so you need to cultivate a

00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:22,879
great culture and this is one of my

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,399
lessons from last year that I took away

00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:28,100
and clearly standing before you today

00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,230
very humbly it's it's amazing sre is a

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,829
global team sport we couldn't do it

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:36,559
without each other I have a prod team

00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:39,559
were roughly like 12 to 13 hours apart

00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:42,199
when they roll off at night we roll on

00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,819
in the morning and it is a global team

00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:47,389
sport oftentimes when we're handling

00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:49,939
let's say a p1 or a customer issue we'll

00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:52,009
start in Europe and then as that we roll

00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:54,410
two American hours it'll it'll it'll

00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:55,939
roll to our team but we're really trying

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,089
to improve that communication in that

00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:00,739
global team sport we're also trying to

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,329
you know we're trying to fight pager

00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:02,899
fatigue and all these other things and

00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,459
when you

00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,139
have when you have these distributed

00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:09,860
teams it allows you to take advantage of

00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:13,670
that so what matters it's different for

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,709
everybody how we are managing it is

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,990
where our true north is the Net Promoter

00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,850
Score if you're not familiar with it

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,499
that's a essentially customer

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,230
satisfaction of how you're perceived in

00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:26,809
the in the market and it's a number that

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,300
is published and we drive - so it's all

00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:30,860
about service and how we handle it and

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,379
especially during let's say a

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,929
priority-one incident or crisis response

00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:37,910
it's not just resolving the issue in

00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:40,279
restoring service as fast as you can

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,679
it's providing the assurance that this

00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,110
is what happened you were affected you

00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:47,959
were not affected and timely you know

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,269
updating folks one of the other things

00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,360
we focus on is codifying it that's

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,860
really hard we have New Relic monitoring

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,720
and a lot of the monitoring can be

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,269
sucked through the GUI but we can also

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,429
we can also codify the alerts and put

00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:03,350
them in what's called the nurple query

00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,749
language it allows us to check that in

00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,389
and we won't have necessarily the the

00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:09,769
it'll be managed in code and the one

00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:11,149
thing we know about managing things in

00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,860
code is that's the one thing that's

00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,839
handed off from one person to another

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,149
person to another person in organization

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,569
we can't guarantee that Docs and wiki's

00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:22,639
will be there but the code will be there

00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:24,709
and probably this last part this little

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,290
one here see ICD and employee happiness

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,689
what do I mean by that so continuous

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,249
integration and continuous delivery

00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:33,110
doesn't just make it faster to ship

00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:33,709
features for your developers and your

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,899
PMS

00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:38,379
it also improves your happiness like we

00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,730
want to get to a fully CI CD

00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:42,439
orchestration so that we don't have

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,290
those Saturday deployments we don't have

00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:46,939
that model ethic downtime and the other

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,850
thing that we're focusing on is Minimum

00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:52,189
Viable ops we call that F ker batteries

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,600
included it's essentially the idea that

00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,879
if you're gonna give some developers

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,379
some operational tools you also give

00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:59,480
them the necessary baselines to be

00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:01,179
successful with those tools and I'll

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,459
talk a little bit about that and then

00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:07,040
automate pretty much everything that's

00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:08,540
pretty standard so what do our tool sets

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,660
look like I didn't list them all

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,519
I just so what do our tool sets look

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,560
like I didn't list them all we have

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,529
obviously our source controls

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,380
Hubb were heavily reliance on pager duty

00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:23,090
and I mean you'd like to do that jurors

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,360
are our primary bug tracking and

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:28,880
workflow software but how many people

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,200
who are in there with chat ops here it's

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,480
a whole awesome

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,220
so for the folks that don't know it's

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,410
we're bringing operational information

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,770
into the room where you already are in

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:42,200
our case it's slack we have we have all

00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,310
sorts of ops info flowing into different

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,870
channels within slack and we have

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,970
different responses based on what we're

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,160
seeing we have outside in monitoring

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:52,700
through dot-com monitor and we could

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,589
also use New Relic synthetics so we

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,260
primarily have two types of data at

00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:59,540
concur for the SRE team we have the APM

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,300
or the New Relic data and then we have

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,770
the wrong data that we have to keep

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,850
track of and then for the logging we use

00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:11,210
the elk stack so measuring the measuring

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:14,360
the customer experience I love this

00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:16,839
quote the gal pictured to the right is a

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,080
charity major she runs a honeycomb

00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,710
monitoring

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,839
I shouldn't say honeycomb in in in the

00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,980
valley so she she wore this shirt the

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,510
other day and she took a picture of

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,910
nines doll matter of customers aren't

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,970
happy have you guys heard that before

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:34,280
think about it like we're we're at our

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,500
SLA is 99 five and we managed to that

00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,910
you know pretty well but do any of those

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,710
numbers matter if our customers are

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,720
angry they're not happy with how they're

00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,600
being changed how we're informing them

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,220
and so and the one thing charity she

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,450
actually visited our coffee ops in

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,220
Seattle and she came up and she said

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,290
think about what you're doing with

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,680
monitoring she said you've been

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,540
monitoring for 20 years right you have

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,490
you have a problem you do your root

00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,190
cause analysis and you create a couple

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,709
new monitors and then you create a

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,209
couple more monitors and then the amount

00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:06,950
of fatigue that goes on in the

00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:09,950
maintenance with that makes it very

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,450
difficult to manage so she actually says

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,480
if you're gonna if you're gonna look for

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,360
things look look towards observability

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,300
what is going on in production

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,800
specifically as it relates to latency

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,839
requests for second errors in saturation

00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,220
if you looked at those four key areas

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,709
sure you're gonna be logging all the

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,209
other statistics but you're not looking

00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,160
for

00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:31,720
keen lights on a dashboard you're

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,749
looking for how performance how

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:38,499
production is performing the other thing

00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:41,290
she she talks a lot about is is the need

00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:42,309
for having scripts that that go both

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,170
ways to production

00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,879
you don't just deployed a production and

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,230
it's a one shot to the moon you need to

00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,999
make sure that there's rollback

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:54,040
capabilities so you can roll forward and

00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:56,499
roll back that's that's pretty key so

00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,929
Minimum Viable ops to the right I have a

00:15:56,499 --> 00:16:02,050
little animated gif that was created by

00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:04,059
an intern on our team Brittany it's the

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,220
idea that you need batteries included

00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:09,040
what the toys you get in order for them

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,199
to work in our case our developers are

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,660
the ones receiving the toys and we're

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,240
helping them measure those these are for

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,249
sample counters the apdex disk CPU and

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,929
memory and we're helping them load up

00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:23,439
with each new micro service that turns

00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:25,869
up so the the critical thing is is we

00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:28,149
have our chat ops operation with our new

00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:30,850
relic monitoring pager duty and slack

00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,769
integration all in one place and all

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,189
informing us of how is production

00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:38,559
behaving obviously the I mentioned us

00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:41,829
before the the only single source of

00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:45,369
truth is that code and we we do what we

00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:46,869
can to codify the alerts this this is

00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:48,339
probably my favorite slide I think it's

00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:51,399
all about sharing and welcoming new

00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:53,199
ideas from the field in the 90s and the

00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,999
2000s when you think you when you go

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,619
into work at Microsoft and you'd go oh I

00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:57,249
got this you'd shut the door to your

00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:58,959
office

00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:01,929
how many people have offices here you

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,970
know as opposed to open desk so today

00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:05,409
the culture is very different we can't

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,209
do it without folks in the field we

00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:09,610
can't do it without your stories of how

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:10,929
it works in production for you and then

00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,480
take that back to your team

00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:15,760
I do think local meetups matter that

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,250
picture right there is uh our coffee ops

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,649
group and why said we meet every other

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,079
Friday for about an hour and a half and

00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:25,240
I know that there's also a DevOps group

00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,640
here in Israel and I think they're

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,809
having a meeting tomorrow night if you

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,990
guys get a chance to make it there's

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:33,309
gonna be about 125 Automator it's there

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,500
so cut and then obviously conferences

00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:38,770
yeah you guys are here you know that

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,740
makes sense okay I'm gonna lose a few

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:43,400
people here

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,850
how many people are on Twitter okay

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,620
there's a good portion okay

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:50,900
Twitter is a data source full of

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,900
valuable data buy a lot of knowledge

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,730
knowledge subject matter experts I

00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,520
picked out four of the folks that I

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:02,330
follow Alice Kelsey Hightower Jesse

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:05,420
Robbins and Jeff Smith and I created a

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,860
list of Automator 'he's essentially 900

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,290
Automator 'he's around the globe many of

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,790
the folks that are on twitter here i try

00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,820
to make sure that they're on it and the

00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,770
idea is is that I'm constantly learning

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,290
from the field and bringing it back

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,600
bringing it back home now I'm not

00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,460
suggesting you load up Twitter and you

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,020
sit on an all day and shared gibbie's

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,720
that's not what I'm talking about I'm

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,520
talking about you set it up and you have

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,140
a service let's say nuzzle or some other

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,540
third-party service that looks at your

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,429
your network and says what is your net

00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,200
we're talking about and then it sends me

00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:37,970
an email every day that says what

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,059
they're talking about it's easy to level

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,520
up or stay ahead on things the thing I

00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:46,250
like about Kelsey Hightower he's the COO

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,400
Burt has anybody seen Kelsey speak okay

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,710
all right okay cool so he makes it

00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,170
accessible for everybody to understand

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,179
what he's doing and he's a big advocate

00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,130
you don't necessarily have to be the

00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:58,730
world's most renowned expert to give a

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,900
talk

00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:04,460
I mean I'm speaking to you today so

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,880
Jesse Robbins he's the original master

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:11,330
of disaster at Amazon he doesn't tweet a

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,480
whole lot he's probably most famous for

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,990
his picture of his fireman outfit at

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,820
work at Amazon you know fighting fires

00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,740
so anyway if you go to that list that

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,750
list is available make sure it's HTTP

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,160
and you can actually see the nine

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,510
hundred people that are on there it's a

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,370
it's a shared Twitter list and if you

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:32,929
want to be on there DM me you don't want

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:35,360
to be on there DM me so so takeaways

00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:37,250
well I hope you're gonna walk away well

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,600
one if you want a copy of the deck it's

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,800
right there so the first thing is what

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,240
you guys are doing already which is

00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,860
showing up that's the hardest part

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,010
making the commitment actually being

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,809
there and attitude does matter people

00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,280
want to work with other people that they

00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:52,920
enjoy working with that's not a new

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,080
concept

00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,380
so you know your attitude does matter

00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,570
the team we try to push team first we're

00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,610
not looking for those rock stars or the

00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,340
ones that need to to be in full control

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:08,460
we want to employ a bunch of folks that

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:11,250
are that are able to do any of the tasks

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,560
and we have roles that we can define and

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,270
we want to learn from failure with a

00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,860
capacity to continue learning but the

00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,830
last thing I really want to I want to

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,430
mention on the takeaway is to be active

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,290
out there

00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,630
I'm not saying Twitter is your thing or

00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:27,870
LinkedIn or github but those are the

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,730
best ways to social so excuse me those

00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,560
are the best ways to show social proof

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:36,590
of what you're doing and share it

00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:38,900
amongst your your fellow automakers so I

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,730
really think I've done enough talking

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,040
this is my contact information I'd love

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,080
to I'd love to hear from you and also if

00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:51,060
you had any questions I'd love to take

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,530
time to do some Q&A yeah so that's a

00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,480
difficult issue so the question is is

00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:57,720
how do you convince management that it's

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,310
worth doing so I kind of cheated I

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,440
didn't have to do that I can occur can

00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,840
that that fight was fought for me before

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,520
I got there the idea is that we have

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,260
that executive sponsorship all the way

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,580
up through let's say a VP of engineering

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:13,410
or maybe even a specified VP of DevOps

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,000
if you don't have that authority and

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,620
you're looking to move towards an SRT

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,300
model I would obviously read the Google

00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,000
SRT tenants make sure that you feel good

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:23,370
and then what ways can you show value

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,930
back to your or one of the ways that the

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,270
site reliability engineering team would

00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:29,670
concur does is 50% of our time is spent

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,500
coding and improving software and

00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,630
automation and 50% of the time is

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,150
research troubleshooting and some

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,430
tickets so we look for key areas of

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,590
opportunity to automate such as that

00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:43,020
batteries included and what we do is we

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:47,810
show the value by instead of having to

00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:50,490
create 700 for each developer these

00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:52,800
integrated chat operations we have it

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:55,980
set up at the beginning and it shows a

00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,040
benefit all the way throughout I think

00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,690
time-saving automation and then

00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,610
automating so that failure doesn't occur

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,500
you know to the extent that you you

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,180
could but that's that's a tricky one

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,460
it's

00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:14,720
it's not easy that's a great question

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:17,750
yes question about what you said that if

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,140
you're aiming to do embedded it right

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:24,370
it's for anything in that model you will

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,860
have develops people embedded in

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:30,550
development teams or whatever I'm asking

00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:34,940
because we're undergoing a similar

00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:39,020
process in opening an important port and

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:40,250
are you've not aiming to eliminate spend

00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,520
your life they might seem completely

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:46,370
over no no not a kicker right I think

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,290
we're a little bit behind so I think the

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,180
that Google is probably doing the the

00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,760
most forward-thinking they actually have

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,980
an embedded model with charge back so it

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,360
it's a service right i sorry that they

00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,520
sign up for and so that there's a

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,210
certain cost with that we're not at that

00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,580
model right now we're we're essentially

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:07,760
advisers of tool sets and practices and

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:10,280
we're moving towards sitting embedded

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,530
with different groups as they need it

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,780
but it'll be it'll be over time it's not

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,820
and we won't look to dissolve the team

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,710
immediately we will probably be moving

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,080
more folks into site reliability

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:25,550
engineering as the the paradigm gets

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:28,160
more mature less you when you talk about

00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:37,700
batteries included almost not one or two

00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:42,530
things that can you repeat to close oh

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:44,150
yes so this so we can automate we can

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,710
automate a variety things but what's

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,260
there one particular thing that we can

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,580
automate that paid dividends forward and

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,400
I think it was the slack integration

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,410
with page or duty for us page or Duty is

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,270
our source of truth when we get paged we

00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,380
know it we're not getting notified be a

00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,390
customer or an email

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,340
it comes from page or duty having that

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,120
integration built into our apps as we

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,870
spin them up

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,120
it is super key without that it just it

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,070
just made it just made it too

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,390
complicated for other other engineering

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,210
but other groups to come up to speed

00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:17,120
with where we are and being able to have

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,340
that chat ops architecture in the room

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,710
that you're talking about

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,870
is is everything to our groups that's a

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,010
great question

00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:27,299
well thank you guys you guys have been

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,299
