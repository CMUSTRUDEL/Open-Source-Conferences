Description: 
	What is this Scylla thing we've been hearing about? why write yet another database? Well, there are a lot of great databases out there, but none quite like this one. Scylla is a database built for modern hardware, achieving extreme performance and at the same time being operator friendly and scalable. Did I mention it's open source as well?
