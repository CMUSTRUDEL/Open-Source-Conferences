Title: Vonage: Conversing with Machines: Tips for Creating Meaningful Voice Interactions, Noam Mor | Commun
Publication date: 2020-12-29
Playlist: Community Summit TLV - Sponsor Track
Description: 
	Voice is one of the first capabilities we acquire as newborns, and one of the last we lose before we leave this world. Voice communication is the fastest, most natural and efficient way to convey an idea, so why is it so hard for machines to understand the human language?
During this five minute talk, I'll share several tips that will help drive engagement when designing virtual assistant conversations, without ever compromising on experience..

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,239
to be

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,120
a super quick talk a little bit

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,399
different than

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,399
than other talks being provided here

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,399
what i do i'm a conversation designer

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,800
which is basically working on voice

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,600
interfaces or voice ui

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,399
and i design human to chatbot

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
interactions

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,800
some sort on the voice channel um so

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,800
i'm here to talk about

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,090
conversation design obviously this is

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
what i do so

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,520
[Music]

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,880
yeah i want to give you some some tips

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,000
for creating meaningful voice

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,640
interactions

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,240
um are you able to see my screen yeah we

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,240
see your screen and i'm going to drop

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,119
off and leave you with the stage so

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,159
go ahead mom thank you very much karen

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,240
so

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,720
voice right that's like the easiest way

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,600
or the most prominent way for us to

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,479
convey ideas thoughts and actually get

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,079
stuff done

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,600
that's the easiest way for us to

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,320
communicate with one another

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,720
but only in recent years we were able to

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,880
do so with machines or with computers

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,640
right so up until now we're able to

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,759
speak with one another but not so much

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,960
with machines

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,360
so recently there's a big

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,119
conversational ai boom right everyone

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
wants to jump on the wagon create the

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,799
best platform

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,560
ever to design conversations um the drag

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,759
and drop interfaces

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,640
and i feel like for a lot of developers

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,200
this would be a really amazing addition

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,759
to their

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,520
toolkit basically of abilities on how to

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,440
create meaningful conversations and when

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,720
i say meaningful conversations i mean

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,040
creating something that will actually

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,080
drive values either to businesses

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,360
or just to end users we have alexa

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,319
skills and siri

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,120
and contact centers that are using

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,520
automation

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,720
or voice automation so this is what i do

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,160
and i'm here to talk

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,680
a little bit about that so three

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,440
key things that i wanted to cover today

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
so the first one is

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,800
before you start a project you should

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,560
actually know your users

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,160
and what i mean know your users you need

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,400
to use a unique tone

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,920
language and catch phrases for each and

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,760
one of them individually

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,599
you need to give them the feeling that

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,200
they're not conversing with a bot

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,840
basically but actually sticking with the

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,200
human so i got three examples here we

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,480
have avi she's 54

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,640
danny he's 19 and sippy she's 84. each

00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,840
and one of each one of them has their

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,519
own attributes

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,280
and when i design a conversation i would

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,879
like to address each and one of them a

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,400
little bit differently just to speak in

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,720
their own language kind of like

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,599
conversing with a human right so for avi

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,200
i would go with

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,120
i can help you with that one moment

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,840
please for danny i would go with sure

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,040
thing boss

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,879
i'll get it in a sec and for tipi

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,159
no problem at all i'll go ahead and

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,760
fetch that for you

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,000
so once again you need to create a

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,040
unique tone and address

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,799
the user in the correct language second

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,959
part is when i am designing

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,319
a conversation where i'm writing a bot

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,959
basically a script

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,360
then we need to keep two things in mind

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,200
one

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,560
obviously we all know that content

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,440
content uh

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,159
content is king sorry uh but context is

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,400
the queen

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,760
so we need to keep both of them in mind

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,159
when we design a conversation

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,760
so we need to get stuff done by driving

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,519
the shortest way to action

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,799
i'm not talking about creating long and

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,000
complicated flows

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,120
people would just usually tend to

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,080
um want to get what they need to do as

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,519
soon as possible

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,840
so for this example a caller calls in

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,560
a clinic let's say we welcome them and

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
we also

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,840
because we have the number and we can

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
identify them we can

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,439
identify them by a name so i would say

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,599
welcome to astrid clinic

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,880
jerry for example this is our caller are

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,040
you calling about your upcoming

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,400
appointment with dr levi so i already

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,600
have the data

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,919
pulled from salesforce or any other crm

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,720
and actually drive the shortest way to

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,960
action

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,080
so they may say i need to reschedule my

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,000
appointment do you have something

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,479
available on the 23rd so i need to

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
understand that 23rd refers to december

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,759
right because this is the current time

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,759
so when i'm saying context that's

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,280
exactly what i mean so december 23rd 10

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,720
a.m does that work that's just one

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,280
example

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,919
one uh one important thing to also keep

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
in mind is

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,960
you need to avoid loops and keep the

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,400
conversation going so this is especially

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,919
about context

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,360
a caller may say i'm calling to check

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,400
the status of my order it's been two

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,479
weeks already

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,680
the virtual agent will say what is your

00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,919
order number please

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,440
and it will expect a number right or

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,199
serial number something like that

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,800
but the caller may also say something

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,960
like where can i find it

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
i need to understand that it refers to

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,960
the order number

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,400
and also i shouldn't expect just to get

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,080
a number i should also expect to get

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,800
those type of responses as well

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,440
and address it accordingly and the third

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,320
part

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,880
uh we need to fall back gracefully we

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,880
still

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,320
uh we'll still have conversation that we

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
are unable to understand what a user

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,960
want

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,000
due to you know lack of training or

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,479
something like that

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but please please please try to avoid

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,600
those type of sentences

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,759
i'm not sure i understand can you please

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,280
rephrase can you please repeat that

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,960
please rephrase your questions so i'll

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
be able to understand which is basically

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,000
the worst

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,520
i'm not going to give you one magic

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,240
sentence

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
because this is

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,840
whoops looks like we're having some

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,840
technical difficulties

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:04,840
uh no i'm just dropped off

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,479
um let's give it a moment and see if he

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,400
returns

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:19,360
and if not i guess we will be

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:19,360
