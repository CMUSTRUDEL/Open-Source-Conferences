00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:16,619
20:19 wow that came quick feels like

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,119
yesterday that 2018 was just here I'm

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,869
gonna start just give you a bit of

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,730
important information today and then

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,750
we're gonna get started with opening

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,599
words in keynote etc etc so this year we

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,180
decided to do devops days Tel Aviv

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,860
themed as back to fundamentals because

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,700
this was really important to us we felt

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,829
that this was something that we wanted

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,120
to tackle but we want to tell you a

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,290
little bit about what's the big idea so

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,110
I'd like to invite my co-organizer

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,010
Michael Aronson a no new co organizer so

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,090
put your hands together for this one

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,940
thanks all for joining us tonight

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,590
today I'm actually quite excited to be

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,149
here I've been in DevOps day surfing

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,300
since 2014

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,280
since the first devil days in Israel and

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:02,309
every year I think I studied a lot but

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,320
for for path day for the past years and

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,920
including the previous were spoked about

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:12,920
a system revolt I think we drifted a bit

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:17,100
too mostly tools and and community while

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,490
the basic the basic ideas I think we're

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,520
trying to emphasize this year is how the

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,530
systems work behind so many of us

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,020
probably using code tools like

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:33,960
kubernetes Nomad console etc but none of

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,720
us so most of us today don't really know

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,060
how the things work behind how those

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,460
things built on which concept they are

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,030
using and how they can improve our day

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,909
to day life and this year we tried to

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,759
build a set of talks that gives you a

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,860
good background to those things so for

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,290
example we brought many good speakers

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,149
about and forum inside like Chaminade

00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,250
they're gonna talk about the cap theorem

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,409
we also have thought polina they're

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,990
gonna speak about while monitoring sucks

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,810
and we have a lot of amazing talks that

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:10,410
are gonna give you another view another

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,220
another set of ideas of how we implement

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,980
our systems of how we work

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,560
on our staff and how essentially to be a

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,230
better operation and software engineer

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,600
and I really hope that this year after

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,030
those two days including the amazing

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,550
workshops we have and be amazing talks

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:32,720
we have you're gonna have a better gasps

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:35,090
better ideas of how things on behind and

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,970
give it that I want to thank sharone

what is this

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,789
right so many of you know the podcast

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:46,110
but who here knows the podcast three

00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:49,229
people ok so so first of all who wants

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,979
to win a free Nintendo switch totally

00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:55,320
awesome right yeah we all do so this

00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,930
actually has the least work you would

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,870
ever have to do to win a free Nintendo

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,599
switch we all know these cool facts

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,460
these like nifty things that happened

00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,770
that are actually verifiable all these

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,539
things they're like these cool stories

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,320
that we tell when we're drunk or when

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:16,800
we're stupid what you have to do is just

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,699
show up here at 3 p.m. and tell us

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,320
things that we don't know that we can a

00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:25,800
verify on the internet we'll have a real

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,629
time factor be it needs to be funny or

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,809
entertaining in some

00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:33,149
it needs to be demonstrably true okay

00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:35,999
that's it that's it

00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:36,649
so yeah Robert Barron won that one the

00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:39,240
last one

00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:41,249
unfortunately I lied him and he did not

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,809
get in Tendo switch but this time we

00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:45,959
actually got a sponsor who we actually

00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:48,749
paid for it the Mogu and I will actually

00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,759
show you the Nintendo 64 you go on so we

00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:56,550
know I'm not lying

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:59,699
awesome John next open spaces open

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,529
spaces devops days tradition it's one of

00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,459
the most important pillars of DevOps

00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:09,050
days open spaces is our way to enable

00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:13,759
you to learn from your peers this is a

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,759
new tool of trying I hope that well

00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,869
we're self organizing it's an

00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:21,209
unconference where we suggest topics

00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:23,909
that we want to talk about and then they

00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,979
vote it up and then we split into small

00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:27,629
groups to talk about these topics and

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,459
work them out with our peers this is a

00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:31,889
very very meaningful part of DevOps days

00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:34,830
it helps us to learn to grow to learn

00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:37,709
new things there's the law of mobility

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,149
which means that if you're not if the

00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,830
topic isn't exactly about what you were

00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:42,599
hoping you can go to the next group

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,629
learn from the next group you can stand

00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:47,369
and listen or you can participate the

00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:49,079
idea is just take something really

00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:50,789
meaningful from the people that are here

00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,339
and to learn from your peers so please

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:56,369
do suggest talks please to suggest

00:07:53,339 --> 00:08:01,949
options and vote up on them and those

00:07:56,369 --> 00:08:03,539
who suggest the the open space we it's

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,969
optional but we would hope you would be

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,589
able to also kind of lead it and be the

00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:10,110
person who actually kind of moderates

00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:12,360
the session it's not required but it's a

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,559
so if you want to do that please leave

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,269
your name as well there's a place to

00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,649
leave your name as the person who will

00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:18,479
leave lead the session and then you can

00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:20,699
also vote up on the different options we

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,519
hope this thing will work if not we'll

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:26,069
do it the old-school way with post-its

00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:27,930
so that's open spaces big thanks to our

00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:28,979

sati on a on an ignite and allowed to

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,340
leave on an ignite ok office hours is

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,140
something to try it's a little bit

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,000
informal we're not like it's not

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,680
required but we have folks here from

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,450
abroad like we said and if they if you

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,910
guys want to meet them we have between

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,220
the first coffee break at 11:40 it's

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,830

there's a room with the food and the

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,420
chill-out zone and the on-call hours um

00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,830
they're probably gonna drift in and out

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,090
of there but if you want to catch them

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,240
face to face and talk to them a little

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,250
bit that might be a good place to do it

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,780
we're hopeful that I you know learn from

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,850
them also they came from far and it's a

00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,350
good opportunity to speak to them

00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,390
there's also non call area that's

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,400
sponsored by big panda this year I got

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,690
that one from DevOps days again it's a

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,060
really good idea there's a really quiet

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,670
area in the corner of that room with a

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,380
charging station and some snacks if you

duty now you have where to sit and

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,930
handle it so definitely take advantage

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,970

fun too and that's sponsored by ABS fire

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,750
a code of conduct this is probably the

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,870
most important thing we want everyone to

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,570

immediately and we will handle it we

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:49,890
have ejected people from the event due

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,160
to misconduct so this is something we in

00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,140
for

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,520
it's not just something we say there is

00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,460

important to us so please also respect

spottings to the stage do you open the

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:34,650
day and bite you and tell you why DevOps

00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:37,710
is awesome so thank you spotted ok so hi

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:40,860
everybody I'm Jackie dick i'm solutions

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:43,350
architect it's Pauline and today I'm

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,420
gonna talk about how the audience can

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,710
help you automate cross reduction and

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,460
basically optimize all your cloud

00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:55,320
infrastructure so let's start few words

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,950
about the audience we founded like five

00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:03,330
years ago raised more than 50 million

00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:08,010
dollars and hire more than 170 employees

00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:10,740
in five offices worldwide and more than

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:16,110
1,000 customers and we basically started

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:18,630
like working with AWS on web workload

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:22,230
giving optimization and simplification

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:24,780
of running on spot instances immediately

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,120
after that we understood that we need to

00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:29,730
take it to the next level and going and

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,560
support more more cloud providers and

00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,110
then containers came around and we

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,270
needed to support them as well giving

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:42,750
performance and visibility across all

00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:44,900
many different work and not just spot

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,670
instances Azure name pronounced your

00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,460
computer complete cloud optimization

00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:53,430
platform and we have different products

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,800
to support that for those of you that

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,810
work with us knows elastico which has

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,750
which are is our cluster management

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:04,050
entity around spot giving us LA and one

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,149
more than up to 90 percent discount

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,089
we have ocean of solutions for

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:11,250
containers eco 4ri management manage

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:15,180
instances from stateful were closed on

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,610
spot instances and a brand-new product

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:21,899
which is cloud analyzer with give you

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:24,420
the ability to analyze give it give you

00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:28,050
a holistic view on all of your cloud

00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:32,610
span and call for actions to optimize

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:36,600
your cloud these are some of our

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:38,220
customers some view from here let's talk

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,990
about the elastic opha lassika Vista

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,380
cluster stated the cluster management

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:46,230
entity rano spot instances gives you the

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,540
optimization and simplification for

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:53,100
those of you to try work with spot it's

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:56,720
not something that is very easy and we

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,730
give a platform for that we use

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,339
prediction and data that we collect from

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,630
all of our customers instances that we

00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:09,000
spread across many Edwards regions and

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:11,010
GCP and Azure as well and we give every

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,220
spot market the scoring and by the by

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:16,440
this current we know which instance in

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,110
which in which instance type need to be

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,079
provision at any given time this coming

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,450
is updated in real time by the data that

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:30,000
we collect and data that we have from

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:32,100
previous and by that we are able to get

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,100
out to eighty and ninety percent

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:38,220
discount testimony one of one of our

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:42,600
customers that uses in production and

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:46,529
get this amount of savings next product

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:50,040
to me it's my most exciting product is

00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:52,050
ocean which gives basically managed all

00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,540
the infrastructure of your kubernetes

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,850
environment without you need to deal

00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,240
with auto scaling infrastructure ever

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:03,199
again we integrate with your cluster we

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,930
develop an auto scalar that integrate

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,480
with the metadata that you have on your

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,880
pod requirements and by that we know

00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,250
which instance need to be provisioned in

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,410
which region in which availability zones

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,000
which will they treat with every

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,000
restriction that you have

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,680
and we support multiple instance type of

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,160
course we run them on spot to give you

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:29,520
this 80 up to 80% discount and we

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,990
integrate with any kubernetes engine

00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:39,120
either SAS or host self-hosted and of

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:41,220
course SES as well and Ticketmaster one

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,430
of the biggest customers that loves

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:48,210
working with ocean without them needed

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:52,050
to log in to see how many introduction

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:55,970
kubernetes working out they have iko iko

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:59,750
is we launched eco like three months ago

00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:03,120
this is the Orion management product and

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:06,420
some of you manager right some of you

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,780
don't for those you know we are tech

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,060
guys we don't want to deal with finance

00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:15,930
cause it's tough and we usually either

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:18,360
bite once and forget about it or we have

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:22,350
a team that need to team monitor and

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:26,970
then iterate all all on all the use

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:30,590
usage of this Arai so by using eco we

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:33,240
automate all the purchasing selling of

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:36,810
both arise and of course we support

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:44,960
savings plans of AWS announced like

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:49,320
month ago yeah and as I said our last

00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:52,680
product most recent product it's a spot

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,810

double currently it's support AWS but we

are in progress to support GCP and Azure

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:09,689
as well and as you can see here we

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,280
support many different AWS account we

timeframe and how much you can save and

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,829
optimize the ROC load on the different

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:29,490
account we also have trends and events

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:31,510

the s3 like six thousand times a day and

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,880
then we have a spike like a network and

buy this too so we eat our own dog food

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:50,830
so this will save us time and money and

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:53,410
the most important thing for us is not

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:56,410
just giving you the visibility is a call

00:17:53,410 --> 00:18:00,370
