00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,440
what can we learn from the biggest

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:13,530
automation company in the world you

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,800
might think that you know them we all

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,740
use their products and we all love their

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,949
products and they don't have a single

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:29,300
repo in the Reg a tap account can you

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,300
guess the name of the company as well

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,880
that's right

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:38,520
McDonald's everything in McDonough's is

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,710
well planned they actually used load of

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,590
scalable reliable and performant

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,390
large-scale system patterns and they

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,840
even dealing with the biggest trade-off

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:52,460
that we all know for our day-to-day job

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,809
for example latency versus throughput

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,789
McDonough's is aiming for the maximum

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,680
throughput with an acceptable latency

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,350
which which basically means that

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,270
mcdonald's ran a lot of benchmarks in

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,930
order to get the finest timing for each

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,090
meal they serve they serve millions of

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,930
customer per day with an average of 5

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,930
minutes per customer

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,009
consistency patterns everything in

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,960
McDonald's kitchen has to be cooked at

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,180
the exact same time and temperature and

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,430
there is a strong consistency between

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,340
the different branches all over the

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,470
globe and I can promise you that after

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,470
enough requests you will get the Mayo

00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:37,770
load-balancing McDonald's actually use

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,659
load of layers of load balancing for

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,150
example here you can see an application

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,040
load balancer which helped McDonough's

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,200
to reduce the amount of calls to the

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,630
counters and distribute the requests

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,119
evenly between the different counters in

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,570
the branch

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,329
they even try to create a transport

00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,429
layer a load balancer but they didn't

00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:05,950
manage to get over the collision in the

00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:05,950
network micro-services because

00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:15,709
McDonald's actually built their entire

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,349
company based on this micro service

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,299
architecture as you can see the burger

00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:23,510
is talking to the buns with a with a

00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:25,310
service mesh and they actually created

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,069
the first orchestration system before

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,400
kubernetes was cool for those of you

00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:32,930
don't know this scene is a took from the

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,340
founder movie which is a highly

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:40,849
recommended multi-threading McDonald's

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,950
is using different instance types to

00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:46,160
cook the meal for example here you can

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:49,989
see a 16 core employee which can cook

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,690
the food simultaneously back pressure

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:55,940
with meals of customer per day

00:02:52,690 --> 00:03:01,600
McDonald's has to use some kind of back

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:04,400
pressure and queueing systems cashing

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,799
McDowell's do use cash as you can see

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,209
your french fries is being cashed and

00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,980
the oil has been cashed and Ike and

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,930
actually the oil is LRU cache become a

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:20,150
sec because I can promise you that they

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:22,639
won't change the oil indexing we all

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,700
know the big famous Big Mac index which

00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,980
affect our entire economy for those of

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,930
you who don't know that what is the Big

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,440
Mac index it's basically a way to

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:36,889
measure the purchasing power between two

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,780
currencies and if you don't believe me

00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:40,819
take a look on this stack of a flow

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,130
survey from last year where you can see

00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:46,900
the amount of big mass Big Macs that you

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:50,480
can buy with an average salary in Israel

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,430
hyper growth McDonald's didn't start

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,400
with billions of branches all over the

00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,590
world they actually started with a t1

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,290
micro branch and this guy

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,599
Ray Kroc managed to bring the program in

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,680
turn hyper growth situation where the

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,599
head with

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:11,540
where they had to scale up their

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:14,689
branches into X 1 e 32 accel branches so

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:17,630
next time you want a heist a high

00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:19,459
scalable and available service just get

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:24,720
a Big Mac thank you

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:29,859
[Applause]

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,859
