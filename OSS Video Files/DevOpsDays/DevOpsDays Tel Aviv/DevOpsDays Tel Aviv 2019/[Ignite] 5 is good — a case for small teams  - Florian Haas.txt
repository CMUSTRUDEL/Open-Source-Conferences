a meeting most of you people here for

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,340
the first time today but it's probably

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,349
safe for me is for me to assume that one

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,599
of the following two things is true for

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,539
all of us here you either work for a

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,130
manager or you are a manager and for

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,590
some of us both of those things might be

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,750
true simultaneously and I hope we agree

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,880
that there's five things that are the

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,769
responsibilities of any manager there's

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,890
certainly my expectation of any manager

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:34,110
including of myself I want to care about

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,180
the people that are working with me I

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,399
want to know where they are in their

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,070
contribution to our product or service I

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,690
want to act as an interface to other

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,910
groups and teams to the other managers

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,320
at my level I want to be accountable and

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,149
responsible for what we do as a group

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,550
and I want to ensure that we deliver

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,710
that which we build on time on budget

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,930
and making a good contribution to our

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,760
business and a little while back I ran a

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,230
little Twitter poll asking if these are

00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,850
the things that managers ought to be

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,789
doing and it was no disagreement that

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,159
they were then how many people should we

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,260
be doing it with and the results were

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,729
not exactly surprising they reflected

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,070
what's more or less the conventional

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,780
wisdom in our industry which is that the

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,090
general expectation is that the manager

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,210
ought to be capable of doing this with a

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,479
team size of up to ten people and I'll

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,490
humbly submit that this is wrong if you

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,799
and this is me talking to those of you

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,590
who are managers think that you can

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,409
fulfill these five responsibilities for

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,860
more than five people that's not going

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,460
to happen

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,590
five is the limit because if we agree

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,450
that these five responsibilities exist

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,579
and if we agree that they're important

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,829
that we want to take them seriously then

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,740
every single person for whose work we

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,890
hold responsibility is going to account

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,350
for about 20% of our own working time if

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,350
I run the team of three people and

00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,030
include a that is excluding myself then

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,520
about 20% of my time is going to

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,860
fulfilling these responsibilities for

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,360
those people and only 40% of my own

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,429
working time is going to be available

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,709
for my own contribution to our product

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,260
or service by the time I get to five I'm

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,650
a full-time manager I'm making no

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,959
to the other the rest of the business

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,840
anymore this is purely my my only

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,150
contribution now surely a lot of you are

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,189
going to say I can do more I can manage

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,750
more people and yes absolutely you can

00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:30,569
there are plenty of managers out there

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,730
that do manage more than five people my

00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,709
point though is that you can't do that

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,440
without compromising those

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,379
responsibilities to the team because as

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,480
managers it's our job to give our team's

00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,099
objectives and guardrails and then get

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,470
out of the way and let them succeed and

00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,000
there is very little that depresses

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,239
people's motivation and productivity

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,400
more than us standing between them and

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,560
their objectives which we by the way set

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,299
for them usually and that's how we then

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,400
end up with things like daily stand-ups

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,840
because that's the only way that you can

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,420
still keep track of how your people

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,190
operate because you can't keep a handle

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,139
on things anymore just by watching them

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,840
do their thing and let me tell you a

00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,569
little secret daily stand-ups tend to be

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,790
as much like spy managers as they are

00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,859
disliked by engineers and if you think

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,989
you're doing your people a favor by

00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,760
having daily stand-ups you'll have to

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,919
think again because most likely that's a

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,019
favor that you're doing yourself likely

00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,180
to their disadvantage you will also have

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,160
to use those daily stand-ups for gauging

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,019
how they're feeling are they

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,549
churning along at peak productivity or

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,690
are they scraping the bottom of their of

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,489
their personal barrel

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,040
are they crushing it or is it crushing

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:41,599
them do you know with six people seven

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,879
ten are you really sure and furthermore

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,620
having a large team also loses you the

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,389
ability to understand in detail

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,190
everything that your team does not just

00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:51,510
their actions and decisions but also the

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,760
options that they looked at and

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,709
discarded and went with a different one

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,470
but that understanding is a crucial

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,659
prerequisite for us to be able to act as

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,819
an interface to other groups if we fail

00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,440
our people at this then that means that

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,480
they're gonna have to coordinate with

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,430
other people in other at their level in

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,500
other teams and that's not their job

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,959
it's our job to be that interface and

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,229
furthermore in a technical leadership

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,430
role we don't have the option of not

00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:20,220
understanding things staying on top of

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,320
things technically is part of what we do

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,960
hand waving isn't in our job description

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,850
and there may well be many things that

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,740
we don't understand from the get-go

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,710
and that's fine because we have a highly

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,690
capable an expert team to explain things

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:39,150
to us and then make an informed decision

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:41,970
and from all of the above it follows

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,280
that with a large team size it becomes

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,930
really really hard to take full

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,370
accountability and responsibility for

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,500
everything that the team does

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,150
particularly when things go south but

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,250
that's the very definition of a person

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,800
in charge we absorb blame for ourselves

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,750
and we pass on credit to the team and we

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,560
want to be able and you want to be able

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:04,470
to do that confidently and on a daily

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,690
basis and without putting your Health's

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,540
your sanity your family or your career

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,280
on the line and let's not do that

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,130
five is fine let's have small teams

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,720
thank you

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:21,859
[Applause]

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,859
