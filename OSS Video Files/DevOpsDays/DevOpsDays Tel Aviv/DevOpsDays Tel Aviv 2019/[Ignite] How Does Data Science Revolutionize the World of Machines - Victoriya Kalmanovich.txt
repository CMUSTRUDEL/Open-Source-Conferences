00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,370
hi everyone I'm Vicki I'm a computer

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,990
engineer and today I'm going to talk to

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,219
you about how data science revolutionist

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,320
is the world of predictive maintenance

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,000
so what is predictive maintenance

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,859
predictive maintenance is the science of

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,910
knowing exactly when a machine is going

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,439
to break or an engine when I first

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,600
started working on this project I had

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,660
nothing to do with engines or machines

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,119
or god forbid maintenance so I had a lot

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,369
to learn and the first thing I decided

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,380
to learn among a lot of other things is

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,510
how maintenance is performed in the Navy

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,239
and in other places that rely on big

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,980
machines so the first thing you do when

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,770
you do maintenance is preventive

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,989
maintenance we all have cars right when

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,550
I when I need to take my car to the shop

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,469
I know that every 20 thousand kilometers

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,820
I have to go to the shop and the guys at

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,550
the shop they go over a set of actions

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,980
and they're supposed to prevent any

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,420
faults from happening but we all

00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,460
remember this one time where we get to

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,859
stock on the way to a really important

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,600
meeting and we couldn't make it so

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,659
that's when breakdown maintenance comes

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,100
in handy breakdown maintenance means we

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,510
couldn't prevent the fault so now we

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,200
have to find a fix for the fault that's

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,030
already happened so when it comes to

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,710
cars it's not such such a big deal

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,590
because you know we'll have to take the

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,540
bus for a week or you know miss a few

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,150
meetings but when it comes to ships it's

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,770
a little more serious than that

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,630
because when a ship can't perform its

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,030
missions then other ships will have to

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,520
perform its missions for it and then we

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,560
have to find we have to find spare parts

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,380
in order to fix the problems within the

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,909
ship and when we get the the spare parts

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,320
then we have a lot of technicians that

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,570
we have to shift from whatever it is

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,240
they're doing in order to fix this fault

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,740
so which one big mess so preventive

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,479
maintenance doesn't prevent all types of

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,610
faults and breakdown maintenance is just

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,899
the worst case scenario that's when the

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,610
world decided to work on something

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,530
called predictive maintenance and

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,939
predictive Magnus is just as it sounds

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,700
it's supposed to predict faults before

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,079
they happen and like many amazing things

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,219
that have happened in the world the

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,719
field of predictive maintenance began

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,950
somewhere in the beginning of the 90s in

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,879
NASA a bunch of mechanical engineers

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,810
were sitting around the table and

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,190
yelling at each other that they're

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,500
losing money over maintenance

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,380
maintenance routines and the way

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,720
NASA did it and many other and many

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,490
other companies that rely on mechanical

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,980
engineering in the world did it was

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,750
using physical models which means you

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,310
have to have a really really strong

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,770
domain expertise in mechanical

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,780
engineering you have to know exactly how

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,980
the engine behaves and you have to know

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,530
exactly how it changes its behavior

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,880
according to any type of scenario that's

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,810
how you build a good enough rule-based

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,840
model but we're all software ninjas here

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,720
and we know that machine learning can

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,459
maybe help with that and you're right a

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,080
lot of the a lot of companies in the

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,690
world have have seen this market and

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,580
decided to to pull through and the way

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,560
they do it is going moving from

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,290
rule-based algorithms to rul based

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,060
algorithms which means we're trying to

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,989
predict the remaining useful life time

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,739
of the machine using machine learning so

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,500
it sounds like a straightforward

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,910
regression problem right but but but

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,980
it's not because in predictive

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:17,010
maintenance a salve Airy serious problem

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,670
of class imbalance we have a lot of data

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:23,060
regarding very healthy and good engine

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,459
data and a lot lot less data on

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,019
degrading engines or faulty engines just

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,019
like clique prediction problems if you

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,120
know them in advertising you have a lot

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,630
of people who don't press the ads and a

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,390
lot lot less people who do the second

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,160
thing is that we can't just go and

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,650
scrape the web if we want more data into

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,930
our data sets we have to have actual

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,820
sensors that sit on actual engines in

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,549
order to scrape in in order to get more

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,380
data so there are a lot of ways to gain

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:53,940
more data we can maybe take the car

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,829
every 40,000 kilometers to the shop

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,650
instead of every 20,000 kilometers and

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:01,170
that way we can win some free free

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,090
faulty engines data and the last thing

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,799
that we have to keep in mind is that we

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,530
always want to make our models as

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,820
accurate as possible but in predictive

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,410
maintenance projects it's really

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,870
important that we leave the lab as soon

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,440
as possible and test our models on

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,359
real-world scenarios when I was a

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,280
teenager I always used to take my

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,890
parents car and I was really really

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,979
scared to get stuck somewhere and they

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,330
didn't have a Tesla unfortunately but

00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:29,370
today if I were today

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,419
it would really really help me a lot if

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,060
I would take the car and know exactly

00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:35,669
the mechanical state of everything it

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,349
would really have made me calmer so it's

00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:38,370
not something I have to dream about it's

00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:39,660
not something of the future is something

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,830
that is happening right now

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,569
predictive maintenance is happening

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,870
right now and it's the most important

00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:48,509
aspect of a worldwide revolution called

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,620
industry 4.0 and these projects have

00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,419
predictive maintenance they're super

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,620
cool and I invite you all to come and do

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,630
predictive maintenance method with me

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,060
thank you

00:04:53,630 --> 00:05:03,199
[Applause]
