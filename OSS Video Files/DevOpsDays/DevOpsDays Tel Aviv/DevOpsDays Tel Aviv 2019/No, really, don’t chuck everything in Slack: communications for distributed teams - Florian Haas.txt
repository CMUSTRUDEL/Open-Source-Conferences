Title: No, really, donâ€™t chuck everything in Slack: communications for distributed teams - Florian Haas
Publication date: 2020-01-13
Playlist: DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2019
Description: 
	This is a personal story. It does not claim to be rooted in statistical analysis or scientific rigour, and the evidence presented is anecdotal. But it might be insightful to anyone joining, leaving, or interacting with a remote team.

From 2011 to 2017, I ran a company that had no office. Everyone worked from home, and apart from an annual one-week face to face meeting, all our communications were remote. In 2017, I sold my company and integrated my team into a company that had previously been working exclusively out of a single office. As one would expect, the integration was not without friction (they never are), but what emerged from the experience was a better understanding of the challenges that come with a mixed office/remote work environment, and some rules to address them. In this talk, I'll cover:

* Typical misconceptions that remoties have about office-workers, and vice versa

* Using the right tools for the right type of communications: interactive chat, email, wiki, issue trackers, Kanban boards

* Timezones, and communications around scheduling

* The 5-paragraph format, a simple tool I habitually use to make sure everyone is on the same page

* Follow-up and follow-through, and how to make sure neither you, nor your team, nor your boss loses sight of what needs doing.

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,559
this talk is about communications in

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,840
distributed teams and you might be

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:18,410
wondering why am I talking about that or

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:21,000
rather why am i talking about that so I

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,279
have to admit that at this stage I'm

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,140
getting to the age were and when I when

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,359
I go to a conference I tend to raise the

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,990
age average rather than lower it with my

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,570
presence

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:35,880
so I turned 40 this year I've been an IT

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:38,820
four oh thank you I've I've been I've

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,620
been in IT for about 19 years and out of

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,680
which 18 were full-time and out of that

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,719
I've worked in four successive companies

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,500
all of which worked out of offices for

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,980
11 years

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,260
then I founded and ran a completely

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,510
distributed company for six years and

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,730
now for a little over two years I've

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,530
been running a distributed team that is

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,840
a business unit of a company that has

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,640
existed for 15 years and throughout that

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,350
time has only ever worked from a single

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,170
office so that's all sort of interesting

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,360
things and I think I might have seen and

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,220
I have been made aware of some of the

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,890
rather interesting challenges that come

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,130
with this but I would like to state one

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,780
thing upfront this isn't science

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,330
nothing of what I'm talking about is

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,729
steeped in any kind of scientific rigor

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,310
I present anecdotes rather than evidence

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,860
I might be mistaken correlation for

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,790
causation or the other way around

00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,100
everything that I'm talking about is

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,689
solely based on my personal experience

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,450
and the experience of others that I have

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,700
talked to or watched or read and

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,740
everything that I see here ok this is in

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,390
Israel so this is obvious everything

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,750
that I say here is subject to debate and

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,280
rebuttal or you can simply have a

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,460
different opinion that's cool too but

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,920
it's definitely not science now with all

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,380
of that said let me attempt to give a

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,780
definition of a distributed team

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,270
according to my own understanding a

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,540
distributed team is a professional group

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,810
whose members do not rely on physical

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,610
proximity in order to routinely

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,709
collaborate productively now I

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,920
understand that this is clearly not an

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,230
eye

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,420
deal definition not least because it

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,849
defines something by a negative and also

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,489
an outside factor it basically defines a

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:26,130
distributed team by what it does not

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,540
need in order to exist into function but

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,430
it's the best definition I've been able

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,470
to come up with and I do want to

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,090
highlight there's two key words in there

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,880
the first one is professional I'm

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,560
talking about teams that work toward a

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,000
professional goal which doesn't

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,370
necessarily mean that they all work for

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,440
the same company they could be working

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,940
in different companies but collaborating

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,260
on a joint project that is what

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,060
frequently happens in open source

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,100
software projects but the important

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,170
thing is they're not doing their hobby

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,600
or pursuing their hobby they're doing

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,209
their job and the second one that's

00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,060
important is routinely I'm talking about

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,130
teams that habitually work in a

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,350
distributed fashion and I'm not talking

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,170
about the work that goes on in say an

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,519
office-based team when just one person

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,819
is having their occasional work from

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,130
home day and it's important to

00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,260
understand that this lack of proximity

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,810
that I'm talking about here is not only

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,989
related to where people are it's not

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,739
only spatial its temporal as well

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:28,980
because working in a team that is

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,840
distributed means working asynchronously

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,970
this is equivalent if your team is

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,850
distributed it's equivalent to saying

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,739
that it works in a synchronous fashion

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,840
which is to say people will work on

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,790
things in parallel and a capable

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,320
distributed team will have just as few

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,170
synchronization points as absolutely

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,430
necessary and the reason for this is not

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,049
just that you might be working in

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,900
different time zones which may very well

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,040
be true but also the fact that everyone

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,870
on the team is going to have their own

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,760
daily routine they're gonna have

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,920
individual times when they are most

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,750
productive and if you run a team like

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,790
that you will not attempt to synchronize

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,880
those because doing so would mean

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,890
setting the entire team up for failure

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,660
now it's important to acknowledge and

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,079
understand that this doesn't come for

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,970
free and it doesn't fall in our lap

00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,000
because people aren't born with the

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,100
ability to work in a distributed team

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,109
humans function best in groups that

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,090
collaborate in close proximity to one

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,520
another that's what's been working for

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,780
us for two million years and it's only

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,030
very recently that

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,120
technology has started us started to

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,340
enable us to override that to a certain

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,500
extent which gives us other benefits

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,320
like we can work from home companies

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,240
have the benefit that we can hire people

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
who are residing pretty much anywhere

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,139
just as long as they have internet

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,669
connectivity and that means that we now

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,770
can work in teams

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,540
despite being potentially continental or

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,630
planetary distances away from each other

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,990
but we do have to acquire the skills to

00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,530
do that

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,180
and if we fail to do so that has a

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,950
rather grave disadvantage and the

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,020
advantage is that absolutely nothing has

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,200
as dire and impact on productivity as

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,570
poor communications I realize this is a

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,940
truism this applies to both distributed

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,600
at non distributed teams if you have bad

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,910
communications that's a surefire way to

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,780
wreck any project blow any budget fail

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,780
any objective note importantly the

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,639
reverse isn't true so having good

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,240
communications does not guarantee

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,760
success but bad communications does

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,750
guarantee failure and here's one thing

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,270
to start with in a distributed team a

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,830
capable distributed team habitually

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,110
externalizes information information is

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,750
generally far less useful when it's only

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,690
stored in one person's head as opposed

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,510
to be accessible in a shared system that

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,760
everyone can use and trusts and if you

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,070
take important information out of your

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,530
own head and you store it in a medium

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,630
that allows others to easily find and

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,479
also contextualize it that I think is a

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,310
pretty obvious win for everyone and

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,289
we're all tech people so we typically

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,780
have multiple facilities to do this

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:13,680
multiple facilities to externalize and

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:16,500
share and access information at our

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,710
disposal so let's see how those compare

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,840
a distributed team will have Beachley

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,539
use multiple modes of communication and

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,870
it will rely mostly on those that make

00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:29,669
sharing finding and very importantly

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,500
contextualizing information easy and it

00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:34,600
will avoid those that make it difficult

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,090
and I want to say that in many teams

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,550
whether they're distributed or not using

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:43,930
chat as a default mode of communication

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:46,000
is kind of becoming the norm and I want

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,470
to say that with an important exception

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,770
that I'm gonna get to at the near the

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,950
end of the talk this using chat

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,590
excessively is not a symptom of having a

00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,750
particularly dynamic or efficient team I

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,240
posit it's rather the opposite

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,670
it's a symptom of a particularly bad

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,980
kind of laziness note I say laziness not

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:09,040
malice I'm not insinuating that people

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,720
are doing this - despite you but it's a

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,910
it's a bad kind of laziness it's an

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,090
attempt to communicate quickly and

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,860
easily for yourself while in reality

00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,130
you're making things harder for everyone

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:24,220
including yourself and that's not great

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:27,040
because while sharing information in a

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,810
chat is very easy it's also a

00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,630
fire-and-forget mode of communication

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:34,390
chat makes it very difficult to find and

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,510
contextualize information after the fact

00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:39,910
if you've ever attempted to scour a busy

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:42,220
se slack archive for a discussion on a

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,560
specific topic that you only remember to

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,229
have happened a few months ago or a few

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,919
weeks ago you're probably with me on

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:53,350
this one it's exceedingly difficult to

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,419
read a slack discussion in context that

00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,540
is to say to put it in relation to other

00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:00,610
discussions on the same topic which may

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,460
have happened days or weeks earlier or

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,530
later so you're gonna have to you're

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,630
gonna have to imagine a smiley face for

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,270
chat share and a frowny face for chat

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,950
contextualize okay I hope this is fine

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:19,120
on your phones or on your laptops if

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:21,880
you're following along and so chat good

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,130
for sharing mediocre for finding things

00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,280
really terrible for contextualizing

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:29,020
information email makes it easy to share

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,430
information with a person or group from

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,169
the get-go but it makes it quite

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,740
difficult to loop people into an ongoing

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:38,099
discussion after the fact so email is

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,719
basically mediocre for all of those

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:43,180
finding information and email is just as

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,620
hard as with a chat and it's marginally

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,240
better but not by much at

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,970
contextualizing information

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,940
because you do get proper threading a

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:55,209
wiki and an issue tracker in contrast

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:58,480
both make it very very easy to share

00:08:55,209 --> 00:09:00,160
find and contextualize information so

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,750
the wiki and the issue tracker in the

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,820
original actually have smiley faces

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,770
everywhere and I should perhaps mention

00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,170
that a wiki in this context is just a

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,480
shorthand for any facility that allows

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,100
you to collaboratively edit long form

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,350
documents online that can be an actual

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,810
wiki like a media wiki but can also be

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,850
something like confluence Brian as

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,190
keynote mentioned shared Google Docs all

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,320
of that collaboratively edit long form

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,899
documents online likewise an issue

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,430
tracker can mean request tracker OTRS

00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:31,510
JIRA Tyga bugzilla

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:36,330
whatever works video calls video calls

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:41,680
are they can you can share information

00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:43,570
reasonably well but it doesn't scale at

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,540
all you can't reasonably have more than

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,830
five or so people in a video call and

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,330
sharing the recording the unedited

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,500
recording of a full video calls just

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,500
pointless because nobody ever watches

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,779
that so really what you want to do is

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,670
you want to make your wiki and your

00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:59,230
issue tracker your default mode of

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,770
communications and then use the other

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,600
ones sparingly this isn't meant to be

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,860
shorthand for don't use them as I'm

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,529
going to get to in a second but

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,270
basically defaulting to something like a

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,070
collaborative wiki and an issue tracker

00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,810
as your primary mode of communications

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,779
in a distributed asynchronous team

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,079
generally tends to be a good idea so

00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:23,170
let's talk about text chat briefly and I

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,750
put text chat up there principally

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,070
because usually today that frequently

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,240
means slack but what I'm talking about

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,029
it's not limited to slack it also

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,230
applies to IRC matter most riot whatever

00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:37,209
you choose to use is text chat

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,060
universally useful nope

00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:42,760
is it universally bad not bad either

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,430
because there's a very specific type of

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,770
situation in which text chat is a very

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:50,500
good thing you want to use interactive

00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:53,350
chat for the kind of communication that

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,209
requires immediate and interactive

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,790
mutual feedback from two or more

00:10:55,209 --> 00:11:00,220
participants that's not the case

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,470
chat tends to not be a good idea

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,060
what that means is that the only thing

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,280
that chat is actually good for is

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,860
communication that is required to be

00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,550
synchronous and in the distributed team

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,530
a synchronicity is the norm so that's

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,540
why using interactive chat /

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,460
communications needs to be an

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,950
exceptional event for a distributed team

00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,080
because if it said a regular occurrence

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:26,050
you're actually trying to synchronize a

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,330
distributed team and take away its key

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,270
advantage and that's quite likely to

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:33,160
make everyone on the team miserable for

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,010
any interaction that does not require

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,430
feedback that is both intermediate both

00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:42,450
interactive and immediate you're usually

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,340
far better off with an email a wiki and

00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:51,430
shared wiki page or a comment on an

00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:53,740
issue tracker direct messages that is to

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:57,270
say chat messages that you don't send

00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:00,490
over a shared channel they're useful

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,770
precisely when one clearly delineated

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,780
confluence of event events occurs which

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,490
is you want immediate feedback from the

00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,990
other person you need mutual

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,610
back-and-forth with the other person and

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,970
you don't want others to follow the

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:15,670
conversation it's obvious that this

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:19,000
combination is perfectly valid you may

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,740
have these situations you want to chat

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,330
or talk about something interactively

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,910
with a con with a colleague and you want

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,790
it to be confidential that's fine but it

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,170
should be increasingly rare if you just

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,610
want a private exchange of ideas with

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,370
someone then an encrypted email will be

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,740
fine if you want to work on something

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,660
together with one person before you

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,460
share it with others then having

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,620
restricted view permissions initially on

00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:45,610
a wiki page or issue tracker ticket work

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,310
just fine and so on I posit that if you

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:51,040
don't need confident confidentiality but

00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,330
you do need interactive and immediate

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,280
feedback so basically you're talking

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,380
about something and you want to talk

00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,940
with just one person but not because

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,500
it's inherently confidential it is

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,270
really likely that eventually you're

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,470
gonna want to pull other opinions and

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,350
bring other people into the conversation

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,370
than you won't so that means you can

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,320
just use a shared channel from the

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,570
get-go because that way it's far easier

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,550
for others to follow the conversation

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,800
if they choose to and they might be able

00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,800
to point out say an incorrect assumption

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,839
that one of you has before you all end

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,560
up at chasing a red herring which would

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,170
be a bad thing

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,149
pinging someone in a chat is exactly

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,290
like walking up to a person interrupting

00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:31,319
what they're doing tapping them on the

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,670
shoulder and asking them a question and

00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:35,350
it doesn't matter whether it's your

00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,120
intention or not they will feel

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,630
compelled the compelled to answer

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,310
relatively promptly the only exception

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,170
is when you've done this so often that

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,360
you've conditioned your colleagues to

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,100
ignore you if that's the case then

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,769
congratulations you have a different

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,630
problem but it means that ping means

00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:53,889
you're potentially breaking the train of

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,990
thought you yank them out of a

00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:58,240
potentially complex task force them to

00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,800
redo what they did pre interruption they

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,079
might actually commit a mistake so

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,550
pinging someone in a chat is something

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,579
that you should only do if you're aware

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,839
of this risk and you're convinced that

00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,000
whatever you're paying about is more

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,329
important which might totally happen but

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,699
don't make it the default if you

00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:17,829
absolutely want people to despise you

00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:19,510
send them naked pings and naked ping is

00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:21,399
the action of sending someone a message

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,649
consisting just of their username and

00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,889
something like ping hi hey or something

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:29,470
like that any person any person who is

00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:32,649
versed in the use of chat communications

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:36,069
will when subjected to this behavior be

00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:38,949
inclined to Flay you alive infinitely

00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:42,579
more so if it's a DM just don't do this

00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:45,160
please don't instead what you want to do

00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:47,470
is you always want to provide context

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,389
always always always don't say hey can I

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,579
ask you a question instead ask the

00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:54,040
freaking question if something isn't

00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:56,380
urgent you can add a marker like no

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,540
urgency or something like that you

00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,699
should or you know you just provide

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,160
context like in this example I hope it

00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:06,189
is self-evident why this is better than

00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,380
using naked pings but if for some reason

00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:10,720
to you or your boss or your manager it's

00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,610
not then please have them read naked

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,100
pings which is on the genome blog if you

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:17,680
google and naked pings genome you'll

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,290
find a wonderful article that's by Allen

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,829
Jackson and Mark McLaughlin called naked

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,199
pings

00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:26,949
which explains why this is a terrible

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,519
idea I'd like next to talk about video

00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:28,839
call

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,519
and really doesn't matter what

00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,869
technology we're talking about here it

00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:36,100
could be you zoom Google Hangouts

00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:38,829
bluejeans jitsi whatever there is a very

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,160
good reason to use video calls which is

00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:45,279
they give you the ability to pick up on

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:49,059
non-textual and nonverbal cues from the

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,470
call participants which is great but you

00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:53,319
should be aware that that's really the

00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,600
only good reason to use them video calls

00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:58,360
do have a significant drawback which is

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,490
that until technology progresses to the

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,139
point that we get reliable automatic

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,480
speech recognition and transcription

00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:05,980
they're really only half on the record

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,779
because hardly anyone goes to the

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,069
trouble of preparing a full transcript

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:10,809
for the meeting and if anything what

00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,889
you'll perhaps get is a summary of the

00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,480
points that were discussed in the

00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,569
dispute and the decisions that were made

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,449
or the action items pre - and so forth

00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:20,889
so even if we keep recordings of all of

00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:23,350
our video calls it's practically

00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:25,360
impossible to discern after the fact

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:28,240
what was discussed in the meeting before

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,949
actual decisions were made and it's also

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,929
practically impossible to find a

00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:34,059
specific discussion point where you only

00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:35,699
have like a vague recollection of when

00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:39,339
it was discussed in the video call

00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:41,470
whereas if you having the discussion in

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,089
any kind of text-based medium you have a

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,049
you stand a much better chance of

00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:49,720
actually finding that discussion point

00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:51,879
every video call needs an agenda that is

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,839
of course true for any meeting not just

00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:58,119
those conducted by a video call and

00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,339
every video call needs meeting notes you

00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:02,290
need notes and a summary of every

00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:05,829
meeting that you attend and you do need

00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:08,380
to circulate them if you think that a

00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:10,299
video call is in any way less work than

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,189
the other modes of communication that's

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:16,779
only when everyone's lazy and the call

00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:18,730
is therefore useless so really every

00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:20,529
meeting needs notes and a summary and

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,059
you need to circulate these notes not

00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:24,339
only with everyone who attended the

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:26,110
meeting but or the call but with

00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,630
everyone who has a need to know and you

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:30,130
could follow a format here this is just

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,100
a suggestion but it's one that works

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:36,130
well for me and my team where that

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,929
summary looks like this we state

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,340
basically the title or the purpose of

00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:41,410
the meeting when it happened who

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,510
attended a quick summary

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,760
then a discussion points and finally the

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,370
action items that were agreed to the

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,840
summary has a specific function this

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,640
should be basically an executive summary

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,400
and you put it at the very top for a

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,230
reason because what that means is you're

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,750
now circulating the meeting notes to the

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,490
people that have some sort of a

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,580
need-to-know and when they have a

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,680
summary at the top then they can that

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,560
enables them to quickly decide whether

00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,660
they should a familiarize themselves

00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,060
immediately with what was discussed and

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:17,020
then potentially respond if they have

00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:19,180
objections B they might only need to be

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,210
aware of what was decided because that

00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,160
impacts them or C they might just want

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,230
to keep in the back of their heads that

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,780
okay we had a meeting about this and

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,190
there's notes about the meeting and this

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,550
is where I can find them when I need to

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,680
refer back to them so that's a simple

00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:39,910
format for meeting notes which would

00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:42,100
usually cover all the bases I think that

00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,930
for recurring team meetings provided

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,680
they don't happen too often

00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:49,150
using video calls is a perfectly good

00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,480
opportunity to feel the pulse of your

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,310
team a distributed team has generally

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,540
few meetings because there are

00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,340
synchronization points and we've already

00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,140
discussed that we strive to minimize

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,930
those for the distributed team to be

00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:04,540
effective which by the way means the

00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,130
idea of having you know daily stand-ups

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,510
and sprint planning meetings every week

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,190
and sprint retrospective z'

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,560
every week that's actually fundamentally

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,540
incompatible with distributed teams in

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,160
my held opinions also by using scrum is

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,290
a terrible idea in distributed teams

00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,700
it's also why using scrum is a terrible

00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:25,690
idea period but that's a different story

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:27,970
I have done a rant on this on that stage

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,670
over there and it's up on YouTube if you

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,910
want to yeah don't be a scrum bag

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,650
exactly thank you

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,840
however having one meeting a week

00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,430
perhaps or maybe even one every two

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,800
weeks in a video called that is useful

00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,530
precisely for the reason I mentioned

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,060
before which is you can pick up on

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:48,730
nonverbal cues like body language and

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,410
posture facial expressions tone if

00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,030
people are stressed out or they're

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,500
generally unhappy it'll show if they're

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,940
relaxed and productive that will show

00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,790
too so for that purpose video

00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:02,830
calls are actually a pretty useful tool

00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:05,140
I want to talk about briefing people

00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,330
briefing a group of people on an

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,150
important matter and I want to propose

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:13,750
to you to use a five paragraph format

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,860
for this now interestingly enough this

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,260
is something that comes out of the

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,020
military and I believe this is actually

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:22,000
a format that the IDF does not teach so

00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,920
this might be new even for the many of

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,890
you who have served this is actually

00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,970
something that comes out in NATO in NATO

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,520
parlance this is called the five

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,920
paragraph field order and the five

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,350
proscribed paragraphs are the situation

00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,750
what's our mission what's the execution

00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,920
how are we going to achieve and

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,260
accomplish the mission

00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,520
what's logistics and command and signal

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,650
is basically how are we going to

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,050
communicate I want to state upfront that

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,790
you know despite the fact that I have

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,190
served and I'm a reserve officer I'm

00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,110
generally not a fan of applying military

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,880
thinking to civilian life because if

00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,320
we're being honest it's an organization

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,310
that's optimized for killing people and

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,410
breaking things but but in this case

00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,590
this specific case is actually something

00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:06,910
that can be very much applied to

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:09,400
professional communications in business

00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,050
with some rather minor modifications

00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,180
this is the format that I use when I

00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:15,640
need to brief my team when we embark on

00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,410
a new project or law or start working

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,140
with a new technology or something like

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:23,050
that a situation that's the position

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:26,140
that we're in and the why why we set out

00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:29,740
to do what we want to do objective is

00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:32,860
what we want to achieve our plan is how

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,840
we want to achieve it Logistics is about

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,940
the budget that we have available the

00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,550
resources that we have available in how

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,900
we intend to use them and communications

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,090
is about how we're going to be

00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,670
coordinating amongst ourselves and also

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:49,450
with others in order to achieve our goal

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:51,850
and this just gives me a a nice little

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:54,280
way of keeping track of okay did I

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,570
actually cover all my bases did I

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,340
include everything that I need to

00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,310
include in order to brief my team or

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:03,100
even people in other teams when you do

00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:04,180
this people have always questions about

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,690
what they've just been briefed about

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,429
your briefing will never be perfect

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,899
but they might not think of those

00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:11,429
questions straight away

00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:13,109
so you want to give your people time to

00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:15,659
think through what you've just briefed

00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:17,669
them on and they will definitely think

00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,109
of good questions so you always want to

00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,759
have a follow-up round at a later time

00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:22,830
that could be two hours later or the

00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,960
following day or whatever and in that

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:29,099
you want to encourage your group to come

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,649
back with questions so actually asking

00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:34,710
them asking them to be you know

00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:37,710
available for another round of questions

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:39,479
or come back to you by sometime by email

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,070
with questions is much better than to

00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:42,419
just ask are there any questions because

00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,970
the knee-jerk response to that is no

00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:46,289
it's all good and you can also use that

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,269
follow-up for a different purpose you

00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:50,519
can actually check for how your briefing

00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:52,440
came across you can gently sort of quiz

00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:53,820
people you can ask questions like okay

00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,389
by what they do we want to implement

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,710
feature X or or Joe what things are you

00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:00,419
seeing are you gonna need to coordinate

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,759
with Jane on that sort of thing because

00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,320
that also gives you feedback on the

00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:06,239
quality of your briefing because if your

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,769
team can't answer these questions then

00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:09,149
chances are you weren't as clear as you

00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:13,109
should have been and then you can

00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:15,239
improve at a later date I want to say a

00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:17,039
few words about what I like to call

00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:20,279
pinching the fire hose that you might

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:23,549
otherwise be forced to drink from when

00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:25,619
you work in a distributed team because

00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:28,139
everyone is on their own schedule and

00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:30,539
everything is asynchronous you may be

00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:32,070
dealing with in with a constant incoming

00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:33,690
stream of information which can come

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,639
from your colleagues can come from your

00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,649
reports can come from your manager can

00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:39,749
come from your customer there isn't any

00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:42,149
way to change this you cannot actually

00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:45,149
reduce that information flow but what

00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:48,029
you can do and need to do is apply your

00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:49,739
own structure to that stream and what

00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:52,229
follows what I'm gonna talk about next

00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:53,700
it's not the way to do it but a way to

00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:56,039
do it and you might find another one

00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,989
that works better for you but I will say

00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,239
this you're going to need to define and

00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:01,830
apply some structure because otherwise

00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:03,450
you're gonna just feel constantly

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,629
overwhelmed and you're at a serious risk

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,309
of burnout and the defined approach that

00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:10,679
I'm talking about is something that I

00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:12,960
personally learned from David Allen's

00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,210
book getting things done it's called the

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,830
4d approach I don't know if David Allen

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,839
actually invented that approach or

00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,549
whether someone came up with it before

00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:26,429
him but that's how I know about it

00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:29,179
and he proposes for actions that you can

00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:32,759
apply to any bit of incoming information

00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:35,369
drop means is this stuff that you need

00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:37,109
to read understand and then archive

00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:39,599
that's what you use for anything that

00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:41,549
doesn't require action on your part

00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,959
you still need to understand but you

00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:46,259
don't need to do anything other than

00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:49,349
that delegate is for things that do

00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:50,909
require action but not from you which

00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:52,559
means you want to make sure that gets to

00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:53,999
the right person and it's understood by

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,179
that person and you make a note for

00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:59,729
follow-up the firm means it needs doing

00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:02,039
and it's also you who needs to do it but

00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:03,779
it doesn't need doing immediately so you

00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,719
want to answer that into your task list

00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:08,629
and clear that from your inbox and

00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:12,149
you're gonna loop back to it later and

00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:14,609
do are the things and those are

00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:16,079
typically very few that remain after

00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:18,299
you've done all the other filtering and

00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,759
those are the ones that need to be done

00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:23,759
and they need to be done by you and they

00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:25,409
need to be done immediately and that's a

00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,659
very helpful approach it doesn't mean

00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:29,099
that you'll never be overwhelmed by the

00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:32,129
amount of information that you need to

00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:34,889
process but it will greatly reduce that

00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:37,109
risk of overwhelm and there's a few

00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:38,989
interesting rules for these ah dropping

00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:41,849
things that doesn't mean ignoring them

00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:43,320
you'll still have to read them and and

00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:44,489
understand what's in them and you're

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,099
going to be able to find them later

00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:49,649
which means you never delete things

00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,269
except spam you can throw that away but

00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:54,149
generally you only archive you never

00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:56,179
delete you archived them in a way that

00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:58,139
keeps them retrievable in the future and

00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,269
if there's something that isn't

00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,919
understandable to you you want to think

00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:04,289
it through pull an additional

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:08,029
documentation look or ask for

00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:10,259
clarification rules for delegation

00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:13,139
delegation obviously requires that there

00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:15,329
is a person you can delegate to which

00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:18,139
isn't necessarily someone who reports to

00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:20,459
you it might be someone you report to

00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:21,959
you might for example you might be asked

00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:23,549
to deal with something that in reality

00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:25,829
you have no control over but your

00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:27,710
manager does at which in which case

00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:30,149
you're gonna need to delegate upward and

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:32,070
the rules for delegation are you want to

00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:33,950
find the right person that can actually

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,019
get this task done

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,240
you want to preemptively send them all

00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:40,269
the information that you think they

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,260
might need and that you have access to

00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,750
rather than engaging in the

00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,309
back-and-forth of them always asking for

00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,990
more additional information like

00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,480
everything that you've got and that you

00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:52,690
think might be important for them in

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,789
their context just send it to them

00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:58,090
asking to acknowledge that they have

00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:00,409
received what you what they needed and

00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:03,409
then you want to make a note to follow

00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:06,230
up to see number one to see if they need

00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:08,330
anything else and also follow through by

00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,669
seeing the task to completion and I want

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,590
to re-emphasize here this should be to

00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:14,299
sort of go without saying but I want to

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,940
emphasize that if you're delegating

00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:19,820
within your own team you only ever

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,740
delegate tasks and not responsibility

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,679
like outward and upward it's always you

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,370
who remains responsible I want to say

00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:28,070
one thing

00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:30,889
you really shouldn't delegate or not

00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:33,380
even define any tasks that you're not

00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:34,820
prepared to follow through on so let me

00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,529
give you an example if you just hand

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,419
wave everyone and use encrypted email

00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,799
from now on and you're not prepared to

00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:42,049
make that work for your own email

00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:44,389
account then you might as well just

00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:46,340
leave it right that's a useless thing to

00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:48,830
to define and do if you're not prepared

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,350
to follow up but if you do proclaim a

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,179
rule or an objective or whatever and

00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:57,230
then you find yourself unable to see it

00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:59,080
true which happens and I maintain that's

00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:01,880
no sign of ineptitude of failure you

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,309
want to cloud lis and clearly rescind

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,380
that pronouncement right it's far better

00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:09,980
for you to visibly backtrack on

00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:12,440
something rather than be perceived as

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,029
someone whose statements are basically

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,779
safe to ignore right because there's not

00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:21,080
gonna be any follow-up anyway deferring

00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:22,639
simply means that because something you

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,799
need to do doesn't need doing

00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:27,289
immediately you can do it at a time that

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,820
suits your schedule so that means that

00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:32,059
you will need to add the task

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,159
immediately to some sort of queue for

00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:36,049
email I use a folder that simply named

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,809
needs reply I actually have to I have

00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:41,600
needs reply and it needs follow-up if

00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:43,610
you're on a gmail basis then you can do

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,140
this much nicer with labels and things

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:48,510
but whichever

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,580
you then want to make sure that at some

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,710
later time you go through that queue to

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,420
prioritize that would ideally be right

00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:58,140
after you're done with the do tasks

00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:00,420
we're gonna get to in a moment and you

00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,730
absolutely want to ensure that you make

00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:06,780
time to go back and actually do those

00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:10,140
priorities prioritize tasks at any time

00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:12,450
that you consider convenient and finally

00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,480
there is the do tasks so basically that

00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:18,900
stuff that I need to do and do

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,880
immediately which is I want to tell

00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,280
people that I'm doing them because I

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,720
want to be uninterrupted I generally

00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,730
want no interruptions I want to turn off

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,830
all my notifications and whatnot and

00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,080
then I actually want to plow through all

00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:35,580
the under opt undeleted under furred

00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:37,020
items until I'm actually through now the

00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,060
entirety of the talk up to this point

00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,500
has focused on professional

00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:43,050
communications right and among people

00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,090
who are unfamiliar on from experience

00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,410
with work in a distribute team it's

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,630
often except that the teams can

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,040
communicate well professionally but then

00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,720
people frequently ask okay what about

00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,420
the watercooler talks what about the

00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,630
informal discussions that happen while

00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:59,700
people are you know chatting over coffee

00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:04,050
well firstly many people who ask that

00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:07,500
come out of a company where information

00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:09,030
exchange hinges on cafeteria talk simply

00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,570
because they don't give a damn about

00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,890
externalizing information and if 90% of

00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,750
your company's knowledge is only in

00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:18,030
people's heads then you're dead without

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,020
the cafeteria pretty much but if the

00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,150
same thing never happens in a

00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,980
distributed team it really never gets

00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,170
off the ground so if you do have a team

00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,910
that's functional and productive because

00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:30,090
it eventually externalizes information

00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,740
then the absence of chitchat over coffee

00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,530
really has zero negative impact on

00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,600
information flow but you also may be

00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,600
interested in the non-work-related talk

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,470
that happens over coffee the stuff that

00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,520
simply contributes to people's

00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:46,650
relaxation and well-being and whatnot I

00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,090
hate to break this to you I know this

00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,250
might shock some people but there's

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,530
plenty of people out there who can make

00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,600
an absolutely terrific contribution to

00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,540
your company who just happen to dislike

00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,630
the social aspect of work

00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:02,100
there tend to be called introverts they

00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:04,230
might thrive when they're being left

00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,510
alone they might like having as little

00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,040
small talk as possible they might relish

00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,290
the opportunity that they have to

00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,500
socialize with their friends and family

00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:15,660
but just not with work and that's cool

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,610
but even so if you do have people that

00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,470
enjoy having an entirely informal

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,700
conversation every once in a while there

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,340
totally is room for that in a

00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:26,700
distributed team all it takes is a

00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,230
specific keyword that you agree on for a

00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:33,240
chat it could be something like this

00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:35,550
coffee break okay so basically what that

00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,660
means is I'm on a break and I'm happy to

00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,370
chat with anyone who's declined

00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,350
preferably about non-work-related things

00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,650
if that's what you group agree on agrees

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,720
on

00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:44,160
that's perfectly cool right you could

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,170
even have a dedicated channel for this

00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,790
it lathe you name it whatever a random

00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:52,140
internal or something like that right

00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:56,130
where people can just converse and talk

00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,630
about whatever right so you can totally

00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,400
do that

00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:02,640
all right as I'm about to run out of

00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,620
time I do want to mention one thing very

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,450
briefly and you're welcome to see me

00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:10,410
after about this or review the slides

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:11,700
online which is there is a I want to

00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,740
acknowledge there is a complete

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,950
antithesis to what I've just been

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,630
talking about and Robert is sitting back

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:22,350
there who's written extensively about

00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:24,480
the topic which is chat opps ok so that

00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,610
which is a completely distributed and

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,110
completely alternative a completely

00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:32,160
alternative framework for for

00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:33,900
distributed teams which as far as I know

00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,810
this is something that was coined in

00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,550
about 2013 Jessi Newlin from github did

00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,200
a talk at Ruby fuse about that at that

00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:43,160
time so that's kind of the earliest

00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,800
mention that I've seen off that of that

00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,600
and in a distributed team if it operates

00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,810
on a chat ops basis absolutely

00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,720
everything happens in a chat everything

00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:59,370
happens in an interactive text

00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,800
communication mode and what you do is in

00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:04,350
such a system that you rely heavily on

00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,820
the use of chat BOTS so for example if

00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,470
an alert lands and the channel the

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,030
discussion then yields that the proper

00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,650
fix for the problem is to run a specific

00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,930
ansible playbook

00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,940
you actually send an in chat bot command

00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:17,550
that kicks off that playbook and reports

00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:19,410
the results which is laudable because it

00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:21,630
resolves a major issue with using chat

00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:23,430
which is the scenario of something being

00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,110
discussed and then someone going away

00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:26,850
for a bit and then coming back saying

00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,830
hey I fixed it and everyone's happy but

00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,810
no one's actually learned from it right

00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:33,600
and if you make everything explicit in

00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,980
band that way then it becomes easy at

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,380
least in principle to go back to a

00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,580
previously solved problem that

00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,410
subsequently reappears and then

00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,590
basically replay the salute the the

00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:44,160
resolution the resolution so can this

00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,010
make sense

00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,770
yes absolutely definitely under what

00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:51,840
circumstances I'd say this is best

00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:54,360
suited for when your work tends to be

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,030
inherently linear with respect to some

00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,380
dimension and for example if your

00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,210
primary job is to keep a system

00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,430
operational versus the linear passage of

00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,590
time I think chat ops can actually be an

00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:07,170
excellent approach but keeping complex

00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:13,260
systems operational over time is the

00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:15,090
definition of ops ok so I think it's a

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,620
very very suitable communication mode

00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:21,600
for operation but it I personally pause

00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,310
it it's highly unlikely to be efficient

00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,860
as a generic mode of communication

00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:27,960
across distributed teams regardless of

00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,190
of what they're doing and even then I

00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,899
posit it's difficult to get right

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,610
because you're gonna have to curb

00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:34,110
channel sprawl and threading and other

00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,700
things but let's hold another talk and

00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:39,210
and probably a talk for another speaker

00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:42,480
because I don't lead an ops team okay so

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,880
with that feel free to peruse this QR

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,770
code to tweet about this talk and tell

00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,510
your friends and office hours yes okay

00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,070
thank you office hours are going to be

00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,380
over there somewhere

00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,850
I'll be there find me there thank you

00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,649
very much for your attention enjoy the

00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:58,640
rest of the day it's been great being

00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:58,640
here thanks for having me

00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,640
you

00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:07,119
