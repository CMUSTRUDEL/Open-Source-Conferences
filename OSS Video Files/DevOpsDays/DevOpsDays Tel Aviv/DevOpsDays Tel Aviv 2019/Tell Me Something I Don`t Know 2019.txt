00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:11,330
welcome to DevOps days edition of tell

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,700
me something I don't know

00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,279
and for those of you who don't know what

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,150
that is it's a concept that I blatantly

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,539
copied from a podcast and the whole idea

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,769
pretty much works like this people who

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,810
have signed up and maybe some other

00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:33,530
improvisers from the crowd will come in

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,140
and tell us things that we don't know

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:39,600
meaning these are interesting facts and

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,550
nifty things about our industry or

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,160
science or engineering or something that

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,100
sort of relevant to what we do in an

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,690
entertaining fashion then our extra

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,370
snarky judges extra snarky I said we'll

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,879
ask them very very embarrassing

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,280
questions about their facts and we have

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,489
a real-time fact checker natty Cohen who

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,280
will verify that they're not lying to us

00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:08,930
so have a big round of applause for for

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:13,049
our panel of judges what from the Mogu

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,720
week Islands up from f-fire Matthew

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:19,170
Cohen from here I'm Your Mother

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:27,360
moderator gills are no thing anyway the

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:29,880
first person up is chef ah means so haha

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,340
thank you I hope I'm the first and the

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:38,400
last one let's talk about counters

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:42,119
basically it's very easy just increment

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,140
a number but when you want to write it

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:49,530
consistently to disk you have to lock

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,280
the counter really increment and write

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:58,170
and then release for the next one to two

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:02,960
interment the counter the problem starts

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:08,090
when we get to scale yeah if you think

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:12,140
on you know like harddisks spendest take

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:16,760
10 milliseconds to just sick for forward

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:19,130
countries so you are very limited in how

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,750
many rights you can you can do if you

00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:25,340
will look about thousand concurrent

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:29,810
counters at which you get ten seconds

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:32,180
and you know if you look at YouTube

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,959
scale for example that they show you the

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:40,850
the counters your wait two days for

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:45,980
Gangnam style counted to to appear so

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:50,570
how did Google skilled counters they

00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:55,100
show them too many counters say thousand

00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:57,250
of sub counters and when they update a

00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,830
counter they pick one randomly

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,770
incremented then Assam chronically read

00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,470
all the shards sundown and send them

00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:12,050
back to the user

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:15,170
okay and that takes less than 20

00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,260
milliseconds okay first of all is this

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:21,890
true this checker is checking okay do we

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:28,519
have an extra sake question say it's

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:37,930
here okay okay do we have an extra

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:37,930
snarky question to ask him okay

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:46,390
well if you'll have to increment a

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,390
number in your bank account

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,980
have you tried to scale the counters

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,070
using blockchain dokyun kubernetes

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:58,070
together no I actually actually the the

00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,470
post is before Gangnam style I don't

00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:03,640
know if it's still hot water I don't

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,640
know if it still work in production

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:23,520
[Applause]

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:26,490
next up ivy six eight three six four so

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,140
of it uh isn't they did not call my name

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:34,169
is because they asked who you are and I

00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:38,550
am a vermin a so my fact is it's very

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:42,450
low a anyone know about dokie here

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:48,060
I guess Hey and does anyone know

00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:49,919
minecraft here yeah move aim so for some

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,640
reason unknown reason I don't think

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,240
anyone knows over uses it a token itself

00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,310
created a visualization and management

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,610
tool for token for some reason you can

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,740
actually flip a switch and remove a

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:08,870
container or delete a container okay it

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:22,110
a container on a minecraft a UI and

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:27,330
that's very useless thank you do we have

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:29,850
an answer check out so true we have

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:34,950
another picture we have a picture but

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:37,320
we're not connected so this okay the

00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:44,010
judges Fink's the story so ridiculous

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:49,710
that we don't have comments do you have

00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:51,180
kubernetes api UI in minecraft i guess

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,390
it will be a good idea I don't see why

00:05:51,180 --> 00:06:00,600
not

00:05:51,390 --> 00:06:09,539
it's just losing the same amount of okay

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:10,800
next up we have evgeny from Prato I was

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:15,950
in the audience when they shot the

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,690
Minecraft them in Barcelona so I have a

00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:21,030
personal story last week I was at the

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,120
family dinner there was this small kid

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:26,260
with

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,480
great a right act Aleph and he was very

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,150
excited playing the cyber challenge

00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,720
anybody has kids who played the cyber

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,730
challenge anyway in the cyber challenge

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,040
is kind of games like you noticed this

00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,690
game when there's a square and you need

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,760
to move the car out of the square by

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:46,930
moving all the pieces inside for example

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:51,880
or anyway it's these small games and his

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:55,930
father asked me wow what is cyber okay

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,660
what is cyber and I was very surprised

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:02,230
to know that I know the answer okay and

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,260
I told them you know cyber it comes from

00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:08,200
the science of cybernetics anybody knows

00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,580
what cybernetics is cybernetics is the

00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:14,500
science of learning how people and

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,230
systems interact not computer systems

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:21,490
any systems and they it talks about how

00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:24,460
systems are comprised of entities that

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,530
have relationships okay and the

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,990
relationships are even more important

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:32,080
than the entities now we all know that

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,020
this is a hot topic in devops system

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,190
thinking but did you also know that

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:44,770
cybernetics has its origin in a non

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:49,210
Greek word Lyn Evette anybody knows how

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:53,440
it is in Greek Lyn of it other than

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:56,260
Sharon anybody nobody knows only Sharon

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,530
knows anyway cybernetics is actually

00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:02,280
comes from the word kubernetes in Greek

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:05,020
so that's another touch point for DevOps

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,090
yeah and that's my fact that you

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:13,660
probably didn't know thank you cyber and

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:16,240
develops so basically if I use

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,850
kubernetes I have cyber but I still need

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,360
big data to sell my startup is that

00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:24,880
correct

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:28,120
I don't think big data is relevant

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,190
anymore but you do need AI today so if

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,460
you have kubernetes and you have greek

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,130
people and you have AI

00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,440
you can say that you're kind of a cyber

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,870
AI startup and that's very hot today you

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,669
can sell it as you can see stony cliff

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,860
is not hot anymore and the story was

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,950
good but I didn't hear the world okay so

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,040
I'm giving you one but I wear the docq

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,660
t-shirt but I wear I wear the t-shirt

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,870
that's going 20 it says doctor on the

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:59,460
dishes the judges get to be snarky you

00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:01,610
don't how long did he stay in the dinner

00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:05,910
before they throw you out of the room

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:08,640
after this lecture the father asked me

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,670
the question he was surprised about with

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,860
the lecture that the God is the response

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:21,630
but he asked the question so it couldn't

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:23,700
get away it was his home not tonight so

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,160
so now we all have a new interview

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,700
question just after asking for stock

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,279
engineer which way the stock rose in x86

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:36,089
we can now ask cyber engineers how to

00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:38,940
use kubernetes you can ask engineers if

00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,920
they have a cybernetics degree you know

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:49,650
why not I think that's a good idea

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:53,029
thank you tick tock okay I have a

00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:57,959
slightly less boring amazing fact

00:09:53,029 --> 00:10:01,050
apparently 5,000 people annually get

00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,240
hospitalized in the US for burnt

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,779
buttocks

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,250
the reason is believe it or not that

00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:11,610
they all try to check if their

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:15,560
flatulence is can ignite that's our

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,560
facts look at

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:39,220
yes I'm so I saw a queue right now for

00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:41,440
my upcoming ad we're trying to find this

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,260
fact on Google but Google says we have a

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,080
cancer

00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:51,340
[Laughter]

00:10:46,080 --> 00:11:03,070
also it's apparently we have nothing to

00:10:51,340 --> 00:11:04,870
comment on that conduct today you know

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:09,460
honestly I think this fact doesn't smell

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:11,320
right I have a story that I'm pretty

00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,110
confident you don't know I'm gonna have

00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,030
to twist myself into some pretzels to

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,490
relate it back to our industry but let's

00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:21,400
see how I do you have a two minute got

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,050
it all right two minutes so you've heard

00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,750
of The Wizard of Oz the movie The Wizard

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:28,030
of Oz everybody okay good so he was

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,570
written by a guy named elf frank Baum

00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:34,810
who died in 1920 but they made a movie

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,340
based on that book and there was a

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,010
character in the movie named professor

00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:42,700
Marvel who's also the wizard at the end

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,170
in Oz and when they were casting him

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,420
they wanted a costume him and they

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,670
wanted him to have a regal looking

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,560
jacket but a jacket that looked like it

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,620
was tattered because he was kind of a

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,260
hustler he was like a fake salesman kind

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,510
of guy so they went to wardrobe they

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,430
tried to put together this coat nothing

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,880
looked right they finally decided to go

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,740
to a thrift store and find a jacket they

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,220
went and found the jacket that they used

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:11,770
in the movie and during the filming the

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,220
actor looked in the pocket and in the

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:17,020
sewn into the pocket in the inscription

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:20,440
was the name el frank Baum

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,390
it was the author's jacket that who

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,400
lived in New York that somehow found its

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,890
way all the way over to Hollywood and

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,960
ended up being in the movie

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:32,650
and that is verifiable you can look it

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:35,800
up but good luck looking it up now how

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,510
it relates to our industry is you know

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,700
in DevOps as long as we have the right

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,860
systems in place we can always trace a

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,480
chain of events back to their start and

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,010
get to get into the root causes of

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,210
things that's what I'm going to say

00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:51,520
there that's some Chinese contortionist

00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:56,400
level of getting right all right

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,400
I told you what do you got for me hit me

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:10,030
it's a legend I'm moving myself good job

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,970
yeah so can we have the same coat in my

00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,150
craft alsa the why do the code can we

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,410
have it also in Minecraft yes

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,590
orchestrating containers but also like

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,150
my not telling legends which is legend

00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,360
don't take it as a fact

00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:28,090
sorry sir we'll be legendary it's very

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,340
cool but we cannot verify it oh come on

00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,960
alright I'm gonna find a verifiable link

00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,960
can I do that or is it only the judges

00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:43,210
only the judges can be sorry okay cool

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:47,650
thank you so Khilafah I hope you all

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:51,130
heard about Watson IBM's AI engine it

00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:54,820
was an edge and that compare competed

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:59,790
against other people in jeopardy the

00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:03,160
quiz show and it crushed the humans

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:07,900
practically something like 37 thousand

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:10,660
points against about 4000 and it's got

00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:16,030
mistakes and one of them was that kind

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:20,190
of interesting the category was the US

00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:24,460
cities and he got some definition and

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:29,500
and he answered Toronto Canada for a

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:32,440
u.s. city and later the Watson was

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:36,010
developed forever - and could research

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,410
even more topics like medical so if you

00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,399
want to give you cancer unless you have

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:44,019
some

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:48,170
basically it's an AIA engine that looks

00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:51,139
information by itself and can learn from

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,810
credible sources by itself and but

00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:59,420
probably geography is not a strong topic

00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:00,949
for him okay I think not other people

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,600
know but behind the story they're

00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:07,730
learning mainframe with COBOL to

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:10,699
implement that is that correct I don't

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,680
work at IBM and I don't didn't look at

00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:15,620
the github so I have no idea if they use

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:27,639
cobble and thanks again IBM for

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:27,639
sponsoring today the checker on film

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,509
[Applause]

00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:35,720
Daniela wish

00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:38,209
and so my fact is even a question to the

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:45,170
crowd into the judges how old is

00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:48,889
Nintendo company a hundred and thirty or

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:52,220
years old it actually started as a card

00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:54,949
company until 1960s very became a toy

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,139
company and then in the 70s it became

00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:59,870
the console company which we know today

00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:03,110
well it's not an unknown fact probably

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,910
because our gamers are here too but who

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,850
meets always surprising that the company

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:15,560
can success today and not become not

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:30,399
stuff from a start-up it's not

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:30,399
authorized thank you leave an unboxing

00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:41,470
hi guys so in quick raise of hands how

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:44,529
many of you ruthlessly killed ducks in

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:47,649
the 80s or 90s I mean like virtual ducks

00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:51,160
in duck hunt any what please yeah that's

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:53,769
it no a lot of young people here does

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:58,269
any of you know how the light gun works

00:16:53,769 --> 00:17:00,819
actually in the game you were shooting

00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:03,189
like pointing a gun at the TV yeah in

00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:05,169
duck hunt you are pointing a gun at the

00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:10,230
TV press the trigger and the duck will

00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:10,230
die how did it work you're the judge

00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:16,360
okay so this is something I hear a lot

00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:19,449
these colours it calculates Karla's

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:23,250
something like that but it's yeah I know

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:26,350
it's not yeah so many people think of

00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,970
things that are quite complicated the

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,480
truth is that it's a pretty simple

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,970
solution

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,460
all the Gunners inside is a photodiode

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,159
which can detect light changes and the

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,740
trigger which can send the signal to the

00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:41,470
console basically once you pull the

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,960
trigger the screen blanks for one frame

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,899
it just become completely black and then

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:51,460
there is there appears white square

00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:53,590
around the duck and then the console can

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,929
calculate calculate if you hit it or not

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,210
because of the light change from black

00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:00,760
to white if you have multiple targets

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,510
you just add you know you you flesh each

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,850
target one one at the time and that's

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,220
basically the super cool but some would

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,080
you say oh wait I will just like used to

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,520
point the gun at the at the light and

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,440
pull the trigger and all the ducks will

00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,139
die so this is a previous implementation

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,889
when all the the entire screen will

00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:24,700
flash in white but Nintendo fix it in

00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:30,309
order to get ahead of the cheaters I

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:32,889
guess yeah that's it can you implement

00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,870
this today using native this lambda sure

00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:37,270
sure it's all serve unless it's Doak

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,700
erasable and yeah you can scale it to

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,529
infinity and beyond it seems to me like

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,000
a much more interesting topic for dinner

00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:46,420
than the other guy with this cyber

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,990
[Laughter]

00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:54,310
yeah okay I'm sorry I'm pulling rank

00:18:50,990 --> 00:19:03,140
here no more darker jokes that's it

00:18:54,310 --> 00:19:06,920
thank you very much sir okay next up if

00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,840
you submit this to all sorry only it

00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:14,030
relates to software development and

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:18,470
testing apparently when they developed

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:21,830
the f16 f-16 if I'm not mistaken was one

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:24,470
of the maybe the first aircraft which

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,780
was like fly-by-wire which means you

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:31,600
weren't technically moving control

00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:34,070
planes by moving pieces of metal and

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,040
pulleys and cranks it was actually a

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,770
computer behind the scenes mapping the

00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,200
pilots movement of the joystick and

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:45,290
moving in control planes because the f16

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,230
was very aerodynamic but highly unstable

00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,840
so everything was left for the computers

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:56,240
which is basically a bad idea if you're

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:58,790
flying like Mach 2 and early on luckily

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,920
while testing they discovered this I

00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:04,700
discovered a very lethal interesting

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:08,710
fact when a test pilot was running the

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:11,920
simulator and he crossed the equator the

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:15,680
airplane turned upside down and crashed

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,110
and this is because nobody took into

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,630
account that when you cross the equator

00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:23,420
the numbers would start to be negative

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:26,540
and so they didn't accommodate for that

00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,460
so that's an interesting point to take

00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,800
next time you put on testing or and

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:35,860
think of the unlikely scenarios which

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:41,090
you crash in production first of all I

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:43,490
actually know that this is true what do

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,680
you have to say I don't have the laptop

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,330
I believe it's false because nobody does

00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,660
testing so it's an introduction

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:54,410
obviously so when you said testing it

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,630
was suspicious but other than that no

00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,430
question but just said it thank God I'm

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:03,490
not flying

00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:05,200
well no in the air actually I'd like to

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,410
point out that this is the first fact

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,200
that is actually demonstrable true

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:17,050
because it's like the pilot but I said

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:20,220
thank you for watching wait right and I

00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:23,350
believe this is last one we have florian

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,540
so Florian what is your cool pack

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,920
well my cool fact is of course a

00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,640
question because we are supposed to ask

00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:33,730
a question right a leading question so

00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,650
imagine you want to get like that super

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,240
amazing limited edition sneaker that

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,740
you've been dreaming of all your life

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:44,500
and every time you try like some bastard

00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:53,080
snaps it ahead of you and you you luck

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:58,360
out what do you do is an option there is

00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:01,180
a more peaceful option so yeah you can

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,460
hire goons exactly so you can hire

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,390
something called a sneaker bot which is

00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:09,790
a service that buy sneakers for you and

00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:15,300
also the good thing is you can pay using

00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:17,830
Bitcoin and also it runs on kubernetes

00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,560
sorry sir you are disqualified for

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:25,330
making it oh no no I didn't make a

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:27,660
docket oh yeah I'm just stating fact

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:30,640
so yeah no this is actually true so

00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:34,900
there's like an industry of like dodgy

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:38,160
characters that that hire the smallest

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:42,480
possible VMs on cloud providers and run

00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:45,130
services that like basically DDoS

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,480
websites of sneaker companies or like

00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:51,550
other limited edition merchandise like

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,150
Star Wars cooking pots or whatever else

00:22:51,550 --> 00:23:01,270
this is the this is the peaceful option

00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:05,649
yeah I mean like as opposed to shooting

00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:08,570
someone right yeah so and

00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:10,460
okay fair I mean like sure it's it's

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,289
it's certainly them less peaceful option

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,200
towards towards your friendly cloud

00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:17,480
provider because rumor has it that they

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,509
don't like this very much because these

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,549
sneaker boats obviously use up a lot of

00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:26,539
resources and don't make a lot of money

00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:28,549
so yeah don't use them but you can look

00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:30,409
them up you can buy them for like three

00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:36,440
hundred twenty-five dollars or something

00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:38,960
like that extra few judges it's tough

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,700
man like I think we still haven't left

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,320
about okay enough so I'm just gonna say

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,279
it okay and again okay

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:49,070
and yeah my question is will this solve

00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:52,609
the Middle East crisis like the world

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:55,129
peace and everything maybe not maybe it

00:23:52,609 --> 00:24:01,269
does I mean maybe you can you can hire
