Title: Rick and (post)Morty - Erik Zaadi & Daniel Korn
Publication date: 2020-01-12
Playlist: DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2019
Description: 
	Whether you’ve watched the show or not, you are probably aware of the phenomenon that is called Rick and Morty.

Though it may seem like yet another animated TV show, it actually deals with various issues and conflicts and holds some enlightening life lessons.

The show follows the adventures of a brilliant Senior Principal engineer and his Junior mentoree, as they face interesting challenges, not too far from the ones we encounter in our day to day work.

During the talk, we’ll share how binge-watching Rick and Morty taught us valuable lessons, reminded us of fundamentals already forgotten and pushed us to be better engineers by adding some crazy sauce.

[Music]

00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:11,400
hey everyone thanks for coming to our

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,200
talk Rick and post Modi everyday

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:19,170
engineering fundamentals learned from

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,560
Rick and Morty can you please just close

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,820
the door

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,439
yeah thanks so right before we begin

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,730
you're probably wondering how we ended

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,470
up giving this talk so a few months back

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,360
still energized by the talks we gave at

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,570
the vesting conference Ellie can I

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,520
notice that the Devils a is called for

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,440
papers opened we thought it would be a

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,260
great idea to have a talk together at

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,649
the same time we wanted an excuse to

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,039
re-watch Rick and Morty Eric suggested

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,370
as a joke that we submit this talk we

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,920
even wrote laughs interdimensional joy

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,699
and wisdom in the audience takeaway

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,670
section fast forward a few weeks you can

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,500
imagine our surprise and fear when we

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,240
receive the confirmation email so

00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,290
they're following 20 20 minutes are the

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,310
outcome of this joke we hope you enjoy

00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,229
here's some disclaimers

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,240
we're not Rick and Morty experts we're

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,310
just addicts all the opinions

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,170
represented here are our own and the

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,240
most important disclaimer we will not

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,930
spoil our season for in any way don't

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,630
worry so let's get to talk about who we

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,880
to our this fabulous thing here is

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,159
Daniel Korn an engineering manager a

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,840
Maccabi Tel Aviv follower a gift hunter

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,110
and a meme crafter and an absolute

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,229
phenom and everything that it is thanks

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,630
Ike the legendary Erica toddy a rare

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:49,860
combination of Swedish and Yemenite a

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:54,110
team leader a German master and the

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,110
deadpans advocate thank you

00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:02,150
so a we to work at big Panem and we have

00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,280
a large customer base who has NOx and

00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,640
basically where their eyes on production

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,590
so needless to say uptime and things

00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,220
like that are kind of religious to us

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,680
and our experience in working on scaling

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,620
problems long on-call shifts and

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,820
sleepless nights are also reflected in

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:25,100
the lessons we're gonna talk about here

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:28,790
in a show of hands who here seen Rick

00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,800
and Morty okay that's great

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,959
so for for those of you who haven't

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,390
watched the show Rick and Morty is an

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,330
American animated science fiction sitcom

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,150
that follows the misadventures of mad

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,280
cynical scientists Rick Sanchez and he

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,470
is good-hearted but fretful grandson

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,790
woody Smith they split their time

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,540
between domestic life and

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:52,730
interdimensional adventures so for those

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,010
who didn't raise their hand it's okay

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,600
but you're probably wondering if this

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:02,030
talk is even relevant for you well yes

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,640
now putting a cynicism aside we believe

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,130
that if you look that baby past the

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,050
crazy animation and bad language there's

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,420
a lot to be learned from this amazing TV

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,220
show so in this talk will cover the

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,860
engineering lessons we learn from Rick

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,480
and Morty let's try to think about Rick

00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,320
and Morty as people we meet in our day

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:26,600
to day life Rick Sanchez is a senior

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:30,200
principal AI architect he doesn't have

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,830
LinkedIn and he will not have one he is

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,900
known to be rude condescending

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,600
unapproachable and he won't speak with

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,400
anyone from HR he still writes COBOL and

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,519
he can configure kubernetes without

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,019
using any ml files no one knows how long

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,030
he's been at the company but the general

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:48,220
rule of thumb is that Rick can solve

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,100
anything

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,989
and this is Maury woody is a second year

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,850
grad student who got lucky and grabbed

00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,549
an interim position as a junior DevOps

00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:01,310
engineer Morty thinks that he's a hard

00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:03,260
worker with a lot of potential and he

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,060
recently did a docker tutorial but he

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,130
doesn't get how everybody get to be an

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,870
expert but just by doing so

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,870
I think it's time let's get on to the

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:15,170
lessons jeez thanks Eric let's start

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:18,020
with something fundamental in season 1

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,300
episode 9 the Smith family are sitting

00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,160
at the breakfast table Lake finishes

00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,590
tinkering with the robot and when that

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,740
robot comes to life Rick tells it to

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,960
pass the butter the robot then asks Rick

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:34,040
what is my purpose

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:37,040
Rick responds you pass butter the robot

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:41,060
is having an existential crisis it looks

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,460
down at its wheels and says oh my god -

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:47,180
which Rick responds yeah welcome to the

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:56,690
club pal this scene has become so iconic

00:04:47,180 --> 00:05:00,140
it is now a meme template when we

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:02,630
watched when we watch this scene it

00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,050
reminded us something fundamental the

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:08,390
very first idea of the UNIX philosophy

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,760
write programs that do one thing and do

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,640
it well if that sounds familiar

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,640
that's probably because it's practically

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,910
the definition of today's microservices

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,950
architecture but back to our fundamental

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,690
we've all been there we start with a

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,570
simple script that automates one

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:29,240
operation then as time goes by another

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,880
need arise and we almost naturally tend

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,490
to just add it to our script usually by

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,980
creating a code smell after a few more

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:41,960
iterations our code is so loosely

00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:45,350
related complexed and non maintainable

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,180
so the first takeaway from this from

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,940
this talk would be to resist the

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:55,370
temptation of having an all in one piece

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:57,800
of code thanks Eric you're welcome and

00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:02,200
write programs that do one thing and do

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,200
it well or in short thought of Dave dog

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:12,600
so in season 3 episode 6 one of the most

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,220
iconic episodes ever and the Smith

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,610
family is scheduled for a therapy

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,440
session calling Jerry ambassador force

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,570
Eric does not want to go to therapy but

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,660
he's too proud to actually admit it so

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:27,900
as an excuse he turns himself into a

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,970
pickle a Beth finds out about this and

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,100
he's very angry and she takes with her

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,289
the anti pickle potion that Rick

00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,860
prepared to return himself back normal

00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:40,830
again in the spirit of the rest of the

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:45,090
crazy show a cat shows up and pushes

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,919
Rick ethical into the sewers there in

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,110
the source Rick uses the most

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,020
unthinkable resources to overcome his

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:57,360
pickle like controlling the limbs of a

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:59,370
cockroach hmm he goes on overtaking the

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,900
body of a rat using whatever scraps you

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,570
can find in a sewer to slowly build

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,260
himself up a full-on automated weapon

00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:09,020
system and finally he gets out of the

00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,180
sewer hey Rick

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:16,260
he does it in a fashion that that's

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,470
worthy of an 80s action movie and it's

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,860
very very impressing that takes us to

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:25,830
our first segue and I forget to do this

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,979
you didn't forget it's okay that you

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,150
should start small and build up

00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:32,159
basically if you're handed a huge

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,349
feature you should break that down into

00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,849
feasible milestones that build upon each

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:37,889
other as building blocks

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:42,060
you should start small use whatever you

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:44,789
can around you and be lean a the this

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,949
episode has so much beauty in it and due

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:48,570
to the time restrictions we have in this

00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,000
presentation we can't include them all

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,180
but we'll just heal the art for you all

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,560
to say that finally Rick ended up in

00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,840
therapy as a pickle and that a takes us

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,400
to the other takeaway here if you have

00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,159
something that you're uncomfortable with

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,900
right that could be a feedback session a

00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,060
salary discussion or even a pull request

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,950
from that really really grumpy senior

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,419
you should probably just deal with it

00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,310
instead of turning yourself into a

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:21,780
pickle yeah you can take it off now

00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:24,330
great that was hot in season 1 episode 5

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,650
the Smith family asks wick for solutions

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,820
to some of them of their mundane

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:36,930
problems Rick give the family the mythix

00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:40,020
box a gadget ok thanks you promise you

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:42,000
won't do it a gadget capable of

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,350
summoning helpers named mr. meeseeks

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,510
these blue helpers exist only to solve

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,320
the task at hand and once it is solved

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,840
they disappear

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,970
Rick assures the family that the

00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,360
creatures are happy to die and warns

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,610
them to keep their tasks simple unlike

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,290
Beth and summer jerry has a simple task

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,270
he wants to get to knocks off his golf

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,680
game

00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:10,260
Joey struggles to improve in golf

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,600
despite training from his miss ik's

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,670
he's already he's ready to give up but

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,370
then his musics who can't stop existing

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,980
until he completes the task decides to

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,280
summon another mystics to help you get

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,690
where this is going it's not long before

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,850
Joey is surrounded by dozens of

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,230
frustrated mystics who starts losing

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:33,780
their sanity because they haven't lived

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:35,400
that long now if you think about it by

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,950
summoning more and more creatures

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:41,910
the Mystics chose the scale out or

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:44,220
horizontal scale strategy it basically

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,500
means that instead of making one VM or

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,630
machine bigger you create a cluster and

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,550
add more and more instances to it

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,880
it became common with the move to the

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:57,780
cloud and the microservices architecture

00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:00,360
now while it can be it has many

00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:04,500
advantages the scale of strategy comes

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,390
with a price that price is that you need

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,520
to rethink your architecture and

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,910
sometimes even make changes to your

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:16,020
source code so there are limitations

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:18,600
like network or data distribution maybe

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,880
even the application logic and so the

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,200
takeaway that we want you to have from

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,390
this episode is that you see that you

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,360
should think twice before you just scale

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,470
out it might over engineer

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,170
complex some simple solutions at some

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,390
point the mythix starts to blame each

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:44,870
other and argue over the correct

00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:45,860
solution the situation turns into us

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,930
into a brawl

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,550
the Mystics tear each other apart while

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:56,870
summoning more and more mystics to join

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:59,990
the fight so most companies have major

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:02,959
at least few major outages throughout

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,060
the year we all have them we can't

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,160
prevent all of them but we can

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,070
definitely learn from them a common way

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,920
to do that is by having post mortem

00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,140
meetings the journal idea is to bring

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,329
the team together to discuss what

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,220
happened why it happened

00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:21,410
meaning the root cause how the team

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,890
responded and how we can prevent it in

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,620
the future not such an easy task right

00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:29,839
well from our experience of countless of

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,209
outages the best way and the most

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,370
effective way doing that without any

00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:39,589
playing games is to practice blameless

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:41,779
post modems you yeah thanks Eric you

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:44,390
assume best intentions without

00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:46,459
identifying or punishing whoever screwed

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,279
up the participants don't need to worry

00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:51,199
about getting demoted or fired and the

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,089
focus is on continuous improvements

00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:54,980
decreasing the chances of ignoring

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:59,209
incidents in the future for the fear of

00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:02,329
blame and creating an open culture of

00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:04,279
learning in your next post-mortem

00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:09,199
meeting try to remind everyone in the

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:12,860
room to avoid any finger-pointing in

00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:13,910
season 1 episode 6 Maury wants to

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,630
impress the love of his life

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:20,390
so naturally he asks Rick for a love

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:23,690
potion to help him Rick talks to get a

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:27,050
quick MVP of things like vole DNA and a

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:29,810
lot of crazy stuff and hands Maury the

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,029
potion morty then asks Rick are there

00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,550
any dangers or side effects needless to

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:37,130
say Rick dismisses am condescendingly

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:40,010
and only after Marie leaves remembers

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:42,620
one very important disclaimer in if any

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,220
case this potion is exposed to the flu

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,940
all

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:49,490
we'll go down and more didn't takes this

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,200
to a flu ball a dance dedicated to

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,780
preventing the flu where people came

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,690
sick with the flu and that / turns

00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,730
people into Morty cray crazies zombies

00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,870
that love Morty and applied over him an

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,750
almost tearing apart

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,730
Rick notices this and creates another

00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,400
potion basically build on the previous

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,520
batch this time using praying mantis DNA

00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:14,510
because what the heck and this will fix

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:17,450
things for sure well if then it turned

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,580
the entire planet into mantis mutations

00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,730
that love more it so desperately as you

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,620
can see in this image a Rick in the

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,200
spirit of the rest of the show another

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,030
crazy patch is thrown together by Rick

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,000
and this time they screw up the entire

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,650
dimension turning them into

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,260
unrecognizable monsters called

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:40,310
Cronenberg's and this takes us to the

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,900
first take away for this yeah for this

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,960
episode and that is you should probably

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,760
avoid side effects whether if it's in

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,070
your infrastructure where your builds

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,930
runs jobs or whatever you're doing they

00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,420
should always be clean and sterile and

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,640
not have any side effects like a

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,500
previous database or file systems that

00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,180
fill up and the same thing with your

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,920
code right even if you're writing the

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,780
simplest function you should probably

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,270
not include that utils logger or

00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,820
whatever that might slack your smack

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:13,490
your code with unwanted side-effects

00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:14,300
like CPU where I open things after a

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,580
long night

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,590
Rick and Morty sits on the roof sees

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,930
their entire plan and Cronenberg and

00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,520
they recognize they screw things up

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,040
there's nothing they can do right now

00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,500
and that takes us to another takeaway

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,460
which is you should probably know when

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,260
to start fresh

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,870
right standing on the shoulder of giants

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,730
and you know not reinventing the wheel

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,580
it's a very good thing but if you're

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,650
building patch upon patch upon hellish

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:42,580
maintenance unmaintainable a legacy code

00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:46,870
you're probably doing it wrong

00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:49,250
this episode ends very especially

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,010
basically Rick finds an alternate

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,110
universe where this love potion was

00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,270
fixed miraculously and at the same

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,650
moment that alternate universe Rick and

00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:02,510
Morty just killed

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:03,980
so they are a or the infamous c-137

00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,960
dimensions freakin mori that we're

00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,120
following simply slips into that

00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,130
dimension buried themselves in their own

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,010
backyard and assumed their reality and

00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:15,370
the last segue for this episode is you

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:19,430
should probably know when to start fresh

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:21,530
hmm sorry if you're working at 2:00 a.m.

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,780
on a production outage and you're trying

00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:28,130
to solve things you should probably stop

00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:32,480
and think because you do mistakes right

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:35,090
there remember we talked about rick

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,640
being a senior and Moorea junior well in

00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,170
a way rick is mentoring morty throughout

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,900
their adventures right from the first

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:45,830
episode here are some of our thoughts

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:47,960
and insights about mentoring mentorship

00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:52,670
is a ride has its ups and it has its

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:55,070
downs it's a hard work not rewarding at

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,370
most times taking every ounce of your

00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:01,760
patience as a mentor you should push

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:04,190
your junior to their limits and he just

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,280
might boost their confidence and give

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,140
them a sense of accomplishment and as a

00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,180
mentor you'll be surprised how much you

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,600
can learn from juniors it's much more

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:16,190
than a different approach the first

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,400
advice it's a way of thinking that

00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:21,290
you've already forgotten

00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,960
sometimes even the smallest gesture just

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:28,910
being there for your mentee can change

00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:30,650
their entire reality so in short the

00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,690
last takeaway for this talk is mentoring

00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,250
you should be encouraged that in your

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,470
organization it will help your

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,680
organization mature it will spread the

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,870
knowledge and empower your employees so

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,370
Daniel I think it's time for a recap

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:47,140
yeah

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:50,390
you should do one thing and do it well

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,220
whenever there's a big problem start

00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,590
small and build up work with what you

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,470
got you should deal with whatever is not

00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,750
comfortable for you skate out isn't

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,430
always the answer

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,819
you should probably avoid side effects

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:07,120
preferably using immutability try to

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:09,350
always practice blameless post modems

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,170
you should know when to call it a night

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:14,350
and start fresh and the importance of

00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,660
mentoring for you and your organization

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:22,280
so Daniel how do you think it went

00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:25,430
I'm not so sure well I hope you all

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,589
enjoyed we had a blast if you have any

00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:30,350
more questions we'll be at the big Panda

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,630
booth questions about us big panda or

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,110
Rickon worry and thank you thank you

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:40,250
very much

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:45,359
[Applause]
