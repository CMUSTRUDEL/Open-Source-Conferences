Description: 
	Whether you’ve watched the show or not, you are probably aware of the phenomenon that is called Rick and Morty.

Though it may seem like yet another animated TV show, it actually deals with various issues and conflicts and holds some enlightening life lessons.

The show follows the adventures of a brilliant Senior Principal engineer and his Junior mentoree, as they face interesting challenges, not too far from the ones we encounter in our day to day work.

During the talk, we’ll share how binge-watching Rick and Morty taught us valuable lessons, reminded us of fundamentals already forgotten and pushed us to be better engineers by adding some crazy sauce.
