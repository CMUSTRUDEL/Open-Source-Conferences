Title: [Ignite] Hot Takes, Myths, & Falsehoods–Why Everyone's Wrong Abt DevOp But Me - Matty Stratton
Publication date: 2020-01-12
Playlist: DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2019
Description: 
	Everyone has an opinion about DevOps. The problem is, most people’s opinions are wrong. In this Ignite, I’ll spin through some of the more popular misconceptions about DevOps of the last year or so, and clarify them as only I know how.

Will Kubernetes save your soul? Are enterprises too stodgy for DevOps? Is immutable infrastructure even a thing? Can you devops without kitten gif’s? I’ll bust myths and take down thought-leaders with my tongue planted firmly in cheek.

00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:15,389
so unlike Gil I believe in the format of

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,830
ignite but I don't have Otto advancing

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,090
on this and so we're gonna see how well

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,279
this works

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,869
there we go cool okay anyway this is all

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,460
about hot takes myths and falsehoods are

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,359
fundamentally why everyone is wrong

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,130
about DevOps except for me and my name

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,859
is Matt strand I'm a DevOps advocate at

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,050
pager duty so basically don't believe

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,200
everything that you read on the Internet

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,520
you will find that there's quite a lot

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,920
of people have opinions on the internet

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,309
they love to share them and most of

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,989
those opinions are wrong and you know

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,520
really putting words in random order is

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,829
not thought leadership except actually

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,079
that that pretty much is exactly what

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,989
thought leadership is and what you might

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,360
find as you kind of explore the internet

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,309
and and go around that there's a lot of

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,170
common beliefs about DevOps and I'm here

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,329
to tell you that most of those common

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,799
beliefs are untrue so I'm gonna go

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,590
through some of the common myths

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,049
conceptions about DevOps and kind of

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,580
bust those myths so the first myth is

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,060
that you might hear people tell you that

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,380
DevOps is more than just tools you might

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,000
have heard this one before and

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,060
unfortunately I got to tell you that is

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,040
not true and here's why it's not true if

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,700
it was more than just tools why would we

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,740
have so many of them and there also are

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,509
a lot of tools on DevOps Twitter someone

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,250
might tell you that DevOps is more than

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,710
just automation we probably heard that

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,150
before and a lot of folks will tell you

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,049
it's more than automation and there's a

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,479
lot more to it than that

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:46,259
that's patently false and here's why

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,770
because if we look at cams a is the only

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:53,100
vowel vowels are more important than

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,720
consonants and therefore automation has

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,420
got to be the most important part of

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,369
DevOps okay someone might tell you that

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,840
kubernetes won't solve all your problems

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,549
and unfortunately that the next the the

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,270
reason why this is untrue Philips talk

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,860
always messes this joke up for me but

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,750
but anyway kubernetes came from Google

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,370
so that's clear right docker is boring

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,349
and old we

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,849
that a little bit earlier and but yeah

00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:20,180
Mille does show your commitment to

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:21,530
precision this is this this one kind of

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,120
gets messed up when Philips talk it was

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,269
before mine because he shows just how

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,340
and precise UML really is folks might

00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:31,220
tell you that if you do devops you still

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:34,190
need to have testing people will tell

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,260
you this this is also untrue because if

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:39,620
you remove the human element you remove

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:42,170
human error and if a micro-service does

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,580
only one thing it literally can't have

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,599
an error because that would mean it's

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,099
doing two things right someone will tell

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,049
you you hear this one a lot right you

00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:52,940
can't buy devops how many people have

00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:54,799
heard this myth before this is really a

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,150
big myth and here's why you might not be

00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,400
able to buy it but I sure as hell can

00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,799
sell it to you right seriously I would

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,670
love to sell you some DevOps

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:04,760
what's it gonna take to get you in a

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,709
bright and shiny new DevOps today DevOps

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,400
is not a title we've heard this one

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:11,750
before a lot and the reality of this is

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,849
nobody can tell you what titles to use

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,019
in your organization maybe your HR

00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:17,959
department can but what do they know

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,400
about DevOps and maybe people have

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,440
you've heard this myth before that you

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,510
can do DevOps on Windows people have

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,760
said this and this is just really untrue

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,540
because a key component of DevOps is a

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,170
smug sense of self-satisfaction and

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:35,090
something something about Slashdot and

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,139
finally perhaps the most egregious myth

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,139
around DevOps

00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:42,290
is it cats are more aligned with DevOps

00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:44,870
than dogs right you can't have a DevOps

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,489
talk without cat gifts in it cats or

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,769
what DevOps is really about and that's

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,930
not true because I mean come on this is

00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,180
really cute right so anyway thank you

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,799
very much my name is matt strand page ii

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,780
says you should follow me on twitter so

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,049
and that will bring us the end of the

00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,049
ignitor

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,120
you

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,539
