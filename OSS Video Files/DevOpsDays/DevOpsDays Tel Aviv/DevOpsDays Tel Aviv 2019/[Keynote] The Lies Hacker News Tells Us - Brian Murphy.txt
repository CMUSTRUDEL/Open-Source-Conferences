00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,450
so good morning everybody

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,730
I am super excited to be here to talk to

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,790
y'all this morning most especially

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,090
because it is cold and snowy in New York

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:23,100
right now so winter here in Israel is

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:25,740
proving to be a lot nicer the title of

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,960
my talk today is the lies that hacker

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,880
news tells you and I don't really mean

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,099
to pick on hacker news it's really

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,280
anywhere that the developers congregate

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,520
are slash programming Stack Overflow

00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,129
Twitter there's a tendency for us to

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,660
sort of fall in love with the new

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,149
exciting technologies that are being

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,649
talked about in these forums and that's

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,829
going to be sort of the thrust of the

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,520
conversation here but first let me talk

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,289
a little bit about myself and so at this

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,420
point I worked at a lot of different

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,219
companies doing a lot of different

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,870
things so early in my career I started

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,399
out doing consulting which was amazing

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,519
because I got to jump into a lot of

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,170
different companies and learn different

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,869
technologies and now different

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,880
businesses worked I did a start-up where

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,290
I was engineer number three managing all

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,270
the infrastructure in the API is the

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,740
startup didn't go anywhere but I learned

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:22,110
a ton and then I found myself eventually

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,110
sort of accidentally in media so I

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,390
worked for Conde Nast as they were

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,490
transforming all of their brands to

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,439
digital properties so traveller and

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,680
Vogue in The New Yorker and Vanity Fair

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,460
and all those folks and then I found

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,110
myself at the New York Times where I got

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,810
to deal with sort of large scale

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,759
engineering problems because we had

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,680
pretty sizable teams and we were dealing

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,290
with everything on the digital side of

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,780
the business as we were transitioning

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,549
over to having digital subscriptions but

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,860
also dealing with the legacy print

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,960
environment and the mainframes and

00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,700
getting data to the the printing

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,680
facilities and all of those sorts of

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,020
things and from a scale perspective

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,360
dealing with the burstiness of breaking

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,829
news right so breaking news alerts go

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,959
out and then you've got these these

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,069
massive surge is coming to your mobile

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,219
apps and you're up

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:17,819
and things like that after the New York

00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:20,609
Times then I went on a tumblr where I

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,969
got to deal with the sort of enormous

00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:25,769
scale problems of social network which

00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:27,569
is really interesting from a data

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,269
perspective and from a traffic

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,859
perspective and as a part of that right

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:36,930
I got to be part of the acquisition

00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:39,659
landscape with Yahoo and Verizon I

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,430
learned a ton if you've been paying

00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:45,000
attention that didn't go particularly

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,980
well but now tumblers found itself a new

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,530
home with the automatic folks over at

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,409
WordPress and hopefully they'll be much

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:57,049
better for them and so when I'm up to

00:02:52,409 --> 00:03:01,379
now is I'm the CTO at sea geek

00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:05,340
thank you thank you and I joined them

00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:07,709
earlier this year and as was mentioned

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,900
we've got offices all over the world at

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,849
this point and I've been finding myself

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,370
coming to Israel now to hang with the

00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,470
team up in car Bo we're gonna be moving

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,590
to the new high tech Park and bar-lev

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:22,500
this summer so continuing to grow the

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,479
team here in Israel and obligatory yes

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,040
we're hiring and and work from home is

00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:30,569
cool too so what does seeking all about

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,609
so we don't have a consumer experience

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,680
here in Israel so I'll do a quick

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,269
run-through on what the platform is all

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,280
about for those that maybe aren't

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,780
familiar the mission of the company is

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,019
to help people to experience more lives

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,299
so think concerts think sporting events

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,699
think theatre anything really involving

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,769
live entertainment is sort of in our

00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,650
wheelhouse and what we're focused on and

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,099
the platform sorta subdivides you can

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,389
think about it as as two different

00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:00,150
business lines right we sort of think

00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,159
about the consumer marketplace and so

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,400
this is this is where you go to buy

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,189
tickets right antiquing has been a very

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,310
data-driven company since its it's early

00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:12,720
days and we've launched many years ago

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,859
this thing called deal score where we

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,370
take a look at the pricing trends around

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,840
tickets and assess whether the actual

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,909
ticket that you're looking at is a good

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,780
deal or not

00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:26,639
we get into a

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,110
personalized recommendations so we've

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,550
got a pretty sizeable data science team

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,400
that's working on recommendations and

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,070
pricing and things like that we try and

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,300
do a lot to help you understand what

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,660
it's going to be like in the venue

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,480
before you get there so 2d maps and 3d

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,720
maps and panoramic views of what the

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:50,190
seating is so that ends up being super

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,770
fascinating paper tickets are basically

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,540
going away so now it's also your gateway

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,669
into the event and how you think about

00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,990
access control once you actually get

00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:02,370
there and it is a marketplace so it's

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,950
also the space where you would go to

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:10,440
resell tickets if you can no longer make

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:12,810
it to an event and so on the other side

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,979
we've got the enterprise SAS platform

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,840
and this is what the the team and Israel

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,630
has been focused on for years and years

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,360
and at this point we've got hundreds of

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,979
customers around the world and so this

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,490
the SAS platform is really the

00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:32,490
back-office software that venues are

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,460
using right so if you go to a Maccabi

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,050
Haifa or Maccabi Tel Aviv game and

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,750
you're buying tickets you're going in

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,820
that's that's powered by C key on the on

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,260
the back end and that's what they're

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,970
using in the box office and the back

00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:50,070
office and things like that I knew

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,720
nothing about ticketing before joining C

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,880
geek I think I had what I would describe

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,410
as the typical consumer experience of

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,690
you buy the tickets you complain about

00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,390
the fees you scan into the event and you

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,979
don't really think about it beyond that

00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:05,070
it's a surprisingly Byzantine

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:07,080
interesting industry which means we've

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,960
got a lot of opportunity to fix it and

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,410
make it much much much better and this

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,600
got really interesting scaling problems

00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,030
so we haven't had the pleasure of having

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,000
BTS come through one of our venues yet

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,550
but inevitably they will and you know

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,669
when you've got these massive concerts

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,830
you're dealing with tickets that you're

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:31,080
selling where there are science seats

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,030
obviously and you're going based on the

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,979
best available seating so literally

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,849
every single person's query and what

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,759
they add

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:41,819
their cart is affecting every subsequent

00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,830
query and when you've got a big name

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,479
coming into a venue of a hundred

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,459
thousand-plus seats you've got a

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,229
liquidate four or five hundred thousand

00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:52,499
tickets in this manner in a matter of

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:57,240
minutes so that turns out to be a pretty

00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:59,459
interesting challenge so let's get back

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,339
to to the purpose of the talk though and

00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:05,339
so as I was thinking about getting back

00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:09,869
to fundamentals one of the things that

00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:11,569
struck me is that you know one of the

00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:14,399
things that that I think we deal with

00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:16,110
primarily as engineers is thinking about

00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:20,610
what technologies we're going to use and

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:22,349
I think companies sort of struggle to

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,509
figure out how to make smart decisions

00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:27,269
about the technologies that they choose

00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:28,740
and I think you you see that manifests

00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:31,349
in a lot of different ways and so I'd

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,409
like to walk through the decision

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:37,019
framework that I've been able to use a

00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:39,439
few different companies and I think I

00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:43,529
think hopefully you'll find it helpful

00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:46,409
but before we get to that let's let's go

00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:48,509
even farther down the rabbit hole of

00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:50,939
fundamentals here and and think for a

00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,949
minute about what is your job right like

00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:54,180
why why are you gainfully employed why

00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,599
are they paying you a lot of money to be

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,309
an engineer what what is your job as you

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,990
think about it I'm gonna assert it's

00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:03,629
it's probably not what you're thinking

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:07,139
I'm gonna assert that your job is to

00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:10,529
make yourself obsolete and that is what

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,019
the critical aspect is of thinking about

00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:15,779
how you make technological choices is

00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,369
how do you make sure that you are not a

00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:21,089
single point of failure for your

00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:23,939
organization and I really liked Donovan

00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:25,529
Browns definition where DevOps is the

00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,740
union of people processing products to

00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,309
enable continuous delivery of value to

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,459
end-users

00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:34,229
right the technology is fun but

00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:37,529
ultimately it's about delivering value

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:39,419
so how do you make sure that as your

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:41,550
observability platforms get better as

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,680
your CI CD pipelines get better as

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,300
you're eliminating toil you're you're

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,380
moving farther and farther up the stack

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,780
and you're May

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,780
things ultimately better for your users

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:58,740
and so again when we think about the the

00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:05,940
buzz that you experience on these

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:07,500
platforms there's sort of broad

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,200
recognition that the industry moves

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:15,380
really fast right and we celebrate new

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:18,090
technology but at what cost I think

00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,770
there's a tendency as humans to sort of

00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,020
fear what we're not familiar with what

00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:26,690
we don't understand and that sort of

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,690
pushes us to - what's shiny and new and

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:34,440
you're hopefully familiar with the hype

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,910
curve and so whenever there's new

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,070
technology that comes out you've got

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,770
this this sort of surge of excitement

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,030
about what it might be and then the sort

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,040
of descent into the trough of

00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,960
disillusionment as you realise that it's

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,790
probably not all it's cracked up to be

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,240
and then eventually sort of the new

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,980
technology will plateau and when you're

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,930
an early adopter like you're you're

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,840
feeling a lot of that pain when when

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,280
you're jumping on the exciting things

00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,300
and then there's this this great law

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,870
Hofstadter's law

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:06,780
he's a cognitive scientist and he says

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,460
it takes longer than you expect it

00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,960
always takes longer than you expect even

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:14,850
when you take into account Hofstadter's

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,800
law and so you you take together the

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,350
hype curve and you take together our

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,330
natural tendencies to underestimate how

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,400
long things are going to take and you

00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,750
get this exuberance that like alright

00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,070
this new technology is gonna solve all

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,710
of my problems

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:31,500
it's rainbows and unicorns it's gonna be

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,680
amazing and then you realize that it's

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,970
not so cool yeah it's sad you know

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,190
there's that moment when you're

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,770
searching for a gift for your slide and

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:45,870
like you can't imagine a more perfect

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:48,890
gift that was this so my assertion is

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,890
that there's a better way and

00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,420
in order to do it don't worry about the

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,340
the screen it'll be fine

00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,590
I think the the first thing you've got

00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,320
to think about is how in your

00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:05,350
environment you make sure that there's

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,400
psychological safety you've got to

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,010
create an environment where people

00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,600
really genuinely want to hear each

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:16,930
other's feedback and there's an interest

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,750
on behalf of individuals and teams in

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,910
seeing their peers succeed right if

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,620
you're if you've got that vested

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,980
interest in one another's success I

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:30,360
think it makes it much easier to fight

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,560
against some of these challenges and so

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,390
what I've tended to do is establish

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,920
guiding principles so I'm going to lay

00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,740
out the the guiding principles that I've

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,050
been using it's eek eeeek and companies

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,670
before that your guiding principles may

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,700
be different but this is sort of how we

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,170
approach considering technology and so

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,380
the first thing is the deliberate

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,540
pursuit of simplicity which allows us to

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,450
hone our craft over time to build trust

00:11:52,540 --> 00:12:00,700
in our tools and to foster a shared

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:03,610
experience among teams right so we are

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:07,390
knowingly trying to keep our solutions

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:11,589
simple and we're really actively trying

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:14,080
to make sure that we develop expertise

00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:16,570
shared expertise and our tools and our

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,980
platforms so that we can continue to

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,170
navigate change right because we have to

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,870
deliver value for customers we're not

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,060
just trying to deliver technology for

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,400
technology's sake we also have to

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,010
recognize the forces around us right and

00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,770
so obligatory Conway's law reference

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,930
where organisations which design systems

00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,820
are constrained to produce designs which

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,740
are copies of those communication

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,210
structures so basically your

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,520
architecture is gonna represent whatever

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,470
your org chart is right like naturally

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,020
your systems and your API endpoints are

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,080
gonna be a reflection of how your teams

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,930
are structured in the same paper this

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,400
was written in 1968 there's a lot of

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,589
quotable things from this paper but I

00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,089
really like this as well there's never

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:00,589
enough time to do something right but

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:02,449
there's always enough time to do it over

00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:03,949
and so I don't know about you but I've

00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,420
been involved in lots of projects where

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,610
we race to the finish line only to

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,019
realize that it's not gonna work for one

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,540
reason or another and you've got a

00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:16,310
double back and redo it once twice three

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:20,680
times and Counting and so what does this

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:23,329
decision framework look like the

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,160
fundamental thing that I do here in

00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:27,439
terms of drawing distinctions is how you

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,449
think about what I'm describing is known

00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:31,939
technologies versus unknown technologies

00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:34,790
where an own technology is something

00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:37,279
that you operate in production today so

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,110
your team's got the sort of muscle

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,600
memory for dealing with this technology

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,759
knows its behaviors knows its patterns

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,079
knows what to expect where unknown

00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,660
technologies are things that you're not

00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:50,449
running in production yet so there would

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:53,569
be a lot of things to learn for the

00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:55,490
broader team and the way that we attack

00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:57,920
known technologies is with an RFC

00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,990
process the way we attack unknown

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,649
technologies is with the process that I

00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:06,709
described as departures and departures

00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:09,559
are really just a specialized version of

00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:11,000
an RFC so RFC's have been around for a

00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:13,399
long time and they've been actually

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,110
gaining quite a bit of prominence

00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,850
internally at companies over the last

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,370
several years I've been using them for

00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:22,129
gosh coming up on probably 10 years now

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,620
I'm curious just quick show of hands how

00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:30,709
many of you have a RFC process in your

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:33,589
organisation Wow not very many okay so

00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:36,470
let's let's run through what we do with

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:38,389
these requests for comments so the first

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,490
thing is why why do you bother with this

00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:43,639
process and and the biggest certian that

00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,110
i'm gonna make to start is that your

00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,809
system design is always going to be

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,029
better if you start with pros and i know

00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:53,269
like we want to race into writing code

00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:55,250
but if you can slow down and and put pen

00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:57,079
to paper your thoughts on why it is that

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,749
you want to approach a given problem

00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:02,059
with a specific technical solution

00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:05,929
you're absolutely going to get a better

00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:08,179
first version of your design the other

00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:10,470
big reason for RFC's is knowledge

00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:12,210
sharing right so you you

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,890
are working through your solution and

00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,050
maybe people close to you on your team

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:18,090
are aware of what you're doing and are

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,670
learning from what's happening but the

00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:23,700
the broader engineering team likely is

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:26,670
not unless you are really thoughtful

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,370
about how you share knowledge it

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,470
transcends geography right so

00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,360
increasingly engineering work is very

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,450
distributed and we've got engineers all

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,010
over the place how do you how do you

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,950
make sure that everybody can participate

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:44,820
in understanding and evolving what your

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:47,610
architecture is and also creating an

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:50,250
asynchronous process like this really

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,670
sort of helps to combat the the timezone

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,500
challenges of coordinating across Gio's

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:57,870
and anyone can participate so that's

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,270
hiki cui we broadcast these in a really

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,310
wide way and so it's very common on

00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,810
RFC's to see commentary coming in from

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,910
folks on the sales team the marketing

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,650
team in a way that would never happen

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,330
without a process like this until

00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,370
something got to production and they

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,420
said oh actually that's probably not

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:18,690
going to work for one reason or another

00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:22,080
and so how do we go about it we very

00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:24,210
very basic stuff here we use Google Docs

00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,820
and have a standard template that

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,650
everybody uses the high-level gist of

00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,180
what that template looks like is to

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,340
offer up some prior reading like what

00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,530
are the things that you should look at

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,600
in terms of internal and external

00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:38,070
documentation to be ramped up on on what

00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,840
we're trying to accomplish what are the

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:42,660
high level goals of the project right I

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,220
think again critically why are we trying

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,200
to solve this problem before you get

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,380
into what the technology is and then

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,990
possible solutions where we use this

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,820
this structure where you will list out

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,380
the things that you considered and be

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,470
very explicit about the ones that were

00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,720
rejected before getting to the approach

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,000
that you chose as your accepted solution

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,970
and then you dive into what that entails

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,770
in your implementation overview and then

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,720
you need a broadcast mechanism and so

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,060
again we keep it very simple it's just a

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,189
Google Form you go to submit this Google

00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,160
Form and then your RNC gets blasted out

00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:19,319
to a slack channel and an email group

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,420
the forum responses are in a spreadsheet

00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,040
that is open to everybody so you've got

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,650
a long run

00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,360
database' of what although RFC's have

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:30,530
been and you can check on on their

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,360
statuses and then the question that I

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,830
often get is will win when should I be

00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,920
sending these RFC's how should I think

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:40,340
about that and this is sort of what I've

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,920
anchored on over time which is if you

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,440
owe if another team was working on a

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,540
similar thing would you be interested in

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,340
learning about that design would you be

00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,740
interested in being able to participate

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,530
in the conversation so it's really like

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:58,130
what's going on that you think is of

00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:00,050
interest and then critically you want to

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,730
send them out before you're in love with

00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,290
your new design right I think we've all

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,790
been in that place where you've got your

00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,620
design and now you're in love with it

00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,850
and nobody's gonna tell you that that's

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,900
not the right way to do it so you

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,100
certainly will have to do some

00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,510
exploration probably some

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,120
proof-of-concept ink but you want to get

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,360
the RFC's out before you get to a place

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,420
where you're really unable to absorb the

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,100
feedback and then the next question I

00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,370
get about RFC's is well who gets to

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,350
decide right what I'm describing sounds

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:34,100
like it's gonna be some big messy like

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:36,170
committee based process right the way

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,910
that I oriented this is that the tie

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,880
goes to the runner so the agency lies

00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:43,540
with the team that's driving forward the

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,590
technological change with this RFC and

00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,480
I've been doing this for years and years

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,460
and years and I think when you create

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,030
the right environment where people again

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,770
are vested in each other's success the

00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,140
number of times where I've had to get in

00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,240
and referee on an RFC I could count on

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,440
one hand I mean it just doesn't happen

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,440
when you create the right environment

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:07,460
but technologies that are unknown again

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,010
I think I think we need a slightly

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:13,130
different approach and that's what these

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:17,660
departures look like and I want to give

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:20,270
a quick hat tip to Kellan who's formerly

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,120
seats you over Etsy these days he's

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:25,880
hanging out at Dropbox and I was talking

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,070
about the the ways that I've been

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,870
wrestling with managing technological

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,760
change and he weren't he and I were

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,870
spitballing on how he'd been dealing

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,280
with things and how it I

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,100
I've been dealing with things and that

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:40,309
sort of led me to this process so a lot

00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:43,670
of credit to to Kellan and sharing beers

00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:47,660
and horror stories about managing

00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:48,710
technological change and so technology

00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,160
was fast

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,660
and the established patterns eventually

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,550
break down right like your your

00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,410
architecture matures you get more scale

00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,700
you move into adjacent markets and

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,800
eventually the things that you're doing

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,910
become insufficient so you've got a

00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,320
drive change but what I want people to

00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,360
do when they're thinking about driving

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,660
changes is be a little bit skeptical

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,309
right don't don't just rush into to the

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,640
new thing without really thinking

00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:19,370
through what's at hand here and I'm

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,320
making a few assertions and the first is

00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,700
that look no technology's perfect we

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,470
hear it all the time there's no silver

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,830
bullets this is a this is a very real

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:31,190
factor and living on the bleeding edge

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:33,920
is is painful if you are the biggest

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:36,650
user of a piece of software there isn't

00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,910
gonna be much you can do when you run

00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,110
start running into problems in

00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,740
production there isn't really going to

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:44,450
be anybody you can turn to to help and

00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,800
then switching to new technologies

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,260
always adds the technical debt first

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,000
right so I think fairly logically or if

00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,920
you've got an old system and you're

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,020
introducing a new way of doing it are

00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,880
you running two systems hopefully the

00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,429
the new system will replace the old

00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,200
system but we've also I'm sure all seen

00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,910
instances of the new system not working

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,070
out and now the new system represents

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,290
technical debt so no matter how you go

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:09,650
you're gonna have some struggles of

00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:11,660
navigating technical seven and again

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:14,270
prediction is is really hard it's just

00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:20,120
something we humans are not not very

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:22,190
good at and lastly the the the old adage

00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,690
of like oh you know I built it at the

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,130
last hackathon we should just put it in

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,450
production or I spent the weekend

00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,390
working on this project it's ready to go

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:34,370
is never never never a good reason to

00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:35,929
deploy technology and then the the

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,010
transfer of knowledge you know the the

00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:38,900
whole thrust of what I'm talking about

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,910
here is is about how we share

00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,790
information with one another and how how

00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,330
we try to have this shared understanding

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,700
of what your

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,049
architecture looks like but the reality

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,159
is there's always going to be nuances

00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:50,840
there's always going to be subtleties

00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:54,860
there's there's just never going to be

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:59,029
this this true shared understanding and

00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:01,190
then there's there's really a sort of

00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:04,909
spectrum in terms of how you should be

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:07,309
approaching this so a internal tool

00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:09,500
that's got a handful of users should

00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,750
have a very different calculus than a

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,269
tier-one service running in production

00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:17,659
that's dealing with enormous amounts of

00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:19,909
traffic that you know wanting to change

00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:21,590
out a component there should have a much

00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:23,450
higher degree of scrutiny than then

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:27,409
again the other end of the spectrum with

00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:30,019
internal tooling and so in being

00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:33,730
skeptical the posture that I sort of ask

00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:35,659
folks to take is I have this crazy idea

00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,750
please talk me out of it

00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:40,909
right and be be open to having the

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,500
conversations and being challenged and

00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:44,690
figure out if if you're on the right

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,539
path so again we're gonna put pen to

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:50,600
paper I think that's how you're you're

00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:52,100
gonna express your ideas best and I want

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,230
to stress here that I've been talking

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,750
about some processes that we use as an

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,580
organization but as we saw you know a

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,039
lot of folks aren't in places that have

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,840
RFC processes or things like that so as

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:07,220
I dig into these departure questions

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,159
what I want to stress to you all is that

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,470
like if you follow this approach I think

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,179
you'll make better decisions as an

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,940
individual and I think you'll be able to

00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:18,649
use this information to make more

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:22,070
convincing arguments when you're ready

00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:24,559
to drive things forward so I'm gonna lay

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:26,149
out 10 questions and I think again if

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,909
you get these 10 questions right you're

00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:31,700
you're gonna be in business to do what

00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:33,200
you want to do first one obvious very

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,330
basic what problem are you trying to

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,309
solve this really though suss it out

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,409
whether whether you're chasing

00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:41,299
technology for technology's sake or if

00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:44,809
you've got a legitimate problem that

00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:47,720
requires something new the second

00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:48,590
question is how could we solve it with

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,809
the current stack

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,909
I think there's again this tendency to

00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:54,770
jump into something new but how how

00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:56,779
could we actually do it with the

00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,150
existing technology is deployed in our

00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:59,380
organization

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,450
even if it ends up looking like a Rube

00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,570
Goldberg machine like if you haven't

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:06,640
thought deeply enough about your problem

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,980
to be able to answer this question I

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,610
think you're probably on the wrong track

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,900
jumping to something new but once you've

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,670
thought about it then that should give

00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,250
you the ammunition to really describe

00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,260
what's difficult about your current

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,860
stack with respect to the solution that

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:25,750
you're trying to drive so at a very real

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:29,830
example of this just a couple weeks ago

00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:31,660
at Sica where big rabbitmq users and an

00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,460
engineer is dealing with one of these

00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,980
processes that as we've scaled is sort

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,140
of not really working anymore any put

00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,960
together sort of a detailed plan of how

00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,330
he could refactor it to continue to work

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,700
with rabbit and it was painfully obvious

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,770
as as he detailed the way to do it that

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:52,210
it just wasn't gonna work and it was

00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:54,040
time to move on next one is the risks

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,980
right which is quite a bit difficult

00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:59,140
different than what's difficult and and

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,480
I pull these questions out separately to

00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:04,690
get people to think about articulating

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,880
them differently because there's

00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,740
certainly risks with with sticking with

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,910
old technology and so what are those how

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,630
do we quantify them how do we think

00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:15,340
about what makes sense going forward and

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,680
then speaking of quantification you've

00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,360
got costs right so when we're jumping to

00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,520
the new technology let's let's be clear

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,580
right about what is it gonna mean in

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,160
terms of costs for people time new

00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,800
licenses hardware there's there's all

00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,840
kinds of things that could impact what

00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,410
what the costs are gonna look like and

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,480
then critically how are other people

00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,870
solving the problem that you've got I

00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,460
think what I love about being an

00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:44,560
engineer and working in this industry is

00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:47,500
how open we all are about talking about

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,770
our technical solutions you know there

00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,650
there's a lot of proprietary concerns on

00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:55,720
the business side of organizations but

00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:58,180
on the engineering side we can trade

00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,340
stories about how we're solving problems

00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,100
and

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,390
really dig deep on on what those

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,280
solutions look like so take advantage

00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,650
like reach out to people and figure out

00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,080
when they went with the technology that

00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,179
you were looking at what did they like

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,730
about it what did they hate about it

00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:16,380
what were they surprised by and I think

00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,350
armed with that information you're gonna

00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:22,740
end up with a much better implementation

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:24,660
for yourself and then are we committed

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,990
to moving everything to this new

00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,549
technology so you've got to have a plan

00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,740
in my opinion when you're moving to

00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:35,880
something new to make sure that the new

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:37,950
software can completely eat whatever the

00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,140
existing solution is right you've got to

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,059
get to a hundred percent - - getting rid

00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:45,660
of what the old thing was what does that

00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:48,870
plan actually look like which leads to

00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:51,870
the classic xkcd of you know when

00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,070
whenever there's a challenge of too many

00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,840
systems doing the same thing you

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,630
introduce a new system it's gonna

00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,730
replace everything and of course it does

00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,530
not but this is why you need a plan

00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,960
right and this stuff is hard cuz getting

00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,549
to that that 80% mark is is sort of easy

00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,780
bits getting to a hundred percent

00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:12,000
getting all the way is much tougher

00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:15,270
what's a low-risk way to get started is

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,620
is the next important question so again

00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,900
is there some internal tool well you

00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:22,140
could deploy it first if it's a new data

00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,630
pipeline can you introduce it in a dark

00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,179
mode running with the old pipeline and

00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,490
the new pipeline at the same time same

00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:33,000
thing with data stores there's there's

00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:35,250
always ways to try all the technology

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,900
before you're all the way committed and

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:40,169
figure out all right if it's not working

00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:42,240
how do we bail what does it look like

00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:44,309
who else is supportive of this new

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,900
approach right I think there's usually

00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,960
the sort of one or two evangelist that

00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,520
are super excited about a new technology

00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,650
but have you been able to persuade other

00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,780
people at the organization that this is

00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:57,840
a good way to go I think that's a

00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:00,750
critical part of successes is again

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,240
getting everybody to be sort of bought

00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:06,000
into the direction that you're taking

00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:10,409
and then how will we teach people this

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,909
new technology so back at tumblr early

00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:17,309
days of Kotlin support on Android we had

00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:19,500
Android engineers spread across a whole

00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:21,539
bunch of different teams and sort of a

00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,830
typical scenario for new technology

00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,240
there's one engineer that was super

00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,340
passionate about Kotlin was ready to

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,500
rewrite the whole app and just rush

00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,700
right into it and this is the question

00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,890
that made him sort of stop and think

00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,659
well all right we got engineers all over

00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:37,200
the place how actually are we gonna do

00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:40,230
this and he created study groups and and

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,090
found a way to get everybody excited and

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,240
engaged in a way that allowed us to

00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:49,440
commit Scotland even though it was

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:52,380
pretty early days and so running through

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,480
sort of a quick recap here it's

00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,000
important to have an environment that's

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,799
going to nurture the way that you think

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,169
about technological change right so this

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,940
is a big thing for managers to be

00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:04,559
thinking about lay out those principles

00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,450
so that everybody can be really

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,720
deliberate about the decisions that

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,309
you're making I'm a big fan of RFC's it

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,559
definitely would recommend you to look

00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:15,659
into seeing if you can get those going I

00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:17,580
think you can do them even within a team

00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:21,299
context you don't need them to be some

00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:23,010
company-wide thing at the outset I would

00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:25,110
strongly consider using this this

00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:27,270
departure framework even if it's just

00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:29,460
for your own writing your own thinking

00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:34,230
to to make sure that you're on the right

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:36,149
track just a quick recap of all the

00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,960
questions that I think you should be

00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:41,940
using and again as a reminder like I

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,669
think your job is to make yourself

00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,990
obsolete I think if you do that that's

00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:48,690
when you become truly indispensable

00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:50,340
right when you're able to make sure that

00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:52,380
you're able to move up to higher order

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,970
problems things that are gonna deliver

00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,779
more leverage you are gonna be

00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,620
ultimately much much much more valuable

00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:02,130
which is going to be good for your

00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:06,320
pocketbook and I hope you enjoy it and

00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,320
please enjoy hacker news responsibly

00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:17,219
[Applause]
