00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,570
why should you do public speaking at all

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:16,020
do it does everybody recognize this

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:17,150
brand there's always one jackass in the

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,240
audience

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:24,210
anyway that's Nike and why do you know

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,300
that because you haven't been living

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,590
under a rock for the past 30 years I

00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,260
would just like to let you know that the

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,239
Kiev audience was even better than you

00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:36,000
[Music]

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:39,149
anyway so you might associate their

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,399
brand with Michael Jordan or LeBron

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,010
James or some other great athlete or

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,390
other person does good things which

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,550
leads me to my first point this is your

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,539
brand your brand is what people

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,550
associate with you and your name and you

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,079
want those things to be good and one way

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,590
to do that is to do public speaking

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,930
about things that you know point number

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,900
2 public speaking makes you better at

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,159
regular speaking it might be useful in

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,260
things like life it boosts your

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,270
confidence look how confident see

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,950
confident she is it makes you look

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,740
important then people have to listen to

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,100
you important listen to me back an

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,240
average anyway so now that I've

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,720
convinced you they should do public

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,640
speaking

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,439
why ignite so think big start small it's

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,710
not only clipart that I stole from the

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,890
internet you're gambling you don't know

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,960
if you're gonna be good at this yet you

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,409
might go broke you might hit the jackpot

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,479
we don't know and because of that we go

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,869
for the nickel slots not ten thousand

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:54,720
dollars a hand blackjack table it's only

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:57,470
five minutes so if I'm horrible it

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,470
doesn't last that long

00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:03,590
also when you're less experienced you

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,149
need to have more improvement cycles so

00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,610
when you do two and a 20-minute talk it

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,500
takes a long time to rehearse that and

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,020
you have to do so many more of those

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,800
it's very hard this one you can get

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,820
twelve these

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,520
an hour that's serious but don't do that

00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:22,830
also now that you've done that and you

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,230
have like you have the Ignite you have a

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,200
movie trailer for your big talk which

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,060
you can submit with your big talk to the

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,340
next conference which is pretty awesome

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:38,280
it lets people know how you deliver on

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:41,040
this specific topic very useful so now

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,080
that I've told you that a you should do

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,270
public speaking and be that ignites are

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,270
the right way to go how to go about

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:53,220
ignites does everybody recognize this

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:57,600
man do you recognize this man yes

00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,900
give me like wake the up so that is

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,630
Jerry store or otherwise known as George

Costanza father in Seinfeld now he came

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,980
up with this amazing holiday called

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,800
Festivus which has a custom called the

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,510
airing of grievances where you wait for

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,700
your entire family to get all hungry and

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,890
sit down at the table and write when

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,420
they're ready to eat you tell them how

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:24,450
much they've disappointed you in the

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:27,330
past year in other words complain so you

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:31,610
may say oh come on who's gonna let you

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,750
go on stage and complain oh dear people

00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,660

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,390

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,060
conferences right here here's me

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:47,160
complaining our doctor in health Ilya

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:49,860
I'm complaining to you right now then

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,840
you make slides if you recognize this

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,840
that's sign number two that you are old

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,860
sign number three that you're old you

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,630
recognize who these guys are these

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,640
players were notorious for never

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,810
practicing anything they also don't have

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,700
championship rings

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,870
might be related then you do Kaizen but

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,040
we don't have time to talk about that

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:17,060
it's only five minutes so make slides

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,140
practice and improve profit thank you

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,870
wait wait wait wait wait

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,900
I'm gonna put on my organizers hat for a

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,640
second what you don't believe on the

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,640
organizers wear this look

00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:35,729
so as an organizer I can tell you that

00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:37,620
it's much easier for us to take a gamble

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,939
on ignites meaning if you're a

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,039
first-time speaker and you want to get

00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:43,319
into doing this it's much easier as

00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,110
easier for us to let you try out things

00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:49,379
at ignites and I'm looking at you the

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,919
younger people on the crowd so do more

00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:52,229
ignites

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,380
and if you need any guidance talk to me

00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:58,560
and thank you very much

00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:03,699
[Applause]

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,699
