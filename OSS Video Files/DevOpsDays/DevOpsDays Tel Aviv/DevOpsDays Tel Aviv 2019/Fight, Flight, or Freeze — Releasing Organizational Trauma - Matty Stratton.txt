Title: Fight, Flight, or Freeze — Releasing Organizational Trauma - Matty Stratton
Publication date: 2020-01-21
Playlist: DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2019
Description: 
	When humans are faced with a traumatic experience, our brains kick in with survival mechanisms. These mechanisms are the familiar fight or flight response, but can also include the freeze response - which occurs when we are terrified or feel that there is no chance of escape.

Sufferers of post-traumatic stress continue to feel these fight, flight, and freeze responses long after the trauma has passed, because our brains are unable to differentiate between the memory of trauma and an actually occurring event. When activated or triggered, the brain reverts to these behaviors, which are then expressed in the person’s body (through posture, disassociation, muscle tension, etc).

The same can occur to organizations - once an organization has experienced a trauma (a large outage, say) the “memory” of that trauma leads to a deregulated state whenever activated (by symptoms of similar indicators, such as system alerts, customer issues, and more). The organization will insist on revisiting the same fight, flight, or freeze response as the embedded trauma has caused, which, like a triggered post-traumatic stress sufferer, is a false equivalency.

00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:08,730
little bit not to give you too much

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,920
topic whiplash but we just had some nice

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,509
deep dive into Kafka now we're gonna

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,299
talk a little bit more about the

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,590
psychology around incident response and

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,770
we're also going to talk about zebras a

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,600
little bit but trust me it'll make sense

00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,970
so just a couple things I like to cover

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,019
quickly in this talk I talked a little

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,390
bit about trauma and post-traumatic

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,119
stress we don't talk about any specific

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,780
trauma stuff but I always like to make

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,090
sure people are aware of that and

00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,340
another disclaimer the second while I'm

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,899
a trauma survivor I am NOT a mental

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,500
health professional so none of this is

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,110
actual medical advice so you know don't

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,789
call your lawyers or anything like that

00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,190
cool so who am i right so my name is

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,840
Matt Stratton I'm fairly well known in

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,309
the DevOps community primarily because I

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,489
really like died coke oh hey I work for

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,410
pager duty how many people here are

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,539
familiar I've heard of pager duty ok

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,159
cool then I did my job of that paid for

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,840
a pager Duty paying for me to come here

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,330
that's pretty much probably the last

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,680
time we're gonna talk about pager duty

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,200
except for maybe some stories I might

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,659
tell around how we do things at pager

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,310
duty and according to Ryan kitchens and

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,950
Netflix I have the best hair of all

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,720
developer advocates so this is my

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,070
equivalent of a resume slide a lot of

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,509
times people like to say this is why you

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,710
should listen to me apparently I think

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,000
you should listen to me because I like

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:33,210
Diet Coke so I don't know they should

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,200
write my validation is that dr4 is

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,030
growing that we heard from yesterday

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,159
also really loves Diet Coke so if Nicole

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,930
does it then it's got to be right so

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,890
cool right alright so let's talk about

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,619
zebras so if we think about a zebra

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,299
that's at rest to sort of chilling out

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,700
there on the Savannah there's no threat

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,939
of predators its operating within what

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,430
we call the rest and digest function of

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,259
the parasympathetic nervous system right

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,990
it's just kind of hanging out there

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,350
it literally is resting digesting eating

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,630
grass everything's cool enter a lion

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,110
right so now the Zebras being chased by

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,349
a lion

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,540
so there are drastic changes to the

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,890
Zebras body that happen with the

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,590
activation of what's called

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,380
fight-or-flight response of the

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,870
sympathetic nervous system so the heart

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,540
rate increases its breathing rate

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,940
increases right there's large amounts of

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,740
stress hormones like cortisol and

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,370
adrenaline are released into the Zebras

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,250
bloodstream

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,770
the pupils dilate any non-essential

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,290
functions shut down like digestion right

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,630
the Zebras nervous system is preparing

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,510
for to literally run for its life

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:45,300
right so it's focusing on that now say

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,370
the zebra gets caught its nervous system

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,950
is now overwhelmed right it has no

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,040
further solutions this is called freeze

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,410
it basically plays dead right so the

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,000
lion then drops the zebra goes to maybe

00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,220
try to catch another one so maybe the

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,260
zebra gets away and does anybody know

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,610
what the zebra does as soon as it gets

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:09,269
away its shakes it literally shakes it

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,340
shakes it off and it resets its nervous

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,989
system back to that rest and digest and

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,110
it just continues to move on as if

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:19,320
nothing had happened

00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:21,510
that's how zebras do it now if there's

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,269
one thing that you take away from this

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,130
entire DevOps days Tel Aviv conference

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,269
it's gonna be this next point so you

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,860
might want to get your camera's ready

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,239
this is probably the most important

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,489
slide you will see it at any DevOps

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,799
conference this year and I can say that

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,079
and it is this

00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,519
humans are not zebras right so if you

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,320
learn nothing else is that we are not

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,140
zebras so we don't respond the same way

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,489
to things like this right so this thing

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,950
we call the autonomous nervous system

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,620
which is fight or flight it's common to

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,660
all mammals right so all all mammals

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,690
have that but we have this thing called

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,269
a prefrontal cortex right and zebras and

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,780
other mammals don't have it and usually

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:02,940
this prefrontal cortex is an advantage

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,500
this is where executive function happens

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,630
it's because of this that we can do

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,040
pattern recognition we can understand

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,350
the difference between good and Bad's

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,150
same and different we can understand

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,450
consequences because of this prefrontal

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,609
cortex the problem is this is also where

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,549
we mentally replay traumatic scenarios

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:23,400
right and that activates our sympathetic

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:26,970
nervous system it activates our body the

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,750
same way that a real threat does one of

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,270
the things that

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,670
amazing about humans is our brains are

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,010
incredibly intelligent and really super

00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,420
smart and they're also really really

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,160
dumb okay

00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,720
they can't tell the difference between

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,930
real and perceived threat

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,530
whereas zebras can so dr. Peter Levine

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,830
who's a psychologist who's done a lot of

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,080
work around post-traumatic stress and

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,120
also who I stole the zebra metaphor from

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,880
said you know animals in the wild are

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,400
not traumatized by routine threats to

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,410
their lives this happens all the time if

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,570
you're a zebra you get chased by lions a

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:06,419
lot they aren't traumatized by it they

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,300
shake it off they move on but humans we

00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:12,600
can be overwhelmed and we're subject to

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,760
symptoms like hyper arousal shutdown and

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,080
dysregulation this is a thing and

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,390
another way to look at it is we think

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,040
about this idea this is something called

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,380
the window of tolerance so this isn't a

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,930
healthy nervous system something happens

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,630
we get activated our sympathetic nervous

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,360
system kicks in you know again just like

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,820
it does with the zebra and then the

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,680
thing that was upsetting stops and then

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,090
we go back and we settle and we continue

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,620
to move and this is a healthy nervous

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,330
system and this area where we live

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,860
inside of this is called the window of

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,750
tolerance right this is emotional

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,030
arousal that's optimal for well-being

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,229
and effective functioning okay so we

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,510
have this little window of tolerance

00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:54,270
what happens with trauma it looks a

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,100
little more like this right so when a

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,050
traumatic event occurs something that

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,169
our nervous system is not prepared to be

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,260
able to respond to and it comes in there

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:06,690
instead of kind of being in this this is

00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,120
this easy little parabola right we have

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,919
this this this spiky looking graph and

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,190
this looks like a really bad Nagios

00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,780
monitor and so that I'm making

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,340
connections it works right so we can

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,290
either be going up and down and up and

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,510
down right on either end or we can get

00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,910
stuck on or stuck off and these things

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,430
are pretty common being stuck in either

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,580
way so if we're stuck on that's where we

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:32,340
we see symptoms around anxiety right the

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,800
inability to relax restlessness hyper

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,599
vigilance digestive problems which makes

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,030
sense because again it's changing our

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,190
physiology if we get stuck off that's

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,930
where we see things like depression

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,610
lethargy and again more digestive

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,720
problems it's it's like these things are

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,220
connected so what is what does this have

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,930
to do with anything right so the first

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,820
thing to bear in mind is trauma is not

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,190
simple right it seems like it is and

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,900
it's just like the systems we work with

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,940
today right like we used to deal with

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,860
very simple systems our systems are

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,600
complex today and trauma

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,030
just like our systems that we work with

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,370
are not simple so a couple things to

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,780
think about right so trauma happens

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,850
because your nervous system is

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,030
overwhelmed that's the difference the

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,890
exact same thing can be traumatic to you

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,450
and maybe not in a different time

00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:26,010
because of how your nervous system

00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:28,470
responds and it's the same for real and

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,060
imagined threats like I said you know it

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:33,000
can be a real threat or a perceived

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,320
threat your physiology your body and

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,470
your nervous is I'm gonna respond the

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,870
same and it's also subjective and

00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:42,750
relative and this is really really key

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,300
what I perceive is overwhelming or my

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,860
capacity for a solution may be different

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,010
than what you perceive as as

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,740
overwhelming so what does this have to

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,780
do with companies and organizations

00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,760
right you're I wouldn't come for mental

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,740
health conference here we want to talk

00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,970
about how our our teams and our

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,700
organizations can be better and the

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,990
story behind this talk was when I was

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,580
starting to learn about post-traumatic

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,710
stress and I was going through treatment

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,720
for post-traumatic stress disorder a lot

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,880
of this sounded really similar to how

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,000
all the companies and teams that I work

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,700
with around Incident Response that we

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,470
can rehab really really similarly so if

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,250
we go back and we think about this idea

00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,900
of a dysregulated nervous system how is

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,219
this similar to what happens in a

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,690
company or an organization when a

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,490
traumatic event occurs which in this

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,400
case might be just an incident or an

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:41,669
outage this is it's like trauma right so

00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,650
something happens and where those places

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,970
come in again as we think about the

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,430
difference inside that window of

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:50,160
Tolerance so there's this first idea is

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:53,520
being hyper aroused that's being stuck

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,140
on up the up side the top part of the

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,640
graph of the window

00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,520
this is being stuck in fight-or-flight

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,500
right and so an organization that's

00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,130
hyper aroused that this is how their

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,180
response to two to two incidents and

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,650
outages they display effects of of

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,850
constant vigilance right it sounds like

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,950
they're fighting Voldemort

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,100
you know it's we're hyper aware of

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,720
threats everyone's out to get us and

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,640
this takes energy away from moving

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,440
forward if we're always kind of looking

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,920
over our shoulder and concerned that

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,240
everything is a potential downside of

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,280
thing that can happen we're never gonna

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,400
want to do we're not putting energy into

00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:37,030
innovating right this can be reflected

00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,160
we can see this in how leadership and

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,290
your organization approaches outages and

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,500
incidents we see a lot of wartime

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,670
metaphors in those production support

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,840
teams how many people have been in an

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,400
organization where you have a team

00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,590
that's dedicated just to fixing

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,210
production bugs outside of the delivery

00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,320
team we're in a DevOps conference so we

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,800
kind of understand we don't want to do

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,140
that anymore

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,480
but usually organizations that are stuck

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,630
on will have devoted teams that do

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,820
nothing but fixing broken that

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,960
doesn't work out too well right and then

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,790
we can be on the other side we can be

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,390
hypo aroused this is being stuck off

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:12,370
this is being stuck in fries and this is

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:16,720
this idea where again we can't move

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,400
forward because we're frozen because if

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,050
we change something bad is gonna happen

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,810
right this is how we respond to

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,760
incidences by not ever doing anything

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,830
then nothing bad will happen and this

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,120
sounds a little silly but I think we can

00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,830
all think of a company that we probably

00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,670
worker at one time where this was true

00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:36,130
right so we want to think about how we

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,650
respond right we talked about how our

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,840
nervous system responds to trauma how

00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,750
does what are healthier ways for an

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,170
organization to respond so one of the

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,360
things that can happen is we see a

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,610
signal that looks similar to a thing

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,640
that happened before and then we think

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,170
it's the same thing again right like

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,490
last time this happened again think

00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,020
about how your nervous system response

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,610
to trauma right like something that

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,200
reminds your nervous system of this

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,120
traumatic thing is going to cause the

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,790
same response we do this in

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,339
organizations we see something starting

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,839
to shape a certain way and

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:14,009
like this looks like the last time this

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:17,550
happened again our systems are complex

00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:19,860
and there was a time decades ago in my

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,540
career where I used to say I could tell

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,879
a good sysadmin because they would sit

00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,309
there and shake their head and Stroke

00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:29,249
their chin and say ah I've seen this

00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:31,290
before that doesn't work so well in

00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:32,999
today's distributed in complex systems

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,059
because just because you've seen this

00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:39,120
before does not mean it's the same thing

00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:41,160
again right and complexity is what makes

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,319
this challenging so one way to think

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,399
about this a little bit I give this talk

00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,660
a lot this is the first time I'm giving

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,879
in Israel it's kind of a little bit

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,230
funny and you'll see why because I

00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,300
usually ask how many people flew on a

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,209
plane to get here probably not too many

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,370
people but so we think about this idea

00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:59,189
about how we have to take our shoes off

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,209
when when we're boarding a plane right

00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:02,069
or when we're going through an airport

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:04,110
and I understand that things are a

00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:05,399
little different in the airport here

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,569
it's probably a little more effective so

00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,189
it's kind of funny for me to be in

00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:10,529
Israel talking about ineffectiveness of

00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:12,689
airport security normally this is a

00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,309
funny thing right but let's think about

00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:17,309
the pattern of what happened right so if

00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:19,079
you don't know and December 22nd of 2001

00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,029
this cat named Richard Reid tried to

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:24,029
ignite explosives in his shoes from a

00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:26,429
flight from Paris to Miami so as a

00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:27,360
result in the States the TSA the

00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:29,939
Transportation Security Administration

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,790
began randomly searching people's shoes

00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:34,350
right and then in 2006 they mandated

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,269
that all passengers had to remove their

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,589
shoes then a few years ago they they

00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:38,879
said well if you give us a hundred bucks

00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,899
you don't have take your shoes off

00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,490
anymore so that's a whole other problem

00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:46,259
by the way money well spent for those of

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,749
us that you know spend all our lives on

00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:50,279
airplanes so what was the response here

00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:52,230
this one was sort of trying to do some

00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:55,050
pattern matching it was like well one

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:58,860
dude put some explosives in his shoes so

00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,540
therefore all shoes are suspect and no

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,999
incident has looked like that since then

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,679
right you know and and but this is it

00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:07,379
sounds a little silly but we do this a

00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,879
lot when we think about incidents that

00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:11,610
occur in our organization where we're

00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,189
like okay we saw this particular monitor

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,870
doing this before so this means that

00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:19,559
it's this same defect and it's not

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,000
necessarily because again we put it in

00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,260
the wayback machine and we think back to

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,880
our lamp stack days

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,770
there were like three connections that

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,720
happen right so there is not too many

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,650
different possible things I mean for

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,870
crying out loud we just heard about

00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:33,600
1,400 different micro services at Wix

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,880
okay pretty sure that every single thing

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,520
that happens is is a different layer of

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,520
complexity so think about it this way

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,960
right so jennifer Brea has said you know

00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,790
we have a saying in medicine that when

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,380
you hear hoofbeats the first thing that

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,000
should come to mind is a horse not a

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,850
zebra how many people have heard that

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,540
that's saying before right okay problem

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,760
is as Jennifer says this cute phrase has

00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,240
killed many zebras because the thing is

00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,680
sometimes it's a zebra and if we're

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,570
operating under this assumption that

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,030
it's always a horse because it's a horse

00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,740
a lot of the times we're gonna miss the

00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,770
zebras also look see this is the second

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,930
time zebras are in this talk so this is

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,850
a lot about this idea of sort of jumping

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,840
on this looking for a root cause when

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,540
we're thinking about incidents right

00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,030
we're like aha okay there is a single

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,620
thing that caused this incident and last

00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,600
time it kind of looked like this so it's

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,100
probably the same thing we're gonna talk

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,300
a little bit about that in a minute but

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,620
I'm not gonna have a whole talk about

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,670
contributing factors and root causes

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:35,340
because that's a different talk but how

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,570
do we understand our organization's

00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,370
window of tolerance because remember

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,200
it's different for every company every

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,870
company has a different window of

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:46,290
tolerance for incidents and outages how

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,580
can we identify when we are dysregulated

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,080
and that's that's one of the little

00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,340
takeaways from this I want you to think

00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,350
about is what are some of the things

00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,660
that your team can do like how can you

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:59,640
identify if you are becoming more stuck

00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:01,380
on or more stuck off right so we talked

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,600
a little bit about what what dr. Levine

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,210
said and there's a similar quote which

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,250
says resilient organizations are not

00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,680
traumatized by routine threats to their

00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:13,500
mission or business right non resilient

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,910
organizations are readily overwhelmed

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,550
and they're often subject to the

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:20,220
symptoms of overreaction shutdown and

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,210
lack of regulated effort right again we

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,030
talked about they we've heard this

00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,620
before in other talks this week this is

00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,450
gonna happen right you're gonna have

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,250
incidents you're gonna have outages is

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,140
this something that's gonna traumatize

00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,090
your organization or something you're

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,980
going to be able to move along and who

00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:38,220
said this it was me

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:41,070
I am NOT a doctor but you have to quote

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,730
yourself in a talk is a lesson that I

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:47,160
learned right okay so how do we take a

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,470
deregulated state and become regulated

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,850
so we talked about the problem right we

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,310
said okay you're like great

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,890
so we're dysregulated we would very much

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,910
like to not be that how can we do that

00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:00,560
so now we're going to talk about some

00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,970
actionable things and so in

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,990
post-traumatic stress treatment in

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:10,650
individuals there's a treatment method

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,810
called somatic experiencing and somatic

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:15,390
experiencing it's a form of alternative

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:17,550
therapy that's aimed at relieving the

00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,950
symptoms of post-traumatic stress and

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,650
other mental and physical trauma related

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,170
health problems by focusing on body

00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:28,170
sensations and it was created by the

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,490
trauma therapist dr. Peter Levine and so

00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,870
I've had this treatment and this was

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,330
where when I started thinking about it

00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,760
the idea is that we're starting with the

00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:38,780
body that's what soma means right it's

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,220
it's about the body and in traditional

00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,840
post traumatic stress treatment it's a

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,210
lot of talk therapy and it's top-down

00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,160
we're talking about why did this happen

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,050
why do we have trauma if we can

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,860
understand where the trauma came from

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,360
we'll get better

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,280
and what we're doing in somatic

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,070
experiencing is we're actually saying

00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,380
let's lead with the body

00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,570
what is the physiological response we

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,900
want to have and then how do we connect

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:06,650
it to our memories of these traumatic

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,120
experiences so what we want to do for

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,940
organizational somatic experiencing is

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,610
create a similar focus on the response

00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,620
to train ourselves to have the reactions

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,260
we'd like to have when we have an

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,550
incident or an outage right again this

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,940
is something we're gonna happen and we

00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:25,890
want to create the physiological

00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:29,340
Association we want to we're never gonna

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,840
make incidents stress-free there plenty

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,540
stressful it's a thing that's gonna

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,700
happen but we want to reduce that and

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,000
one of the main reasons we want to do

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:41,250
this is the number one most important

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,130
thing about affective Incident Response

00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:47,340
is two words and those two words are

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,540
don't panic right so no matter what's

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,160
happening we want to be

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,990
able to have effective incident response

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,580
we need to reduce panic and reducing

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:58,320
stress will help with that okay cool so

00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,820
when we think about somatic we say

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,010
that's body first right

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,780
we don't start with the mind if we start

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,970
with the mind that's sort of like

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,680
looking for the singular root cause

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,360
during an incident the first thing to

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,770
bear in mind is during an incident we

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,510
actually don't really care about what's

00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,160
going wrong what we care about is

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,380
restoring service we are gonna try to

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:21,030
figure out all that stuff later

00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:23,700
um so bear in mind that there's never

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,470
going to be one singular cause there are

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,050
contributing factors and this is similar

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,450
to the nuance and the relativity of

00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:32,430
trauma right the exact same thing that

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,960
happens to me you might have a different

00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,890
experience when it happens to you and

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,900
vice versa

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,430
and that's similarly that we might say

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,830
well there's simply well the root cause

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,540
was that somebody messed up this the

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,770
chef configuration well how did that

00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,230
happen what were the contributing

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:48,330
factors was the person tired was a

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,740
person not trained and it's actually

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,810
probably a lot of these things together

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,160
so a lot of it is thinking about the

00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,020
fact that our systems are complex

00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,660
there's always something broken and

00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,390
what's different today is different than

00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,060
tomorrow so let's think about some of

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,560
these again there is fundamentally there

00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,350
is but one root cause and that root

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,020
cause is the big bang right so move on

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,690
okay cool so then we think about

00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,030
contributing factors right so how do we

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,390
do things to make an association with

00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:22,490
outages and issues into that more of a

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:24,240
safe place right at a place so we are as

00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,160
responders as people that have to

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,260
respond to incidents they are less

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,150
stressful right so one of the ways we

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,710
can do this is with game days right

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,260
where we're basically practicing

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,900
Incident Response among other things and

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,910
game days can be helpful with this we

00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,010
have to do them properly right they need

00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,870
to be low stress and safe the point is

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,380
not to practice decision-making under

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,640
stress and give an example at pager duty

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,460
we do these things we call failure

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,020
Fridays and they're a game day where we

00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,400
you know break something on purpose we

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,340
know we're doing and then when we run it

00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,440
like it's true incident and recently it

00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,930
came up that

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,040
the folks participating the incident

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,950
commander and everything like that

00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,600
shouldn't know what the plan was

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,730
we shouldn't know what system were

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,980
testing right shouldn't know the failure

00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,870
were injecting and I fought pretty hard

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,970
about this and good news is I won

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:18,030
because I said the goal of this is not

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,640
to practice being stressed out we will

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,500
get plenty of practice being stressed

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,860
out we're actually trying to do the

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,780
opposite we're trying to associate our

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,570
practices of incident response with not

00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,060
being stressed out so when we're doing

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,920
this exploration in a game day it's kind

00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,020
of like you need to have guidance it's a

00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,610
little bit like meditation right so what

00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,980
some kinds of trauma meditation can be

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,540
really helpful it can the problem is if

00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,570
you aren't guided through this

00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,970
meditation you're not going to really

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,050
get the best benefit out of it right so

00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,330
sooner or later you're going through

00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,770
Medicaid medication medication helps too

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:56,730
but I don't have any good metaphors for

00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,900
that other than by pager duties but when

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,390
you're going through meditation you may

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,180
encounter a memory of your trauma right

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,830
and if you're not guided what happens

00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,440
right you might be overwhelmed by it you

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,120
might avoid it and so the same thing if

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,320
our game day is not following the usual

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:17,430
rules we aren't creating that proper

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,350
Association so if we do planned failure

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,060
injection in a game day and sometimes we

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,650
call this chaos engineering and whatever

00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,590
but really this is very specific around

00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,510
this particular concept so again this is

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,160
what we do at patreon or failure Fridays

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,140
which actually we do them on any day but

00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,150
we use only do them on Fridays and it's

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,950
fun to say fail your Friday rather than

00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,530
failure any day so we still call it

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,630
failure Friday but the whole point is we

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,060
run them like a real incident right we

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,800
have an incident commander we run them

00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,540
through pager duty we do a post-mortem

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,300
we do everything even though we know

00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,890
exactly what went wrong quote-unquote

00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,800
what went wrong because we did it on

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,690
purpose so this creates this

00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,300
organizational Association that

00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,670
incidents an incident response is just

00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,860
this thing we do man we just do this

00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:04,890
every Friday you know we get on a bridge

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,360
and we go into pager duty and we we you

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,740
know have a scribe and we do all the

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,990
things so that when it happens at 2:00

00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,940
in the morning yeah it sucks cuz it's

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,340
2:00 in the morning but weird

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,799
is really used to doing it and it's got

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,529
this association this is also why we do

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,139
game days during the middle of the day

00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:24,090
because to be honest there's no good

00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:27,000
time for pager duty to be down right

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,440
like y'all who use pager duty don't ever

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,690
want us to be down that would be really

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,190
sad in fact the worst time for page 30

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,549
to be down is the middle of the night

00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:37,379
for us right so the best time if we're

00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:39,480
gonna take an outage is during the day

00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:41,940
San Francisco time when the majority of

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,070
our engineers are awake and around so

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,000
that's why that's when we run our game

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:49,950
days so this is another reason why I

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,629
believe very strongly in that you

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,940
execute all you run all of your

00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:57,330
incidents at their initial severity

00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,669
right even if you start them and realize

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:01,860
hey this actually wasn't an incident or

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:04,830
we thought this was a sub one but really

00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,960
it's a 7-3 you still we like to say you

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,700
know you don't litigate severity during

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,600
an incident right part of that is

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,980
because you're gonna spend all your time

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,049
argue about whether or not it's really a

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,309
seven or a seven three and by the time

00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:16,350
you're done arguing it's you know ten

00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,820
minutes into a sub one that's a

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,279
different problem but we want to run

00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,110
this to our full course because the

00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,269
thing is let's say you kickoff your

00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,210
incident response process and you

00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:28,529
realize this actually wasn't an incident

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:31,169
what's the worst thing that happens you

00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:33,809
got practice at doing incident response

00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:36,059
the more that we do this the better we

00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:37,909
get at it practice makes permanent but

00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,379
we're also creating that risk that

00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:42,570
Association and part of the reason this

00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:44,429
is really important is because to be

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,289
quite frankly the world of alcohol we

00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:49,889
live in now is not nearly as shitty as

00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:52,110
it was 15 years ago 10 15 years ago when

00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:53,490
when I was on call as a sysadmin I was

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,860
responding to incidents every other

00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,870
night and they were it was a constant

00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,549
thing I always did because I was also

00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,379
one of the only people and I was on call

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:03,090
every other week well now we have these

00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:05,220
beautiful things where we're on call for

00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,769
our own stuff and we're part of these

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,179
large rotations and maybe you might be

00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:11,820
on call you might get called into an

00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:13,500
incident once every three months right

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,000
so what you don't want to be doing is

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,320
during that time being going well how do

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,879
I even log into our Incident Response

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,860
software anymore I don't remember how to

00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:21,600
do this anymore right it's this anomaly

00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:25,420
for creating it as something we do all

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,730
the time it's just business as usual

00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,200
and we need to process this failure

00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:32,020
right so we talked a lot about

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,280
blamelessness blameless post-mortems the

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,980
whole thing is we need to follow the

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,360
failure and the outage through with all

00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,190
the information that we have and it

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,660
needs to have a conclusion right

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,840
otherwise it's the same thing as

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,950
unprocessed trauma so we we need to with

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,410
trauma we need to integrate our

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,600
experiences in our coherent whole with

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,850
post Instant reviews and post mortems

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,740
this includes this idea of we're telling

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,290
the story so the idea of a post mortem

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,240
is not a hundred percent just to create

00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:00,460
a bunch of JIRA tickets out of that it's

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,950
how do we actually share the story how

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,960
do we actually process it and then it

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,790
comes to and this this gets us into this

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,580
model of being able to actually learn

00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:11,290
more from incidents write a write only

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,559
post-mortem doesn't help anybody there's

00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,850
another way I like to put it so normally

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,290
this is the time I would start talking

00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,840
about cognitive distortions but I'm

00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,610
running out of time so we can if we want

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,120
to talk about the psychobabble some more

00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:27,850
we can do that offline but really the

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,549
couple things I want to to kind of end

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:32,890
with thinking about is I really love

00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:35,470
this quote from dr. Levine right which

00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:38,620
says resilient strength is the opposite

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:41,860
of helplessness being resilient as a

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,720
person means that we don't see things

00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,419
from the perspective of things that

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,640
happen to us it's a matter of what we

00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,410
can do going forward right and as an

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,720
organization it's the same thing

00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:55,299
incidents happen but what do we do going

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,090
forward how do we learn from them and a

00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:59,770
culture of blame leads to a culture of

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,750
helplessness and that's the worst place

00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,880
we want to be we don't want to feel like

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,290
in our organization in our team we are

00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,809
helpless and we cannot make things

00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:11,220
better and being able to move forward

00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:14,650
past that stuff is really what's key so

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,000
I've got a bunch of supporting links if

00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,190
you want to learn more about this stuff

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,580
on my speaking website as well as the

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:24,850
slides and all this great stuff so thank

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:29,100
you for having me and I hope you enjoy

00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:31,160
the rest of my mom's days Tel Aviv

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,160
you

00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,039
