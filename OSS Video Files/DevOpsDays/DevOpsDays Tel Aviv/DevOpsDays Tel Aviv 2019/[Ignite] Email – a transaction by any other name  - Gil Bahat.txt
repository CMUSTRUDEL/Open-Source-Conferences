Publication date: 2020-01-12
Playlist: DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2019
Description: 
	This lightning talk will discuss how emails differ and how they relate to other types of transactions. We will dispel a few myths regarding how email placement operates and learn what we can do to monitor delivery and assure quality of service, as with any other transaction type.

00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:10,170
okay so it's for the DevOps audience I'm

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,639
gonna start with web transaction that we

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,139
all know and love so we've all been

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,540
there we've done that we've got the

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,449
t-shirts swimming you're totally

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,760
familiar with these but when it comes to

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,920
email it's crickets they don't look

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,990
quite like crickets but let's all take a

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,480
moment of silence to appreciate how much

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,960
we don't know about emails even within

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,899
the five minutes go right nobody almost

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,300
nobody knows anything about it why it's

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,309
like it's considered a dark arts

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,040
no one's true responsibility it's a

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,100
trance very blaming the provider but I

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,890
have the best industry practices carved

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,140
up just for you doesn't do anything

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,989
let's solve it by not monitoring it's

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,520
out of sight it's out of mind because

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,250
just because you can't get a quick

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,250
dashboard it's like oh it's someone

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,620
else's problem yeah so basically it's

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,320
you need to achieve your own visibility

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,350
which takes effort so that's why people

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,729
it's easy to just drop out of sight but

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,220
that's what's also it's considered hard

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,040
it's like oh no it's different than HTTP

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,740
it's it's speculative by nature will

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,240
never see everything and that makes it

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,479
it's not that hard

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,340
still Wow okay if a neighbor fails to

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,100
deliver when no one is watching it's

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,530
basically how we do things regularly if

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,049
something goes to spam we'll never see

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,600
it we have to operate speculatively it's

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,150
a bit of a mind change but when we set

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,030
up to that we've done our first step

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,130
importance journey stuff on the journey

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,460
so what can we see what do we get

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,950
feedback on we have bounced messages we

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,869
have click and open rates it's not I

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,119
think it's just a little bit we have to

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,790
keep in mind that it's a little bit it's

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,430
not the whole picture at all and from

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,710
the other side we have died the courtesy

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,540
of the provider they are willing to tell

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,149
us something about what's really

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,430
happening it's just very very coarse

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,280
grain you're not gotta tell us this

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,950
email fella says something is generally

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,730
bad or you're doing relatively good

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,879
still

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:19,090
again it's hard to work with but not

00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,700
impossible at all so let's see let's

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:25,269
consider what does affect deliverability

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:28,930
that we need to speculate with so the

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:31,269
technical factors the SPF never heard of

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,640
that they don't matter as much as people

00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,680
think they matter quite little actually

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,010
otherwise spammers who's just bankroll

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,640
the way to the to your inbox what really

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,989
matters is things like consent and

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,340
engagement there was a very dirty word

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:51,069
in the tech world and another thing that

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:54,129
also comes up is reputation reputation

00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:56,349
is also it's it's not it's not deep

00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,819
problem it's just the indicator the

00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:00,879
problem is that you're doing something

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,489
wrong with your consent and with your

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,430
with what you actually send it's not

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:09,160
that you're just your reputation is low

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,319
and when it comes to that apologies

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,769
determination man we're not usually

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,180
trained to handle this kind of stuff

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:19,180
we're trained to handle discreet stuff

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,190
we're trained to handle developers and

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,919
not the product owners which usually

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:27,220
send out emails so what do we do how do

00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,500
we approach that and half the way to

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,250
getting through to the real thing is

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,250
segmenting

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,829
we said that we need to consider consent

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,799
in engagement let's divide our crowds

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:41,530
and see what kind of consent we have

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,810
from a group of people and what kind of

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,340
engagement we have from a group of

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,000
people then we can start to consider

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,910
things like monitoring and things like

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,950
that how to segment we need to cement by

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:57,730
the recipient lifecycle is this a new

00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,680
user is this a lapsed user how far

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,810
engaged are they and we need to make

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,250
sure that the messaging that's the email

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,280
type the messaging that we are sending

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,739
to these specific users is right so it's

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,629
not our domain but we need to monitor it

00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:13,540
and reflect it to the owners of the

00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:16,120
emails that's and those are the key

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,359
ideas the key concept is just very

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,090
simple garbage in garbage out if your

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,770
email lists are garbage then not but is

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,950
going to help you need to pick your

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,140
recipients correctly you need to

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,630
sitter who am i sending do I have the

00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,030
right emails for them and we need to

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,710
consider timing if we send stuff too

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,410
early to people before they even

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,170
completed our onboarding it's way too

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,850
early if we forgot about them for a year

00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,830
and then we tell them hey your facebook

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,790
friend has joined our out then it's way

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,010
too late and just wrong and we need to

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,440
monitor for that too and of course and

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,510
that's the other key the most important

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,880
thing is garbage messaging nothing's

00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:00,060
gonna help you to actually push spam I

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,680
mean you can do it that's this talk and

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,290
you need to make sure that you're doing

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,790
things right and the important thing to

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,610
consider when you're looking for DevOps

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,560
perspective is that it's not just hours

00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,840
it's more like a relationship with a

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,360
developer when your developer is the

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,670
product managers on the others you need

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,400
to get those on board and you need to

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:24,210
pick them in the loop and give them the

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,770
your data and tying it all together how

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,950
to show them your data you need to

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,290
collect the data from the consoles from

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,210
clicking open rates and you need to make

00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,010
sure it's done for all your email

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,350
strings otherwise your reputations can

00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,420
hurt so we need to track the changes and

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,640
then behave just like a deployment and

00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,140
the last thing is that you can debug

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,550
just like you troubleshoot your

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,950
production environment

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,800
best practices for that thank you very

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,899
much

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,899
[Applause]
