Description: 
	Monitoring services is easy, right? Set up a notification that goes out when a certain number increases past a certain threshold to let you know that there’s a problem. But if that’s the case, why are so many teams drowning in alerts and dreading their time on call? The reason is that we tend to monitor the wrong things: reactive alerts, metrics that we don’t completely understand how they impact our service, and capacity alerts. We look at our own view of the service and fail to consider that our customers have a different view.

Come learn to let go of what does not help, and explore how to monitor for what truly matters: what the customer sees. This starts with defining our agreements with our customers, continues through building applications intelligently and instrumenting all the things, and finishes with picking the right signals out of that instrumentation to generate alerts that are actionable, not ones that introduce confusion and noise. We will also touch on capacity planning, and how it should never wake you up. You’ll find it’s possible to assure that you meet your service level objectives while still maximizing your sleep level objectives.
