00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:11,460
so I want to talk about how to build a

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:15,900
community and like really what I want

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,210
you to do is do something as amazing as

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,170
the volunteer organizers that brought

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:26,279
you this conference maybe maybe a little

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,769
bit of background so you you can believe

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,369
like to build my credentials so I you

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:35,899
may have seen me at the GCP table and

00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:38,790
yes Google are sponsoring but in my

00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,870
outside of my job I actually spent my

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,110
nights and weekends

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,079
with the London tech community in

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,940
various ways so I'm I'm a serious meetup

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,100
addict so I will usually go to meet up

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,160
every single night and London has a lot

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,079
of them but I am also an organizer so

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,210
I'm a co-founder of high data London

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,640
which is one of the biggest tech meetup

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,680
groups on the planet we have ten

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,699
thousand six hundred members we've run

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,309
61 meetups

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,549
we've run six conferences and we've had

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,700
a grand total of over eighteen thousand

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,549
attendees at our events and I've been

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,380
doing that for more than five years now

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:23,430
I also used to be a organizer for a

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,869
Google developers group before my Google

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,259
job because as a Google I can't be

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:33,470
because it's a community thing and also

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:36,960
I am a host for code bar which is a

00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,500
community that teaches code coaches

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,049
underrepresented folks in tech in coding

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,610
and so I'm telling you this not because

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,040
I want to brag but because I want to

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,329
convince you that I have some relevant

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,530
experience that hopefully you can

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:56,790
benefit from so yeah what I want you to

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,520
to do is is be one of be one of us like

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,060
be one of those people that give up

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,520
their their spare time to make tech

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,030
communities awesome and I want to give

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,679
you some pointers where to start so what

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,659
what I would tell you is if you want to

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,260
start a new community

00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:19,230
you should start from somewhere that you

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,700
are very passionate about and that you

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,189
really care about which doesn't mean

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,249
that you need you can expert in it you

00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:28,499
just need to know people who know things

00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:34,200
about this area so you can find people

00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:36,719
that that speak they can speak and yeah

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,019
you need to like find your niche so

00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,760
don't don't go for the for the topic

00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,319
that you think will be most popular but

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,049
like go for the one that you care most

00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:49,290
about because it's a lot of work and and

00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:51,120
you want to enjoy it as well so and you

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,310
can't you can't go it alone so you need

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,189
a strong team and you need a diverse

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,519
team because the more diverse your team

00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:02,250
is the more speakers you can find and

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,030
therefore the more diverse attendees you

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,579
can attract as well which which is very

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,459
important like everybody wins yeah so

00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:14,760
don't don't think about doing it alone

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,040
even don't even start by yourself not

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,569
even for your first event because you do

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,519
need it's a lot of work you do need

00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:24,090
people to share the load but you also

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:29,879
need people to bounce off ideas because

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:31,590
you may be you may be smart but it's

00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,199
always good to get a second opinion

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,930
so yes start start by building the team

00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,389
and once you've done that you need

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,540
somewhere to to actually host the event

00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:44,909
so you need a venue and likely your

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,699
attendees will expect food and drinks

00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:50,699
and all that that we've come to expect

00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:53,069
in our field so you will probably also

00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,319
need someone to pay for that they can be

00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:57,540
one of the same so it's actually quite

00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,159
likely that having your host you'll also

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,079
be the sponsor actually simplifies a lot

00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,900
of things because if they if they pay

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,449
for the food they can know money needs

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,060
to change hand so tell that makes it a

00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:12,509
lot easier and also try to get buy-in

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,370
from from your manager so maybe your

00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:16,709
company actually can be your sponsor and

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,370
your host which makes it a lot easier

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:23,909
but otherwise leverage your network you

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,039
also want to build a funnel of content

00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:26,520
essentially because you don't want to be

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:29,849
in the city

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,620
version that you start strong and like

00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:35,789
have a bunch of great events but then

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:38,639
you run out of steam so build like have

00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:41,069
a heaven CFP process have a way for

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,699
people to suggest talks line them up

00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:48,539
ideally months in advance that makes it

00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:52,220
all a lot easier and if people know how

00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:57,690
they can suggest talks then they will so

00:04:52,220 --> 00:05:01,949
set that up and also it's it's important

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:03,720
to be consistent so don't don't don't

00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,970
run like a lot of events but then run

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,349
off steam better spread spaced them out

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:12,270
so you can make it sustainable and

00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:15,479
finally create a safe and inclusive

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,849
space for everyone that's very important

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,979
have a code of conduct I repeat you must

00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:22,380
have a code of conduct this is not

00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:26,069
negotiable I can tell you from

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:30,000
experience that if you don't then then

00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:31,590
it it's a problem so yeah start with

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,659
your passion don't go it alone build a

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,599
sustainable funnel to for the long run

00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:37,720
be inclusive and go and do something

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:45,729
great thank you

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:45,729
[Applause]

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,080
