Title: [Spotlight Talk] 50 Years After: Resiliency Lessons from Apollo Missions to the Moon - Robert Barron
Publication date: 2020-01-12
Playlist: DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2019
Description: 
	July 2019 marked 50 years since the first humans set foot on the moon.

Moments before the historic landing of Apollo 11, the spacecraft computer started throwing errors and basically restarting every few seconds. The astronauts and mission control had to make split-second decisions and trust in the resiliency and reliability of the systems.

There are many lessons that can be learned from NASA's efforts and in this session I will present a selection of lessons in the domains of resilience, reliability, performance and availability.

After each mission, all the problems that occurred were collected as Flight Anomalies. They were then analyzed, causes were found and remediation was prepared so the problems would never recur.

In this session I will present a number of stories about Flight Anomalies from the Apollo era and explain their relevance, as learning stories for the modern era of computing.

These anecdotes will also include both software (rebooting computer) and hardware issues (the Instrument Unit, the computer brain of the Saturn V rocket, survived a lightning strike during launch!).

[Music]

00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,240
thank you very much I'm very pleased to

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,429
be here I've enjoyed the last two days

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,150
tremendously I think everyone here has

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:18,750
and thank you for for staying or all the

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,359
way my name is Robert Bell and I work

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,650
for a small company called IBM I think

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,650
most of you have heard of it

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,230
iBM has a long rich tradition and very

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,719
proud of the fact that IBM was one

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,809
percent of the people who worked on the

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,540
Apollo moon missions what we're going to

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,460
be talking about now is in honor of the

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,640
50th anniversary of the moon landing

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,520
July 20th 1969 are some of the

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,399
operational and resilience lessons that

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,579
we learned during the chop to the moon

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,680
and back and how these lessons while

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,760
they were relevant in the 60s are just

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,090
as relevant in the 2019 and 2020 s to

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,659
come we're going to start in the

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,010
beginning middle of the Cold War John

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,710
Kennedy the young President of the

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,020
United States announces that America is

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,600
going to win the space ice within a

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,000
decade they're going to get to the moon

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,979
bring him back show everyone that the

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,259
American technological prowess is the

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:26,070
greatest and that the American spirit

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,920
can do anything now the very first

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,020
lesson is that Kennedy gave us explicit

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,420
goals while it sounded like science

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,590
fiction it was actually very simple to

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:41,040
understand and comprehend man moon

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:43,500
decade safe that's it you do all these

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,710
four things you've succeeded you do

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,170
three of them maybe you land a space

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,860
probe on the moon it's not good enough

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,899
maybe you do it in 1973 it's not good

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,270
enough you have to do all of them and

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,299
it's very easy now to understand what

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,670
victory what success is so many of us

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,009
work on technical projects that we know

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,299
what technically we want to do but

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,459
whether it's good for the business

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,520
whether the business wants us to do that

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,430
is not always clear

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,960
which brings us to the next point even

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,630
though we have the goals we have to be

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,750
unified amongst them so we want to get

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,910
to the moon what does that mean as the

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,730
spacecraft landing on the moon mean we

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,550
got to the moon or do we have to open

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,010
the door get out and put a step on the

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,350
moon so let's have a show of hands who

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:37,580
thinks that landing the spacecraft means

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:39,770
we got to the moon okay

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,850
who thinks that stepping on to the moon

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:46,010
means we actually succeed okay so what I

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:49,040
can see is that most people would say

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,620
that stepping on to the moon is the

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,900
important part so let's ask the person

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:58,010
who should know the most about it Neil

00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:01,490
Armstrong what he thinks a Neil

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:05,330
Armstrong is a pilot he doesn't care

00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:08,120
about walkin he cares about flying and

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,180
he cares about landing so we've got the

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,830
greatest technical person here but he

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,010
has a slightly different view of what

00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,800
the business wants compared to the

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,840
actual business so that's another

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,720
important lesson let the technical

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,370
people do everything but make sure that

00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,210
they're doing it in the right direction

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,610
for the business and of course let's not

00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:34,190
forget in all this discussion of what is

00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,620
landing on the moon that is only part of

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,819
it we have to get all the way back in

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:43,540
order to succeed

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:45,489
so if we ask an engineer in the 50s and

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,790
the 60s when they're working on it if we

00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:50,769
ask a child today if we ask virtually

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,110
anyone how should we get to the moon

00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,640
most likely they'll talk about something

00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,760
that looks like this

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,190
a big locket that takes off goes all the

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,920
way to the moon lands people walk around

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:07,150
get back in the rocket and come back

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:11,230
this is a joke of science fiction from

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:14,319
everything from Tintin to the Millennium

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:18,280
Falcon we have a ship that takes us all

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,040
the way in technological terms we might

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,139
call this the monolith the one thing

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,760
that does everything but there's a big

00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:27,610
problem with this monolith going to the

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,340
moon and you can see that we've carried

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,690
the fuel tank we've carried the engines

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,060
we've carried all sorts of things that

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,840
we don't need all the way to the moon

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:42,310
and all the way back and this is a big

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,830
waste so when the NASA engineers started

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,190
designing this simple solution which

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:51,460
they called direct ascent they saw that

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:55,000
it would be too expensive it would take

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,479
too long it would be too difficult to

00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,520
achieve and they went on to say no we

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,039
need to split it up we're going to have

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,990
a medium-sized spacecraft that will take

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,300
us to the moon and the teeny tiny

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,720
spacecraft there will only take two

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,990
astronauts from orbit around the moon to

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,389
the moon itself let's look at how this

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,539
is going to gonna work we're going to

00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:22,900
take off from from Earth with a big 110

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:25,990
meter tall rocket as the rocket goes up

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,630
as it empties its fuel tanks it drops

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,720
away the unnecessary parts getting

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:35,110
lighter and lighter as it flies we get

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,750
into orbit around the Earth and the top

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,660
20 meters which have the two spacecraft

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,669
the medium and the small come out of

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:46,690
their protective shells they do little

00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:49,510
ballet to link up and then they go off

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,280
to the moon we started with 110 meters

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,940
we've got a

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,010
20 meters going to the moon we get to

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,840
the moon and the humans go from the

00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,780
medium spacecraft to the small

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,320
spacecraft separate while they're

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:08,190
spinning around the moon and land on the

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,560
moon land on the moon have a walk do

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:14,490
what we want to do and then we take off

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,830
but again we've got this spacecraft not

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,900
everything is going to go up we're going

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,810
to split in half again so we've got any

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,800
of us small a tiny little spacecraft

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:28,800
which goes up we link up again we turn

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,080
around and we go back to earth once we

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,090
get to earth even this medium spacecraft

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,860
is going to split up again because we

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,650
don't need a heat shield which is very

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:42,150
heavy to get all the way back to earth

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:44,729
for this now empty fuel of tank tank of

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:49,350
fuel and they would go into the Earth's

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:51,630
atmosphere parachute and land on the

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:55,220
ocean we started with a hundred and ten

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:58,020
meters we end up with less than three

00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,660
but we went all the way to the moon and

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:04,280
back in the cheapest way in the fastest

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:08,400
way and the most achievable way possible

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:11,280
and depending on the skill background

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,130
this diagram of all the stages that we

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:19,770
go through might remind you of a CI CT

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:23,520
pipeline it might remind you of a

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:26,669
transaction that you're chasing and all

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,919
these things are children because what

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:31,190
we said was in silver monolith we're

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,200
going to have a series of microservices

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,990
each one is going to do exactly what it

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:41,729
needs to do one job one vote and we'll

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:43,800
discard it when we finish by that or it

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:45,630
can be a CI C D pipeline we will trying

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,360
to get through and doing various tests

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:52,140
along the way and only if we achieve one

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,200
step we're gonna get to get there so

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:57,330
this is much more complicated than just

00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,280
having one big locket that will go from

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,680
one place to another just like a

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,820
distributed micro-service architecture

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,370
is more complicated than a monolith

00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,640
but the fact is that the monolith is too

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,590
difficult to achieve it's too expensive

00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:16,780
and this is something that we can take

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:18,610
bite-sized pieces and do so now that we

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,920
know that we what we want to do and we

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,290
know how we want to do it we've got to

00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,750
do it and we're not going to start off

00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:29,530
with getting to the moon we need to

00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:32,500
start off with agile development Minimum

00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:34,330
Viable products step by step proving

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,970
everything we need to be able to prove

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,560
so we know we can get to the moon so the

00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:42,610
first thing the Americans tried to do

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:46,060
with Mercury was the MVP was be the

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,990
first human in space that failed because

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:52,980
the Russians got there first

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:55,690
but they continued with this project and

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,850
the first American in space first

00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,150
America over the earth and even more

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:04,420
importantly how do I operate a

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,800
spacecraft from the earth the spacecraft

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,010
is flying too fast

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,480
the spacecraft is changing too often for

00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,700
the astronaut to be able to control

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,800
everything if there's an emergency if

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,480
something unexpected happens he doesn't

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,460
have the reflex he doesn't have the

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,500
documentation available he doesn't know

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,250
how to solve the problem himself so we

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,740
need Mission Control in Houston to watch

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,470
over him and solve the problem and if

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,890
this sounds to you like instrumentation

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:37,030
knock observability well you're right

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:40,300
it's exactly that and that's what they

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:44,560
learned from this first project the

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:48,670
second project with Gemini project was

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,270
had two people in space walking in space

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,650
staying for two weeks in space

00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,590
spacecraft pillow eating around each

00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:59,020
other in space all the various discrete

00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:02,110
things they needed to learn how to do in

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:05,350
order to get to the moon again MVP

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:08,440
follows MVP test follows test success

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,630
follows success failure follows learning

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:16,140
from the failure and a success

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:18,300
and how did they train for this how did

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,970
they practice because sending something

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,630
into space is very expensive so they

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,640
both simulators if you see this computer

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,040
and behind the computer is a

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,280
strange-looking box with astronauts

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,580
would sit in the box and pretend to fly

00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,840
to the moon and they would pretend and

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,060
they would pretend and they would

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,280
pretend and train and for every hour

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,710
they spent in space they would probably

00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,500
practice for at least a hundred hours on

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,330
the ground trying different combinations

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,370
of things seeing what happens when

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,850
there's a failure what are the responses

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,320
that we have for failure and they didn't

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:59,550
do it by themselves because the

00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,230
operators were training with them to see

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,050
exactly what how the astronauts was

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,180
funded to see what happens when it when

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,830
unexpected things happen and how do they

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:12,480
work together to solve these problems

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:14,700
and simulated telemetry and simulated

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,800
dashboards because obviously they

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,600
weren't flying at the speed they were

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,790
flying they were stuck in a small room

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,130
in Houston but the computers were

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,230
simulating what it would look like while

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:27,120
they were flying so the operators could

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,040
practice what the numbers were supposed

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,590
to look like if this sounds like

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,810
building a baseline for anomaly

00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:37,140
detection well you're absolutely like

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:41,370
that's what it is they even went so far

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:43,520
as building plaster models of the moon

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,110
where you had the camera taking

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,610
photographing the moon showing it to the

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,960
astronauts through their window in a

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,440
television screen and when the

00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,330
astronauts moved the simulation the

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,970
camera would move at the same time and

00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:00,900
show them how they were flying over the

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:02,460
moon so that essentially when it came to

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,200
landing on the moon it should be as

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:09,030
familiar to them as driving home

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,710
everything was documented all the

00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,470
various procedures all the possible

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:22,080
failures documented and documented and

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:22,540
documented and typed out and punted this

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,190
is a

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:29,980
and showing what the flight plan is

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:33,790
supposed to be hey this is an

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:37,510
hour-by-hour description of a perfect

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,910
flight all the problem-solving when

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,680
other documents and it said that the

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:46,000
documentation to get to the moon

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,800
is piled up page by page would nearly

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,840
take us all the way to the moon just by

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,660
itself

00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:56,500
and it's not just the people on earth

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,450
the astronauts had special booklets

00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,180
printed for them that they would stick

00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,880
on their arm and was special paper that

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,950
they could turn with us with big special

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,660
gloves so they could see exactly what

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:11,350
they were supposed to do when they were

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,330
supposed to do it so on the one hand we

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,910
had we have the chaos of the testing

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,610
chaos engineering is not something that

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:21,670
requires virtual service to stop and

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:24,280
restart but they did it back then but on

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,750
the other hand order because we need to

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,940
know what the solutions are we need to

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,250
document them so that once we've solved

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:36,580
the problem we know what happens next

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:39,700
time so we've done all our MVPs we've

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,290
practiced all the way we have all our

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,530
routines we know what we're going to do

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:50,320
and we're flying to the moon and just

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:53,850
before we land the computer reboots so

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,610
how do they solve this problem

00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:00,730
so the Apollo

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:04,290
juda does three things it collects

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:07,510
information from the various sensors

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,490
which tell the computer how fast it's

00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,959
flying where it's flying radar things

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:17,820
like that shows the information to the

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:22,450
astronauts in this very high-resolution

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:24,670
super screen with so many buttons and

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:28,510
it's not a touchscreen but it's just as

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:31,660
good and when the astronauts press these

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,070
buttons it controls the Jets in order to

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,810
change the direction that we're flying

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:41,670
so as you can see this computer is

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:44,230
somewhat important for the landing and

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,510
they're hovering a few hundred meters

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:50,160
above the ground minutes before the

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:53,769
scheduled landing and they get an error

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,820
and this is a very hooter here doesn't

00:14:53,769 --> 00:15:00,160
know what one 2:01 means and what I want

00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,709
- OH - because it's flashing again and

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,490
again now the astronauts have practiced

00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:08,199
and trained for hundreds of hours but

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,079
there were some things that they hadn't

00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:13,060
practiced on and these errors which they

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:15,459
knew meant that something was bad in the

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,579
internals of the computer but they

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:21,250
didn't know what was going on so for

00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:26,949
that they needed support for Mission

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:30,339
Control most of you I think are familiar

00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:32,890
with the sort of the sort of picture

00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,180
Mission Control in Houston or for you

00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,480
those of you working in large

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:40,360
organizations the data center NOC

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,820
because they look very similar people

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,949
working monitoring seeing what's going

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,230
on seeing the health of the systems that

00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:49,209
they're responsible for each person in a

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:54,730
different station each person has a

00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:55,100
different responsibility and if we look

00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,700
at the

00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:01,730
abilities of the computer alarm what

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,980
happens is that the alarm appears in the

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,620
astronauts console one-and-a-half

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:11,180
seconds later it appears in the

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,920
telemetry and dashboards of the of the

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,660
guidance officer and the guidance

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,520
officers back home so the guidance

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,940
office is the guy sitting in the central

00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,140
room

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,640
he's the point man first level support

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:26,360
sre on duty however you want to describe

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,670
it and the back room are his experts the

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,580
people who support him he doesn't have

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,140
space here for the whole library of

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,180
documentation because back then they

00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,010
didn't have Wikipedia they didn't have

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,250
confluence they didn't even have the

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:45,260
World Wide Web so all the documentation

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:47,780
was physically printed so the astronauts

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:51,050
could talk to the capsule communicator

00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:53,180
who had a special seat yeah and only to

00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,760
the capsule communicator they didn't

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,590
want to allow other people to distort

00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,140
and disrupt and interfere with

00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:03,320
astronauts were doing and the guidance

00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:05,330
officer talks to his back room and we

00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,190
have other controllers each of which are

00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,660
responsible for a different aspect of

00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,850
the spacecraft

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,600
maybe the flight engines maybe the

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:16,640
battery control maybe the telescope's or

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,730
whatever and they have their own back

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,670
rooms and orchestrating it in the middle

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:26,030
is the flight director who has the final

00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,830
say over what goes on during the mission

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,860
and he's the one who's in order and

00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:35,090
abort you remotely even without the

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:37,190
astronauts doing anything now all these

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,260
things are people talking to each other

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:43,780
they're not necessarily next to each

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:47,000
other they have a distributed team and

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:50,240
and what I found is that not only do

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,010
they talk within these boxes but they

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,930
talk between themselves

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:56,000
maybe this back who needs to talk to

00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,280
that back room maybe the flight needs to

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,970
talk to a controller outside a lot of

00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:05,210
networking going on and back then they

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:08,150
didn't have slack or matter most or

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,670
Microsoft teams all they had were

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:13,100
headsets and they talk to each other

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,590
with headsets so we still have headsets

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:19,370
and we use them we don't have cigars any

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:21,380
more rarely in where we're working but a

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,540
lot of the things that we do today

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,930
during incident management they were

00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,400
trying to do back then with their

00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:31,040
headsets they would have multiple

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,620
conversations at the same time and every

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,750
operator could choose which conversation

00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:40,070
which loop they were going to listen in

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:41,600
on and this is a diagram of this

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,160
everything was stored everything was

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,620
recorded if you're on the internet and

00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,570
listen to the conversations that they

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:51,110
had and you can see here there was

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:53,060
something like 20 conversations going on

00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,680
at the same time and what they would do

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,870
was they would change the volume of

00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,550
every conversation they were interested

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,710
in so the ones they were directly

00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:02,270
responsible for had the highest volume

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,060
and once they were just somewhat

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:07,640
interesting had a lower volume so that

00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,130
they would that would was how they would

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:14,630
make things more or less obvious to

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:16,430
themselves and so what happened in this

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,680
conversation was that the guidance

00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:21,710
officers guidance office was talking to

00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:24,470
his back room and the baculum guy

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,900
actually knew what one 2:01 meant

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,210
because he had studied and prepared and

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,640
practiced and simulated and promoted and

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:34,030
documented and obviously one two or one

00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,670
means execution overflow vacancies

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:41,770
obviously and 1 to 2 means execution

00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:46,100
overflow jobs completely different thing

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:47,630
so this doesn't help us that much we

00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,270
know that there's an error we know that

00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,400
is internal error should we abort the

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:55,520
computer is reap well what we know is

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,670
that this is similar to memory exception

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,410
out of memory out of CPU and this is a

00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:04,010
real-time computer running out of memory

00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:07,760
it reboots does this mean we need to

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:10,940
abort computer is rebooting so

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,370
fortunately they prepared even for this

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,680
and they had a flight plan and they knew

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,700
where the spacecraft was supposed to be

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,500
at any minute

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,929
during the flight

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,179
and they knew what speed it should have

00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:25,340
and when they compared the actual

00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:28,700
position of a spacecraft with the plan

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:32,150
they saw that despite the reboots it was

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:34,159
still flying ok so if we look at the

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,559
golden signals really usually talking

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,360
about latency traffic errors things like

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,730
that they were looking at speed

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,919
Direction angle and stability of flight

00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,330
and they said okay the computers are

00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:47,270
rebooting rebooting

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:50,720
but it's so between reboots it's flying

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:53,419
ok so let's take a chance we're not

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:59,030
going to abort canceling the mission as

00:20:53,419 --> 00:21:02,210
long as the golden signals ok just like

00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,740
if a company if we've got a virtual

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,510
machine of rebooting in the middle of

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,159
the night we are not going to page

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:10,100
someone up and wake them up at 2:00 a.m.

00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:13,250
if one computer goes down but the

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,770
service is still available so the lesson

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,720
here is we do want to monitor as much as

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,549
we can but we're going to take action

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,299
only on things that we know are

00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:26,780
important but it took a lot of nerve to

00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:37,250
say let's go on despite the rebooting

00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:39,950
computer and we had a successful CI CD

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,690
deployment or we had a successful

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,890
transaction depending on your point of

00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:49,760
view but they took the risks they took

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:51,740
the chance they got to the moon and they

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:57,590
got back and got a New York ticket a

00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:59,090
polite but going once is not enough we

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,580
want to be sure that we can do this

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:06,370
sustainably and the very next mission

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:08,960
November 1969 just over 50 years ago

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,760
started off very well for the first 36

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,580
and a half seconds it was a perfect

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:17,780
mission and then lightning struck the

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:19,190
rocket you don't need to be a NASA

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,020
engineer to know that this is an

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:26,330
unplanned and unwelcome occurrence

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:29,690
spacecraft overloaded and basically the

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:31,779
whole power Network went down in this in

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,269
the Apollo spacecraft

00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:38,969
and when it tried the emergency

00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:42,639
batteries hooked up they started getting

00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:44,019
metrics which made no sense will they

00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:47,739
were getting tell they were getting

00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:49,869
angles that were beyond 360 degrees they

00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:53,349
were getting negative amounts of fuel in

00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:55,059
the fuel tanks they were blind the

00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:57,219
astronauts were just seeing all these

00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:01,119
alarms going off and the people on the

00:22:57,219 --> 00:23:02,879
ground were seeing garbage so how can we

00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:07,299
solve the problems

00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:09,909
fortunately one man John Aron had seen

00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:12,999
this sort of thing before a year earlier

00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:15,960
during a practice in Houston there had

00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:17,889
been a power failure in the building and

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,239
when there's a power failure in the

00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:21,039
building you say okay we're going to

00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:23,229
cancel the training till we fix the

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,710
power everyone can go home except for

00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:28,269
the electricians and when during the

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,820
power failure he saw these strange

00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:32,859
patterns and he didn't go home he said

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,629
why am I seeing these patterns yeah why

00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:36,460
am I seeing this garbage information I

00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:39,639
should not be seeing it it doesn't make

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:42,669
sense so he took the schematics of his

00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:44,349
console and he started talking to the

00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:46,149
people from the simulation and he

00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:49,539
started talking to the people from the

00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:51,969
power in the Bowden why are we seeing

00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:54,029
this unusual information and they didn't

00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:56,529
tell him this isn't your responsibility

00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:59,379
stick out of it they said oh that's

00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:00,969
interesting let's find out and they

00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:03,729
discovered there was a small little

00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:07,029
component that was translating the

00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:09,999
analog measurements to digital

00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:13,239
information translating the via the

00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:15,339
physical reality to what they see on

00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:17,859
their consoles and if this sounds a

00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:21,190
little bit like IOT to you that's

00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:22,960
because it is and they saw that the

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:26,259
component that were responsible for this

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,929
translation after the emergency

00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:31,659
batteries went up didn't function partly

00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:32,169
and they needed to switch it into an

00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:35,379
auxilary

00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:38,619
position and he said gee the power

00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:41,769
failure on earth gave me the same result

00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:45,220
as the lightning strike on the way to

00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:47,109
the moon maybe the same was out

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:51,909
maybe the same action will give me the

00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:55,119
same without this is a panel on the

00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:58,419
Apollo spacecraft there are few buttons

00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:01,929
yeah there are about six panels like

00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:04,570
this in the spacecraft and as you can

00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:06,429
see this button here for the signal

00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,789
conditioning equipment which is the

00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:12,879
component in that were talking about is

00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:15,489
it's it's Falcon Center actually yeah

00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:17,470
most people didn't even know that this

00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:19,720
component existed let alone where the

00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,669
button was but he did and one of the

00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,109
astronauts did and they pressed the

00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:27,099
button and that saved the mission

00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:29,349
because they press the button and

00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:31,450
suddenly everyone was seeing the actual

00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:33,549
errors the errors that they could deal

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,279
with the error that they could save is

00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:38,109
that they could solve and they fix the

00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:43,960
things as it was as the rocket was

00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:45,700
flying up and got to the moon the thing

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,099
that makes a good economist a natural

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,340
curiosity about how things work even if

00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:52,659
you don't are not responsible for what

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:56,820
okay if that sounds like good advice

00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:56,820
today that's because it is

00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:05,889
so there were only 13 launches of the

00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,200
Saturn 5 rocket the 110 monster that

00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:10,119
took the Americans to the moon there was

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,429
no time to actually do all the

00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,529
statistical testing that the engineers

00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:17,109
wanted they had who maximized the

00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:19,239
reliability and we saw this reliability

00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:21,970
in the lightning strike while the Apollo

00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:24,909
space crafts computer and systems went

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:28,929
offline the rocket itself continued

00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:30,999
flying per plan and kept the system

00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:34,299
stable for the time it took John Aaron

00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:36,519
to figure out what the problem was and

00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:39,720
one of the reasons for this stability

00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:42,789
was the computer of the rocket itself

00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:46,779
there is a hundred and ten meter rocket

00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:48,580
and you can see here the computer of the

00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:50,799
rocket which is part of the rocket

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:56,200
itself and there are four IBM engineers

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:58,170
inside building the computer and the way

00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,090
this computer work as the commute

00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:03,030
responsible for the guidance and control

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:05,400
of the rocket itself the way it worked

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,980
was that the computer was split up the

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,160
algorithm was physically divided into

00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:14,280
seven modules and then these seven

00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,750
modules were duplicated three times and

00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,690
every time you went through the

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,280
algorithm module one would do its

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:23,280
calculation three times on three

00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,870
physical sections and then it'd be a

00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,480
vote for the next one

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:30,210
for the next one for the next one so the

00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:35,030
computers divided 21 times and you can

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:37,790
have something like 14 failures before

00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:42,270
the computer will actually malfunction

00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:45,240
and when we did the they did statistical

00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,800
testing for reliability of the computer

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,180
and we can see here a couple of

00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:55,800
interesting things first of all testing

00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:59,160
the reliability over time at 100 hours

00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:03,620
we only get two nines of reliability at

00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:08,820
500 hours will down to 97 reliability

00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:11,040
which is bad but remember this one

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:14,070
computer only needs to last as long as

00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,860
the launch so we're talking about 10

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,990
minutes 20 minutes of time before we

00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,950
don't need this Ark attend more so

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,910
suddenly two nines over a hundred hours

00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:27,570
doesn't sound so bad

00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:29,550
I assume this is from IBM documentation

00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:32,160
I can only assume that they couldn't run

00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:35,790
the tests for 10 minutes and get us the

00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,500
statistical reasonable is out another

00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,450
interesting thing here is if you look at

00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,950
the various components that they were

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:47,670
testing the logic and the physical

00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:49,980
memory and the power supply are actually

00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,560
all part of the same thing there's no

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,850
abstraction here they will used to

00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:58,410
thinking about software and hardware and

00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:02,760
front-end services and back-end services

00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:04,740
and middleware this page is actually the

00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,680
only page which has something which is

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,620
alien to us today this is so unlike

00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,240
kubernetes you thought you wouldn't hear

00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,910
kubernetes

00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,190
in this speech doesn't hear now this is

00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:18,320
so unlike the things that we'll used to

00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,540
considering where the hard way is

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,970
abstracted away the software should be

00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:26,660
in a mesh and completely not dependent

00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:28,880
on everything else but yeah some things

00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:34,250
have changed in the last 50 years and

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,900
changed for the good I think so we've

00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:40,130
landed on the moon we've done it a few

00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:42,500
times everything's very successful as a

00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:46,370
point of coincidence the last mission to

00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:50,140
land on the moon Apollo 17 splashed down

00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:52,490
back on earth on December 19th 1972

00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:57,100
exactly 47 years ago

00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,100
that's a nice coincidence for the speech

00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:05,540
before we finish there's a little bonus

00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:07,190
lesson there's always a question why did

00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,020
the Americans get to the moon before the

00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,300
Russians if you think about it the

00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,240
Russians started off much more strongly

00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:17,390
than the Americans first spacecraft in

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,410
space Sputnik 1 first dog first animal

00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,690
in space like her

00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:22,700
so it's man in space Yuri Gagarin first

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:25,130
woman in space valentina Tereshkova

00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,990
first time that two spacecraft flying at

00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:29,960
the same time so it's meant to walk in

00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:32,990
space first first first and at some

00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,809
point they stopped being first fell back

00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:38,750
and the Americans got into space got to

00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:40,910
the moon first so there are lots of

00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:42,740
reasons for us but one reason which is

00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,710
relevant to the way we work is the

00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,570
difference between a proof of concept

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,030
which is a technological test to see

00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:54,830
whether something is feasible and a

00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:57,890
Minimum Viable Product which is the

00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,580
smallest possible usable and business

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:03,230
valuable instance that you can create

00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:05,780
and if we consider what the Americans

00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:08,270
did with the various missions they were

00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,940
building MVP after MVP building on

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:13,429
successes if we look at the first

00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,740
generation American spacecraft Mercury

00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:19,010
and the first generation Soviet

00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,690
spacecraft Vostok these were each MVPs

00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,700
in their own light they did what they

00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,980
were supposed to do when they wanted to

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,740
get to the next level of MVPs the Amer

00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:33,080
seconds developed a brand new spacecraft

00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:36,169
called Gemini Russians didn't Voskhod is

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:39,980
just the old Vostok with a few more

00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:40,940
capabilities added on top a few POCs you

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,340
want to walk in space

00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,090
the Americans added doors to the

00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,660
spacecraft

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:49,730
the Russians added a hat just changed

00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,200
the shape of the hatch which meant that

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:53,240
even though they could could walk in

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,120
space they couldn't actually do anything

00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,860
useful with that they wanted to add more

00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,140
people to the spacecraft the Americans

00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:02,120
made a larger spacecraft the Russians

00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,980
told the cosmonauts to fly without

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:09,980
spacesuits so it could get more people

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:11,500
in the same space so by the time they

00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,520
wanted to go to the third generation

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,340
which is the one that would get to the

00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,150
moon the Americans simply went one two

00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,230
three

00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:23,630
the Russians went one one point one and

00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:26,059
then the jump two three was much more

00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:31,510
difficult and took much longer than they

00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:33,590
expected so the lessons we've learned

00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:37,160
there'll be a test at the end of this

00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:40,850
during happy hour explicit goals unified

00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,260
goals split monoliths blah blah blah

00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:45,290
blah right you can watch the video of

00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:48,590
this if you really want but the lessons

00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:50,330
of lessons the things that I really want

00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,340
you to remember which have nothing to do

00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,260
with the pilot but all to do with what

00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,240
we do day to day are that the more

00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,390
things change the more things stay the

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,429
same don't reinvent the wheel see what

00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:02,620
other people have done before you try to

00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:05,570
learn from them

00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,790
resilience availability observability

00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,070
everything I'm repeating things we've

00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:12,650
heard throughout this day but they'll

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:16,179
true it's not tools and technology it's

00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:19,070
humans processes practice and practice

00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:20,929
you have to have a best practice and you

00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,669
have to practice the best practice to

00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:25,700
make sure that you know how to do it

00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:27,919
properly and you have to have a good

00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,900
plan you don't have to stick to the plan

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,870
you have to know how to go beyond the

00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:35,210
plan when things go in an unexpected way

00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:37,760
but if you don't have a plan and you're

00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,600
just making up adapt along the way it's

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,600
even more difficult

00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:47,090
like to leave you with two quotations

00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:50,419
the first is Christopher Kraft a man who

00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:52,070
created Mission Control and out of all

00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:55,460
the things that were used in order to

00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:58,580
get to the moon the computer was the

00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,200
most important so I think that's that's

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,169
something for us to take a bit of credit

00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,479
in credit of the work we're doing change

00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:06,320
the world is changing the world and will

00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:09,169
change the world

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,049
and the second thing is that natural

00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:15,379
curiosity about things that are beyond

00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:20,329
your responsibility is it good way to be

00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:23,149
professional some further reading I've

00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:25,220
got a blog in which I write about these

00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:27,889
things some of the lessons I've

00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,599
discussed I go into more detail in my

00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:34,940
blog some of the things in my blog I

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:40,970
haven't discussed yet two books that are

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:43,190
fascinating about Mission Control Apollo

00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:45,950
in a real time is where you can listen

00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,869
in to the conversations during missions

00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,510
it's all recorded everything is recorded

00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:54,379
you can listen or jump to him

00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:57,109
interesting parts and if you have

00:34:54,379 --> 00:35:00,589
trouble sleeping at night can give you

00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:03,020
references to some of these some of

00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:05,900
these detailed study reports which have

00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:11,210
all the statistics of the reliability of

00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:12,550
the components so thank you very much in

00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:19,980
a great audience

00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:25,119
[Applause]

00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:25,119
