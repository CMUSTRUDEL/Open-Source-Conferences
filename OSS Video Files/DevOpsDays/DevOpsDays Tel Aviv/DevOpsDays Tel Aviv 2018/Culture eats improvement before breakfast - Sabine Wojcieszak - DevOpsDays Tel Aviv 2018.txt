Description: 
	Breakfast is the meal where you prepare yourself for the day â€“ for doing something great. In DevOps continuous improvement is an important goal for everyone involved. But what if the organizational culture is the way that improvement will be eaten before you can prepare for it?

	00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:10,920
hello everybody my name is Sabina vucic

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,900
I'm here from Germany and I'm happy to

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,350
be here for the second time my first

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,800
devops days Tel Aviv was in 2015 and

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,080
yeah it's wonderful to come back and be

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,660
on this awesome event and explore the

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,840
Magic City my topic today is culture its

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,480
improvement before breakfast I think I

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,820
need to explain a little bit about this

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,040
headline yeah for me breakfast is the

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,190
thing of the day which delivers the

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,460
first energy after we have slept we

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,940
stand up and we have breakfast some of

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,210
us do before believe our home some us of

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,940
us do this at work but no matter how

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,579
your breakfast looks like it's the first

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,989
place of the day where you can get

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,149
energy and already the famous Peter

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,720
Drucker said culture eats strategy for

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,820
breakfast he also included the term

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,390
culture and eating and some-something

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,610
and breakfast and this was reused by

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,770
mark fields former president and CEO of

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,090
port and he extended this idea he said

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,570
organizational culture eats strategy for

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,070
breakfast lunch and dinner so don't

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,979
leave it unattended

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,549
which means culture is really important

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:35,579
because if the culture does not work

00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:39,299
strategy is gone he says if we want to

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:44,420
do a corporate transformation we need

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:48,930
the powerful tree on Viraat of strategy

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:52,970
capabilities and culture and if we now

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:56,130
look at his quote culture eats strategy

00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:58,680
we really see that these three are not

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,710
aligned but they need to be aligned to

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,229
be the powerful triumvirate so if

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,580
culture is that bad that it eats

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:11,129
strategy for breakfast dinner and lunch

00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,959
the transformation will not happen in a

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,400
good way

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,069
so what is culture what does

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,819
organizational culture this is a good

00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,959
question

00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:25,359
usually culture is the implicit rules

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,790
that are the implicit rules of how we

00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:30,040
behave each other how we work together

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,549
how we deal with each other when

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,280
problems arise and in companies which

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:40,569
are good culture perhaps this culture

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,609
goes hand in hand with the philosophy

00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:44,709
with the mission of the company and all

00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:47,680
those stuff but we have a lot of

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:50,560
companies which have written down some

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,739
kind of vision some kind of mission or

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,680
some kind of philosophy how we what want

00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:59,139
to interact with each other this is on

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,180
one hand and on the other hand is how

00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:06,159
people live this so culture does not

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,250
automatically follow the written down

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,790
philosophy of a company culture is the

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:16,359
thing are we able to live the philosophy

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:19,060
we want to live or do we other stop

00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:22,090
subcultures in this case a very

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,370
practical approach how human and

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,579
companies interact with each other and

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:31,239
this can differ from the expected

00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:34,750
behavior so why we for breakfast

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:38,919
so don't be shocked this is me before

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,229
breakfast yeah so whenever we get out of

00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:44,379
bed when we stand up and when I do not

00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:46,449
have my breakfast I'm not prepared to

00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:49,810
fight anything yeah

00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:51,909
the only thing I want to is yeah get

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,009
dressed up get makeup and get my

00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:57,729
breakfast and then I'm ready for the day

00:03:54,009 --> 00:04:00,310
and I'm ready to fight whatever comes in

00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:07,870
the day I'm also ready to fight a bad

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:12,430
culture in DevOps you know this the CIA

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:15,189
CD right what does it mean yeah this is

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:19,150
your interpretation - yes the C is for

00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:23,800
the continuous but the AI is for

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:25,630
improvement and the D for the

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,710
development of individual

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:32,620
and team so CI CD can also mean

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,840
improving your individual skills and

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,240
improving your team collaboration all

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,960
those stuff in this in a continuous way

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,140
because improvement it's one of the

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,730
essentials of doing DevOps continuous

00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:51,190
improvement is one key factor of being

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,860
successful in DevOps this is why I

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,620
choose the topic of improvement for this

00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,190
DevOps talk although my examples will

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,870
not come from technical companies but

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,200
that does not matter because this

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,000
happens again and again so Who am I I'm

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,600
Sabina Bendix and I'm from the northern

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,210
part of Kiel of Germany with the city is

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,030
called keel and we are working as

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,700
consultants for companies who want to be

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,070
more aged I who want to improve team

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,640
kamala collaboration who want to do

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,770
DevOps and yeah these companies are not

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,290
all coming from the technical part

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:32,410
because of digitization we now have a

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,960
lot of companies who are not technical

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:39,610
companies but need all these approaches

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,310
for improving their work and yes it

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,950
might look if I'm a really polite person

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,660
but sometimes I can be the real pain and

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,600
pointing out the things which are not

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:53,380
working very well and this is important

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:57,900
because my whole life I was always

00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:05,080
wondering why people are enduring bad

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:06,850
behavior bad teamwork bad habits and why

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,100
they are not addressing those bad

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:14,020
behavior so where is the tolerance of

00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:17,980
enduring all those stuff when do they

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:21,850
say no this is not the way how people

00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:25,090
should deal with me I don't want this

00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:27,370
yeah and I think it's an important skill

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,560
for doing my job to point out all those

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:34,870
things and say no we can't do this

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:39,550
better so let's have a closer look 23

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:42,970
years ago I was hired by a company

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:45,819
with a very strong hierarchy we had the

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:48,729
senior manager who was also the founder

00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:55,240
of the company it was a command and

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:59,349
control system was very low trust a lack

00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:04,000
of transparency no appreciation shown in

00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:09,610
daily work blame game was very popular

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,009
there and no sharing because of job

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,560
security when I was the expert of a

00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,539
topic I should be the only expert of the

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,210
topic yeah it does not make sense to

00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:20,470
share my knowledge with someone else

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:24,699
because then someone else could maybe

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:27,610
get my job so everything we don't want

00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:31,690
to have in DevOps right this is not the

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:34,330
basic idea of DevOps but what every

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:37,120
employee was very good in was to cover

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:40,449
your ass to find out how to bring

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,310
yourself out of the way and yeah blame

00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:49,830
perhaps someone else for things going

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:52,870
wrong and our culture was driven by fear

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,569
whenever our senior manager called

00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,430
someone in for the meeting

00:07:54,569 --> 00:08:00,219
fear suddenly was there they started to

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:03,789
sweat somehow like the NIA gara falls

00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:06,759
under your arms and so on no one really

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:09,789
wanted to be called in by the senior

00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,690
manager and no one really wanted to go

00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:18,819
there and discuss stuff with him because

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:21,550
they were afraid of him why did we have

00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:24,250
a hire and fire mentality no we didn't I

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,440
was responsible for people development

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,029
there and from my point of view we

00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,870
should have hired some people much

00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:34,659
earlier then we'd actually did but

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:37,919
somehow the gossip Factory was very

00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:41,919
great and people were always telling

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,440
that this company has a bad culture and

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,079
bad things are happening to employees

00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:52,779
when they have to go to the senior

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:53,380
manager why I can tell you he has a very

00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,180
head

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,390
had a very bad habit he was always

00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,720
asking questions in order to point out

00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:07,000
your stupidity to make you look like a

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,770
fool and to point out your failure but

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,150
the worst thing about this is this

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:15,130
happens no matter who was around not

00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,650
only in a face-to-face conversation but

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,080
also within the group and he did it was

00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:24,520
no respect to the role of the people or

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,980
the whole situation and he also did it

00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,380
with his general managers we had several

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,720
branches out of our headquarter and

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,400
every branch has a general manager and

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,770
when we had a meeting with general

00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,750
managers and some manager said oh I've

00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,600
got a question that might be a problem

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:43,450
he did exactly the same thing with our

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:48,340
managers and they were all so afraid of

00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:52,330
him yeah I was in a position he called

00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:54,520
me in for meeting with our managers 25

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,130
people sitting there it was my second

00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:02,620
week in the company and she tried to do

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:05,800
this game with me and I listened to him

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,450
for a while and then I said okay I think

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,520
this is the thing we should discuss

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,670
afterwards in a face-to-face meeting

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,050
perhaps this might me might make much

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,260
more sense because it's not interesting

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:19,390
for everyone else here and he was just

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,560
smiling nodding his hands and yes let's

00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:27,010
go on so he was happy but there was

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,830
another problem whenever you came up to

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:34,570
him with an idea he said this is a bad

00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:37,720
idea we can't do this few weeks later he

00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:42,310
sold this idea to everyone else in the

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:45,880
company as his own idea for me it was

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,860
okay because I thought what we can take

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,770
out of it is the most important stuff

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,950
but after some times it was really hard

00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:58,500
because he never let people shine he

00:10:53,950 --> 00:11:01,690
never gives someone the one minute of

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,089
appreciation the one minute of saying

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,490
thank you or something like this he took

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,420
it as his own idea he sold it as his own

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,790
idea

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:15,460
and he never ever told anyone that this

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:18,040
idea came from another person so what

00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:22,420
was about our middle management the

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:25,810
middle management was afraid too but

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:28,060
they thought it is a good idea to copy

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,180
and paste nice behavior without

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,130
understanding what's behind it so we had

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,630
the senior manager the middle manager

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:39,550
and all the general managers and our

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:45,400
branches who are afraid of him but were

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:48,670
behaving exactly in the same way I asked

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:52,150
him what is your motivation in doing

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:55,450
such stuff all these people who have

00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:58,570
these responsible roles who are very

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:02,020
important for our company are afraid of

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:06,970
you why are you always showing them that

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:08,290
you are the big boss you need people who

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,600
take responsibility for the

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:14,590
responsibility for what they are doing

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,210
and he said to me I want to see when do

00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:20,620
they say stop it

00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:25,390
and for him to say stop was a very

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:27,850
important thing to trust them but nobody

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,250
nobody understood this game this was the

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:33,580
bad thing about it yeah so his intention

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:36,130
was to find out when do people say stop

00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,860
to find out if he can trust them or not

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:46,050
but people were so afraid that this game

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:49,750
does not work improvement in our company

00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:51,520
no one really wanted to go to him and

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,030
say we have a problem we need to improve

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,800
somehow no one wanted to sell an idea to

00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:01,450
him because he would take the idea and

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,240
sell it as his own so we had nearly no

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:07,750
improvement everyone was just there and

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:12,570
saying I'm working here from 9 to 5 and

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:16,180
that's enough but today the thing about

00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:19,270
the amount of people working just from 9

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,860
to 5 and the amount of people who

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,710
engaged for the companies

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,230
it's for most companies the GameChanger

00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,390
if they will stay competitive and if

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,760
they will be successful in life we have

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,740
to change the amount of people who

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,070
really engage for what they are doing

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,930
and reduce the amount of people who are

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,150
just doing their job so we need to

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,720
motivate them and people who are really

00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:46,480
motivated and engaged they will also

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:51,970
give in ideas how to improve stuff

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,610
I quit some day I can give another talk

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,980
about the reason why so the result was

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,870
at one day I said that's enough for me I

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:03,610
need to go I need to take the

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:05,920
consequence yeah and I was on the

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:11,410
conference in autumn this year also

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:15,690
another devops days in 2018 yeah 23

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:18,340
years ahead of my first experience and

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,650
we had an open space which was

00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,350
ultimately happening this afternoon and

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:26,470
we asking the question who is

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:32,920
responsible for changing culture

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:35,170
the answer was everybody but and at the

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,530
end of the discussion it turned out that

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:44,530
most of the people sitting there all

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:47,080
doing devops said I am afraid to speak

00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:50,320
up when something goes wrong in the

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:56,760
interpersonal intercultural behavior I

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:59,650
am afraid of losing my job 2018 DevOps

00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:08,680
where all these things are essential

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:11,350
parts of our collaboration so in 2008 23

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,520
years ago it was okay for me but now we

00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:18,130
should have had a mindset change where

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,410
we have rerun that fear is not a good

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,660
approach to improve and not a good

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:26,640
approach for collaboration and still it

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:29,320
is there even in the DevOps environment

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,150
so let's have a look at some bad habits

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,120
which are eating improvement before

00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,660
breakfast one is use power for bad yeah

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,129
that's

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:41,199
you make people look stupid might be

00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:43,750
funny for the one who's doing it but not

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,230
good for collaboration trust and all the

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:49,600
stuff if you are too provoking it can go

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,519
into the wrong direction sometimes being

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,370
a little bit provoked if it's okay but

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:58,689
if it's too much it can make the people

00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:00,850
shut their mouth fear is definitely not

00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:04,810
a good way how to run a company or a

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:09,220
team and the gossip Factory is not

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:11,680
helpful for improvement yeah and if

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:15,639
there is no chance to shine for people

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:20,189
in which way ever it's really hard to

00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:24,009
bring in some ideas what we can do so

00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:26,860
let's take a look at nowadays I'm also

00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:31,240
lecturing at the University and we have

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:34,389
a program for foreign master students

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:38,189
master information engineering from all

00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:43,449
over the world in your Pakistan China

00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:48,839
Iran Iraq all over the world and last

00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:51,579
year I got a lot of emails and questions

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,540
requests for appointments were students

00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:57,339
the foreign students told me about

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,649
mental health issues they complained

00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:01,750
about that they are not able to deal

00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:05,110
with what is going on at university and

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:07,299
they that they have real heart problems

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,669
and that they are suffering from that so

00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:12,610
it was not only one student or two it

00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:14,409
were a lot of students and all students

00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,510
which are not actually joining my

00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:19,150
classes anymore they already finished my

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:22,319
classes and at some point I said okay

00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:25,689
this is a problem we need to discuss and

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:30,630
I sent an email to the Dean and said

00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:33,159
dear Dean we might have a problem

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,409
we really should discuss it and I

00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:38,440
reported about this problem that a lot

00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:41,530
of students I also gave a number of the

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,039
students dressed me and told me about

00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:48,370
their health their mental health issues

00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:51,430
and that we should think about what we

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:54,380
in do to protect this because we have

00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:55,980
perhaps Cairo gaps and all those stuff

00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,440
[Music]

00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:03,640
it took some time three weeks later it

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,220
was a Saturday morning I got the answer

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,230
from the Dean ant which says dear mrs.

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,200
Felicia shocked that can't be because

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,930
you are the only one who is reporting

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,160
this even our professor for special

00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:20,470
Affairs hasn't heard about this so it

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,070
can't be because I am the only one who

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:26,230
is reporting it might be that this

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,450
problem is not that obvious because not

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,550
everyone is running around saying hey I

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,160
have mental health issues can you please

00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:36,040
help me who is doing that no one you

00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,190
need someone you can trust to express

00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,230
yourself so we had a proffer for the

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,929
professor for special Affairs and he

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,570
should usually be this person students

00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:50,950
go to but out of some reason they don't

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:52,780
have trust to him and the worst thing

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:59,350
was that 12 people

00:18:52,780 --> 00:19:02,530
I haven't spoken before where on PCC so

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:05,470
he sent around my email with his comment

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:09,660
that this could not be - a lot of people

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:12,309
I have never talked to before

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:16,780
can you imagine what was happening

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:20,350
inside of me usually people would say

00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,210
okay that's not my business I'm just a

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,520
lecturer not a professor at this

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:30,780
university so it's not my business

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:33,610
anymore I go but I was in fight mode

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,070
because I really like my students and

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:38,650
I'm really taking care of my students

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:41,470
and if people come to me and complain

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:45,460
about such things I start to fight for

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:47,860
them and the first thing was that I

00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:51,070
asked the Dean for a meeting where I

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,410
wanted to tell him you can write

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,590
whatever you want to me but please do

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:59,020
not put 12 people I have never taught

00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,090
two on BCC if we need to discuss

00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:06,820
something let's do this together

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:09,759
not with everyone else he tried to tell

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:14,350
me that he is the one who is deciding to

00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:17,259
lecture at the University and that I am

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,870
usually not fulfilling the requirements

00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:22,779
and all those stuff perhaps he thought I

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:26,649
might be afraid of losing my job there

00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:28,899
but this does not work with me so there

00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:32,950
was another meeting which was called in

00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:35,590
by the professor of special Affairs he

00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,679
wanted to tell me that this is his job

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:41,889
and I don't have to discuss such topics

00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:44,679
with my students and I said hmm why not

00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:46,119
when students come to me and discuss

00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:47,950
this with me and I'm open enough to

00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:51,129
discuss it with you

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:54,249
I share the problem why should I do not

00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:56,230
I not do this yeah you have to send him

00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:59,139
to me I said I always do this they won't

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:02,110
go so he wanted to point me to my limits

00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:05,649
in this job then there was another

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:10,809
meeting the Vice President and several

00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:14,889
other professors we discussed the

00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:19,919
question do we really meet goals when we

00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:19,919
want to change the actual way it is

00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:24,999
because at the beginning ask before we

00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:27,909
try to find out what we do next

00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:29,830
perhaps we should put our point out what

00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:33,669
is the goal of it what should be the

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:36,820
goal no we don't need to go that was not

00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:38,950
important then another professor try to

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,980
point out that is my fault because I'm

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:45,240
talking about all the soft skills stuff

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:50,019
in DevOps and that's the reason why

00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,940
students suddenly feel mental ill and

00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:55,029
come over to me because I'm talking

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:59,110
about this it's my problem and we had

00:21:55,029 --> 00:22:00,789
the always discussion one professor told

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,429
me the students are all bad

00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:05,830
because whenever he had an appointment

00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:09,399
with the students they always come late

00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:13,179
they always leave during the meeting

00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:14,410
without an explanation and I asked him

00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:17,440
hmm

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,970
because I have had I think about 70

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,720
meetings with students over the last

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:25,690
year no one came late and no one left

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,470
the meeting so please let me know how

00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:37,600
much is always what does always mean to

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:41,110
you yeah I think there was one guy who

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,020
left yeah and the other two who didn't

00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:46,240
show up sent me an email before so okay

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,400
no always but this always was in the

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,460
head of the people and he always was

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,490
what he said is some kind of gossip to

00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:57,730
all other professors we had a meeting of

00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:01,710
90 minutes 90 minutes with all these

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:04,720
high decorated expensive people result

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:10,150
another meeting with two vice presidents

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:13,330
and more professors no appreciation it

00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:16,060
was after working time was only a bottle

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:20,880
of water and some very dry cookies on

00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:24,100
the table but okay we had the question

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,870
what common goals versus individual

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,790
goals and we definitely had one

00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,950
professor who stood up after time said

00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:32,650
okay my individual goal is reached

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,390
I can leave he didn't stay until the end

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:38,530
because he had the impression his

00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:41,440
personal goal was reached he expressed

00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,360
it in that way and he left not

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,420
interested if we are able to reach the

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,600
common goal to improve the whole course

00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,530
yeah

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:55,200
no idea and this we had a lot of

00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:58,810
professors who are experts how to run

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,900
projects in a professional way all the

00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:04,990
expertise were on the table but the

00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:08,740
practical part was on another side of

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:11,800
the story and I said hey we all are

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:15,340
professionals in project management but

00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:20,590
what we are doing here is some kind of

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:22,600
first class first class in school yeah I

00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:26,230
think some children could do it better

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,000
and suddenly the vice president told me

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,950
stop it I

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:37,540
don't want to hear this anymore from you

00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:39,280
okay so my arguments were not

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,350
interesting anymore to the vice

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,720
president

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:45,730
they found episode a solution which was

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,600
that two students from the bachelors

00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:52,750
course should help 250 foreigner

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,080
students to learn more about how it

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:58,960
works in Germany to students from

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,780
bachelors course should help 250

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:06,040
students from other countries to improve

00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:09,550
their studies and get rid of their

00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:12,730
mental health issues good solution and

00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:17,140
yeah already it was the who should we

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:19,570
blame for this so the idea of the whole

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,090
meeting was not to find a good solution

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:24,880
to make it better it was a very

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:29,310
political arrangement of people sitting

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:33,340
together trying to cover the rest and

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:38,470
yeah get rid of more work this took

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:42,820
three hours again try to calculate how

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:45,070
much money this could be this was my

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,890
reaction after this and I said okay I am

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:50,080
doing my lectures I'm not interested was

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,300
the what a university is doing anymore

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,970
I'm just doing my lectures I will help

00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:59,080
the students as much as I can but I will

00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:01,660
not try to improve the situation so we

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,510
have already some aspects back had bad

00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:07,320
habits and we can put some more on it no

00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:10,990
clear common goals are very bad for

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:13,690
improvement interfering goats so which

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:18,550
means personal goals versus common goals

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:23,020
when they do not fit together are very

00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:25,570
very dangerous also the attempt if you

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:29,650
want to threat someone or don't show

00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:34,180
appreciation if open discussion is not

00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:37,140
wanted and if there is no interest also

00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:40,390
in the bad news this is really hard for

00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,560
improvement and does this only happen at

00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:47,680
University

00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:50,800
no last week I met a former CEO office

00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:55,120
of a midsize company and he told me for

00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:59,320
him in his times he had to spend a lot

00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:02,140
of time to get rid of the middle

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,080
management filter he spent a lot of time

00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,640
talking to the employees without the

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,790
filter of the middle management in

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,920
between so that he can really hear what

00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:17,950
problems are there where the work is

00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:20,440
done yeah and in that same afternoon I

00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:23,740
met an IT manager from another company

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,940
and he told me I could not report this

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:29,200
to our sea level and I said why not

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,300
because they will not understand the

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,450
problem and they will not understand the

00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:36,460
solution so I will not tell them and ask

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:40,120
what are you telling them if they ask I

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:43,690
would say everything is fine so the sea

00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:46,840
level needs to be able to hear bad news

00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,730
as well they need to one day they should

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,830
want to hear bad news but they also need

00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,080
to be able to hear the bad news and if

00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,390
the middle management is filtering out

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,920
all those stuff they are not able to

00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:01,750
hear the bad or the good news another

00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,230
point which comes up again and again

00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:07,210
when I discuss with teams about

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:10,570
improvement is that they say the lead

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:13,420
time of ideas when they talk the first

00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,470
time about the idea until something is

00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:18,370
done about it

00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:20,200
it's much too long it takes more than a

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:23,170
year or something like this if things

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,850
are improved and then no one remembers

00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:27,970
anymore and maybe this improvement is

00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:30,280
not right anymore at that time so this

00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:32,670
also leads to the point that they often

00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:36,160
have to have the impression that

00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:39,190
decisions are not made in time it takes

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:45,550
too much time until management makes a

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:48,550
decision a few days ago I found this

00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:51,880
quote by young oppelo on Twitter and I

00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:53,920
think you know young oppelo all I want

00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,309
for Christmas is fewer brilliant ideas

00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:02,740
and more brilliant

00:28:55,309 --> 00:29:09,610
execution so we have a lot of ideas and

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:09,610
in many cases that's it we have ideas

00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:17,919
sometimes we do some half-hearted

00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:21,019
attempts to bring these ideas to life

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,669
but half-hearted is not enough if we

00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:25,039
have ideas and if we are really

00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:26,990
convinced that these ideas are good to

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,289
improve our whole culture our whole

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:32,690
system we should have variant execution

00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:38,059
on these ideas and really spend some

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:40,129
efforts on executing so we can extend

00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:43,639
the list the middle management filter is

00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:46,549
also not good for improvement we can add

00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:48,919
the decision and decision-making time

00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:51,379
which are maybe bad habits for

00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:55,190
improvement also the lead time which is

00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:57,529
too long but when does it all start

00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:00,769
thank you very much to Siobhan for

00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:02,509
sharing this picture with me it starts

00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:04,399
at the very first beginning Sharon

00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:07,100
shared this picture that was her first

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,830
day in the new company very welcoming

00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:12,649
atmosphere her place was arranged for

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,299
everything and yeah I think if you

00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:16,879
joined this company and they will

00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:18,950
welcome you in this way you know that

00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:21,980
they really appreciate that you come to

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:26,450
them but it's this reality at most of

00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:29,799
the companies Oh Sabina can you take my

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:32,509
Cova he has his first day today can you

00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:35,629
show him around and introduce him to

00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:37,279
others while I was looking for ya for a

00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:39,169
laptop for him or something like this

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,149
which is the other side of the story but

00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:45,169
which is the reality in some companies

00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:48,499
so we are always discussing what can we

00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:51,100
do to motivate people but the better

00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:54,529
question is what can we do to not

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:58,100
demotivate them because with everyone

00:30:54,529 --> 00:31:00,440
who is joining our company you can be

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:04,639
sure that this person is really highly

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:09,290
motivated and this person offers you a

00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:13,490
very unique ability this person

00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:15,890
have still they look from outside it's

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:20,780
not caught up in the politics of the

00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:23,090
company so if you work um a person from

00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,540
the first day and say we are really

00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:28,760
happy to have you here please share your

00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:32,059
impression with us and please share with

00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:35,049
us what can we do to perform better to

00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:37,640
improve we are really happy about this

00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:39,559
but if you have your first day and you

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:43,640
have the impression that they forgot

00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:48,950
that you come it's a really negative

00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:51,620
start yeah I still want to change the

00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:54,500
world but as I don't have the source

00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:57,380
code I need to find another way and this

00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,809
way is that we all can start with

00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,700
ourself to change the world we don't

00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:05,000
need the source code for it we can start

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:07,970
with ourself and maybe we are like the

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,610
wing wave of a butterfly which is at the

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:15,110
end motivating other people to join us

00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:18,140
and if we want to start with ourself we

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:21,160
need to be brave we need to come out of

00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:24,799
our comfort zone and we need to take

00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:27,320
responsibility for our own behavior and

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:32,630
also for what we are willing to endure

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:35,840
or what not this also means that we

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:38,210
should really behave like grown-ups in

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,090
our professional life and actually I

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,970
really like the way how Google employees

00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:46,220
are fighting that behavior from their

00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:48,650
top management and say we don't like

00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,440
this this is not our philosophy they

00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:55,850
stand up for it and as it is not what we

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,730
want and I think from our own

00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:01,970
perspective of self-respect we really

00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:06,950
need to do this if things are not the

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:10,580
way we want them to be it's about us to

00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:13,910
say this and we need to protect things

00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:16,640
in our culture which are good but we

00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:19,460
also need to fight bad behavior in our

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,260
culture if it is if this is dangerous

00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:25,059
for our good culture

00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:28,120
so here are some good habits for

00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:32,950
improvement use power for good and we

00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:35,140
all have power it's not defined by your

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:37,750
role it's defined by your personality

00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:41,380
and everyone has power everyone has

00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:44,380
influence we can use it we can help

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:50,500
people to grow and we can give them

00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:52,450
their minute of shining we should

00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,450
welcome people and we should welcome

00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:58,210
ideas even if it turns out later that

00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:00,580
this idea it's not the idea we want to

00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:03,400
bring to life but first of all we should

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,530
welcome this idea because it's important

00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,429
to get ideas to collect ideas and then

00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:10,540
to find out what we really want to do we

00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:15,909
should fight the middle-management

00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:19,929
filter if you're a manager don't filter

00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:22,780
out what you give up to to the c-level

00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:26,590
just go on and let them know reality

00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:29,710
what is reality in our company reduce

00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:33,250
the lead time of bringing ideas into

00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:36,909
life and make decisions the decision is

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:40,240
also to say no yeah nothing is worse

00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:43,030
than no decision and sometimes it's good

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,629
to say no then you can cancel it from

00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:48,850
