	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,450
I usually give presentations that are

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,759
given before and the first time is

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,340
always a bit tricky so we're okay thank

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,550
you for your patience learn from your

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,070
mistakes okay so as people working in

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,980
tank how do we go about feeling

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,140
fulfilled how do we find meaning in our

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,220
lives so I've worked in a number of

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,590
different companies our work for credit

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,359
card companies I've worked with people

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,270
I've worked with banks of work with

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,500
people who sell train tickets and I when

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,450
you come into work I mean how many of

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,070
you actually care about credit cards I

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,390
work for Ticketmaster I don't actually

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,040
care very much about people buying

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,410
baseball tickets it's not very

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,940
interesting to me do you really care

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,620
about identifying that song that's

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,030
playing on the radio you probably don't

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,950
down a heart unless you know you're a

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,930
founder or something so how do you

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,670
manage to build healthy lives and stay

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,190
happy within an organization where you

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,670
don't necessarily feel aligned with what

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,469
the company is doing so it's not easy to

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,780
find the perfect job it's not easy to

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,430
find perfect colleagues it's not easy to

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,920
find the perfect language or environment

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,890
to work in because we can't change

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,470
external factors very easily well what

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,689
it is it's possible to change the way we

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,360
think and the way we experience the

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:21,840
world how do we think how do we act how

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,400
do we relate how do we find meaning and

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,990
we can do that by working on our minds

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,030
so if we transform our minds it has

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,310
fantastic benefits it benefits ourselves

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,079
the benefits are closed environment our

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,310
teams our friends our families our

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,930
benefits our organizations and

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,570
ultimately because of a ripple effect it

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,570
benefits the whole world so I'm going to

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,250
talk to you about the 16 human Dunn's

00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:47,119
so in the seventh century AD there was a

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,369
warrior king his name was sunsun gam po

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,200
he United the tribes of Tibet from where

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,659
Kabul is now all the way across to the

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,630
border of China he managed to reinforce

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,729
his his strategic alliances by marrying

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,439
he married princesses from Nepal and

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,240
Bhutan and they were both Buddhists and

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,270
consequently he became a Buddhist and

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,680
was the first Buddhist king of Tibet now

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,739
he had a bunch of legacies including

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,940
reading writing paper alphabets and one

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,010
of the things he did was he wrote this

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,629
thing called the sixteen

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,310
human diamonds and that could be

00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,769
translated as laws but not as an you

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,680
must do this but more kind of guidelines

00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:23,750
and these 16 Dharma's address for wisdom

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,110
themes and they form a foundation for

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:30,079
skillful life yeah it sounds a bit like

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,909
religious claptrap to me mmm well no

00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:33,739
actually not really this is actually

00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:35,269
deeply deeply grounded in current

00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,730
scientific findings around your

00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:40,609
plasticity emotional health servant

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,769
leadership emotional intelligence active

00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:44,989
listening or valuable and useful things

00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:46,909
and actually the Dalai Lama himself says

00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:48,500
hey try this stuff out if it works for

00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,900
you that's great and if it doesn't hey

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,139
no big deal so let me tell you a bit

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,519
about myself five years ago it was a

00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:58,190
great great honor for me to come and

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,040
speak at this conference in the Google

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,959
campus in tel-aviv and now I shared a

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,049
bit about my own personal experiences of

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,730
burnout and mistakes early the following

00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:09,200
year I started as a director of

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,730
infrastructure operations that are small

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,519
but growing comedy with some fascinating

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,470
stuff to do yet only a few months later

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,799
I'd repeated exactly the same patterns

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,989
that I'd shared with you that autumn by

00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,739
summer 2014 I'd rage quit the industry

00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:26,959
 this like I am done I I was angry I

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:27,949
was ill I was drinking too much I was in

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,910
a complete mess

00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:34,340
really really really badly burned out

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,590
why well I think it's because I didn't

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,419
really have a framework I didn't really

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,940
have got I had a few ideas like things

00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,989
maybe maybe this would help but I didn't

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,510
have something that was really

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,949
structural so what I'm gonna share with

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,419
you could come across is kind of preachy

00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:50,540
and holier than that but please please

00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:52,489
understand this is coming from a deeply

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,949
deeply deeply flawed human being a

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,590
person who struggles daily to stay happy

00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:59,690
a person who struggles daily to live a

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,190
values-based life and the guidelines I'm

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,599
going to share with you are ones which

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,069
have worked for me over the past two or

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,569
three years and I did take that more

00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,859
than two years out before I felt well

00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:09,169
well enough to come back into the

00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,090
industry and it worked for me

00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:13,940
so in the spirit of love and sharing

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:17,329
please have a listen so we have four

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,099
wisdom themes and 16 guidelines so the

00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,769
for wisdom themes they basically how do

00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:24,050
we think how do we act how do we relate

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,180
and how do we find meaning so let's

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,310
start about thinking about thinking

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,680
so basically everything that we do and

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,440
everything that we say arises

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,710
principally from our thoughts our mind

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,800
is very very powerful where we live who

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:43,009
we choose as our friends what job we do

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,930
how we spend our time every single day

00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:46,370
our lives are shaped by thoughts from

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,110
the moment we are born until the moment

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,570
that we die and it's really really

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,250
natural for us to experience the world

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,750
something which is out there something

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,120
different something that happens to us

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,710
but actually when you focus on those

00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,630
external circumstances it can make us

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,180
really vulnerable because those

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,380
circumstances change

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,010
they add when they flow and they can

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,539
never be completely in our favor so

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,000
external circumstances like your MacBook

00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:14,780
you can't control them they airband they

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,550
flow but if you probe deeply it becomes

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,050
really really clear that how we

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,370
experience the world is actually

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,139
affected by what's going on inside

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,639
what's what's your state of mind right

00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:27,560
now so if we pause to consider we can

00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,389
realize behind every single emotion that

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,860
we have there's a thought and often

00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:32,270
we're not conscious of it often it

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,820
happens really quickly are that person

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,110
frightened me I'm gonna get hurt I can't

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,139
get what I want I'm sad

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,940
what a mess I'm not good enough all of

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,909
these things nobody likes me

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,440
when will my job end even if these

00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:47,570
thoughts are exaggerated even if they're

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,430
not true our minds have the power to

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,400
create a massive downward spiral of

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,599
misery and dissatisfaction but on the

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,340
other side of that there's a massive

00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:58,010
opportunity because just as an athlete

00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,560
trains their body we can train and

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,810
transform our minds and doing so we can

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,120
shift our habitual patterns and explore

00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:08,750
new ways of living so that stuff about

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,070
thinking what about acting so every

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,260
skillful action makes the world a better

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,729
place our human lives are composed of

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,580
billions and billions of actions which

00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:17,659
take place every minute of every day

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,039
Dalai Lama says if you think you're too

00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:22,310
small to make a difference try getting

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,919
into bed with a mosquito so how you

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,630
choose to act defines and colors the

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,960
very quality of your life and your

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,849
experiences so when we're going to do

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,620
something big like move to the USA

00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,630
choose a new job enter a relationship

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,010
most of us will reflect really quite

00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,289
carefully on whether it's going to bring

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,070
us the happiness that we want even if we

00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:41,480
choose something like

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,070
to go on holiday or even hey what

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,540
conference were going to go to we're

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,070
probably going to plan a little bit and

00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,520
decide this is gonna return what we

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,320
actually want but actually we perform

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,240
countless small actions every day and we

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,500
don't think about it at all maybe we

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,440
should maybe we should give attention to

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,690
the smallest things or small actions are

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,010
actually driven by habit so why do we go

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,390
to a certain shop why do we drink a

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,420
certain coffee why do we use a certain

00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,520
editor from the beginning of time our

00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,500
actions are built up by patterns and

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,830
patterns of emotion patterns of thoughts

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,480
patterns of of activity so just as an

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,790
apple seed will grow into an apple tree

00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,200
we need to review are the habits and

00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,470
patterns bringing us the results that we

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,270
need so what about relationships and

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,300
relating every time we cherish others

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,620
for cherishing ourselves and Martin

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,020
Luther King says we must learn to live

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,780
together as brothers or will perish as

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,430
fool's there's a simple fact that like

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,100
it or not we can't get by on our own

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,260
just look at this conference it's easy

00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,850
for to get the people who were working

00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,560
behind the scenes so that's big thank

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:46,790
you to the organizers fantastic table

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,230
but it's not just the organizers it's

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,150
the people who work in this building

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,620
it's the cleaners it's the people who

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,210
work in the power stations that allow us

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,830
to have electricity it's there is the

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,110
people who work in the data centers who

00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,910
allow us to have Network and all the

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,450
things bonnets the guy who drove me to

00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,520
the taxi the guy who drives the bus and

00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,200
you for coming absolutely and me and the

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,820
airplane everything there are endless

00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,170
connections and logical conclusion we

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,670
reach is that we link to every other

00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,490
being on the planet past present and

00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,440
future and we tend to overlook and

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,790
ignore these infinite connections but

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,280
that's actually unrealistic and actually

00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,900
it's an obstacle to our happiness

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,700
because we're deeply trained to see

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,070
ourselves as separate people we've

00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,630
worked hard we're independent it's great

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,690
to be self-centered look after number

00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,970
one I'm important I deserve it

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,410
prioritize my needs and concerns we're

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,910
encouraged to compete rather than

00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,610
collaborate just like we were saying

00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,770
before zero-sum game what do I want what

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,930
do you lose the result is often

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:45,230
isolation and loneliness and anxiety and

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,640
depression doesn't take a lot of effort

00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,750
to understand that the happiest people

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,820
are those who understand their

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,230
interdependence on other people they

00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,030
nurture warm and appreciative

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,770
relationships the people around them

00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,800
on a day-to-day basis this is probably

00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,690
the most immediate cause of happiness to

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,480
be kind to other people is to be kind to

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,370
ourselves and that the root of this is

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,530
having a sincere wish for other people

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,630
to be happy if we can cultivate this it

00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,010
sets off a chain reaction people are

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,700
then kind to other people who are kind

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,140
to other people

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,240
and even when we get things wrong and

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,580
behave on skillfully if we didn't intend

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,080
to hurt that makes a huge difference in

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,090
what ensue the situation

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,460
so the fourth wisdom theme is meaning

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,160
this is philosophical if everything and

00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,650
anything is changing everything and

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,900
anything is possible because change is

00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,970
all around us just look at nature the

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,640
world revolves day becomes night night

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,070
becomes day seasons come and go food

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,240
grows food decays machines were invented

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,250
and then they become obsolete

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,560
programming languages are invented they

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,240
become obsolete the clothes which one's

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,330
fashionable become faded they wear out

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,340
even crossed millennia mountains and

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,790
continents move they shift and they

00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,400
change

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,230
I lost living beings were also caught up

00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,820
in constant change the atoms in our

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,700
bodies and are they're in constant flux

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,290
I read that there's no there's no atom

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,280
in my body which is the same I can't

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,710
even remember how long it was a really

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,770
really recent like three years or

00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:09,140
something my entire body has changed

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:11,630
we're born we grow we reach adulthood we

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,830
die and in every single moment our

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,050
thoughts and emotions are shifting

00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,460
faster than we can imagine this moment

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,820
there will be no moment like this one

00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:22,070
ever again or this one or this one it's

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,580
constant constant change and change can

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,220
be scary

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,080
we've gotta choose either we welcome and

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,300
embrace change or we hide from it and we

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,470
deny it because change can be scary what

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,870
will the future hold is it going to be

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,339
better is it going to be worse but for a

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,220
moment just try to imagine life without

00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:38,870
change no opportunity no hope just stuck

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,050
where we are forever with no opportunity

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,490
to grow or develop if we can make wise

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,620
decisions about how to spend our time

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,390
and energy change is something we can

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,250
welcome and embrace because there's

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,670
infinite potential in every moment and

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,839
we have to choose how we grasp it or not

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,790
so while search for meaning is going to

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,070
depend on whether we're able to explore

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,350
new and unfamiliar territory that's why

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,940
we sometimes call it a path there's a

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,450
challenge to venture deep inside

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,830
ourselves who are we what are we doing

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,590
how can we make the

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,630
most of the time we spend on this year

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:14,810
so that's 16 guidelines stem from these

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:17,860
four themes so to transform our thinking

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:20,900
we need to cultivate humility patience

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,280
contentment and delight in terms of

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,970
actions we need to look for kindness

00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,860
honesty generosity and right speech in

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,410
our relationships we want respect

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,820
gratitude forgiveness and loyalty and as

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,770
we seek to find meaning we want to

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,600
abandon a narrow self-centered view of

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,550
ourselves in the world and develop

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,900
aspirations and principles service and

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,940
courage so that we can create a happy

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,460
life for ourselves and for other people

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,050
and I would encourage you to think about

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,880
each of these guidelines as I touch on

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,830
them like maybe think about holding one

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,270
in mind for the day or maybe in your

00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,740
teams and your stand-ups like pick one

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,780
like hey this today we're going to think

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,860
about generosity reflect on what it

00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,120
means to you personally and what a

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,780
difference it would make for you and

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,460
your people so humility

00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:04,130
so humility is being able to learn from

00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,080
other people so if you ever met anybody

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,360
who's convinced they are always right

00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,800
they never listen they think they can

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,200
never listen to anybody else then never

00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,920
learn imagine a world in which everybody

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,850
is like that I'll be terrible right

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,550
maybe that's what the world is like I

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,580
don't know humility is the antidote to

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:25,070
this dystopia so the mind is a bit like

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,080
a clay pot so sometimes it's overflowing

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,300
with thoughts there's no space to take

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,890
in anymore other times it's got a crack

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,050
in it and it's leaky so it can't kind of

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,540
hold on to its contents but a person who

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:38,150
has no humility there like a person with

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,590
a pot which is upside down it can't

00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,070
contain anything at all it can never

00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,110
change

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,660
and our challenge is to cultivate a

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:47,420
broad and spacious pot with room to hold

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,550
that ever is needed and the Danish

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,970
polymath patreon says the noble art of

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:57,200
losing face may one day save the human

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:58,940
race so what about patience so patience

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,970
is cultivating a calm and a spacious

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,400
mind so I want to think about the last

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,970
time you lost your cool at work just

00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,020
think about it

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,880
see if you remember it I'm sure it

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:11,450
didn't happen to many of you but did it

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,710
help or did it do damage and the thing

00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,150
is with impatience there's a lot of

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,500
impatience in Israel I notice there's a

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,150
lot of car beeping a lot of people

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,750
saying come on come on let's go come on

00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,970
move it

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,480
the thing with impatience anger

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,910
frustrate

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,250
irritations are become habitual and at a

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,900
neural level they're cutting grooves in

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,200
our minds the neural pathways are

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,730
strengthened every time we be power on

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,010
but making these decisions is a choice

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,920
if we can learn to spot the signs we can

00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:38,690
make a different one Emerson says for

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,140
every minute you are angry you lose 60

00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,980
seconds of happiness

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,170
what about contentment

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,830
so contentment is being satisfied with

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:52,730
who we are and what we have obligatory

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:54,410
funny meme so just steal your mind for a

00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,940
moment just just be peaceful I want you

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,420
to try and think of something that you

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,550
really strongly powerfully want it might

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,170
be a thing it might be a role the

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,170
responsibility or a relationship just

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,780
think about it hold it in your mind I

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:12,050
want you to think why you want it what

00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:14,120
is it that's so special about it I want

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,730
you to now imagine that you've achieved

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,830
that thing and some weeks have gone by

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,440
so you've got the thing it's now like a

00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,740
few months later can you imagine that

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,580
thing living up to your expectations or

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,570
actually do you think you're probably

00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,450
going to be yearning for yet another

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:32,200
change really interesting thing to think

00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:34,550
about Socrates says that he is rich

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:38,990
hears content with the least because

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:41,870
contentment is the wealth of nature so

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:45,440
delight delight is rejoicing in the good

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:48,350
fortune of others so now I want you to

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,030
bring to mind three people hold them in

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,950
your mind somebody that you're neutral

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,930
to so like that person over there that

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,910
you've never spoken to before somebody

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,230
that you're very fond of and somebody

00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,300
that you really really struggle with I

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,720
want you to imagine them almost like you

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,400
can feel them right next to you now I

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,550
want you to imagine a situation in which

00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:10,370
you can sense their joy their successes

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,200
you can see their talents see them being

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,170
skillful and succeeding at something and

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,500
for each person the enemy the neutral

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,270
person and the friend how do you feel

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:24,020
about them do you feel differently about

00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:26,360
each one is it actually helpful to feel

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,220
differently about each one are those

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,500
three categories actually so deeply

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,430
fixed your friend was once a stranger

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,649
maybe your enemy was once

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,690
friend and maybe that enemy will become

00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:42,850
a friend again does it really make sense

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,850
to which one person well and not another

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,350
Robert Louis Stevenson says to be rich

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,880
in admiration and free from envy to

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,160
rejoice greatly in the good of others

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,529
these are the gifts which money cannot

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,350
buy

00:15:53,529 --> 00:16:01,550
so kindness kindness is being friendly

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:05,660
and caring and considerate so I want you

00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:07,339
to reflect on 2018 I would suggest that

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,290
probably some of the best memories that

00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:12,260
you have of this year are ones where

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,850
kindness was given or received but I

00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,649
want you to ask yourself and be really

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,490
really honest

00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:21,020
have you been kind to yourself this year

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,540
have you pushed yourself too hard have

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,910
you pushed yourself to exhaustion have

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,260
you beaten yourself up what is the

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,029
little voice saying your head does it

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,410
say you're not good enough does it say

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,420
they're gonna work out soon enough I

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,800
don't know what I'm doing imagine the

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,940
words you say to yourself and saying

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,680
them to your best friend would you say

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:41,089
them or do you think god no I'd never

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:43,580
say that well try to make some time to

00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:45,380
extend love to yourself even if it's

00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,940
just making yourself a cup of tea or

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,680
taking yourself somewhere peaceful and

00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:55,459
beautiful every day try to think of this

00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:57,650
be kind to the you of tomorrow so that

00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:01,370
the you of tomorrow is blessed by the

00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:03,140
you of yesterday the Buddha says you

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,819
yourself as much as anybody in the

00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,360
entire universe deserve your love and

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:11,059
affection okay honesty this is a tricky

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:14,480
one honesty is acting with transparency

00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:16,130
and fairness a thing is we're not always

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,600
honest are we alike we know that it's

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,819
good to be honest but sometimes we're

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,730
not what I want you to do I want you to

00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:24,020
think of a time recently that you

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:28,010
weren't honest it doesn't have to be

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,990
like a massive lie like like oh I know I

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:33,260
I'm not having an affair but actually I

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,570
am just just a small thing and when you

00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,650
realize that you've not been honest use

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,150
the five R's

00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:42,950
so firstly reflect just regretfully and

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,360
sincerely reflect I kind of wish I

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,920
hadn't been dishonest it would have been

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,410
better if I wasn't

00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:52,070
secondly take refuge understand that

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:54,590
you're not always being dishonest you do

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:57,680
have the capacity to change then thirdly

00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:00,080
think about a remedy if it's appropriate

00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,720
maybe you could change you could make a

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,610
private or a public change and then

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,380
fourthly resolve resolved not to do that

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,000
again or at least maybe not for a

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,010
certain amount of time if it's really

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,050
tricky and finally rejoice rejoice that

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,520
you are willing to try to work on

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,010
bringing more honesty into your life I

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,010
struggle with this so so so much but

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,450
this is a good process Thomas Carlyle

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,340
says make yourself an honest man and

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,090
then you may be sure that there is one

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:28,370
less rascal in the world so generosity

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:32,150
generosity is to give without expecting

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:33,680
anything in return so I want you to

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:38,540
bring to mind somebody that you consider

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:40,130
to be generous is it you do you consider

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,040
yourself to be generous if not why not

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,180
is it because you don't have the time is

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,860
it because you feel that you don't have

00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,090
the talent maybe you don't have enough

00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,610
affection maybe you don't have enough

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,380
money this generosity is actually a very

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,580
natural expression for caring humans and

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,160
we're all carrying humans and it does

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,740
create happiness and it's very rare to

00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,300
give but it's even rarer to give without

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,130
expecting something in return

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,270
so I want you to think about when you

00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,580
might have the chance to give

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,860
spontaneously of your time just the gift

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,180
of your time think about whether you've

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,620
ever received that from somebody is

00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,050
somebody giving you their time and you

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,360
didn't expect it how did it feel do you

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:17,030
remember it a mentorship is a great way

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,230
of doing this finding an opportunity to

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,640
come alongside something less

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,830
experienced than yourself and give

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,880
freely of your time do some peer review

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:28,220
spend some time with them give I have no

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,780
intention of receiving Winston Churchill

00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:33,140
says you make a living by what you get

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,400
and you make a life by what you give so

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,530
white speech has a very Buddhist

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,890
expression isn't it right speech is to

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,850
speak with insight and sensitivity so

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,520
now what I want you to do is I want you

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,130
to think about somebody in your team I

00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,450
want you to try to imagine or if you

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,300
know even better what is happening in

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,460
their life what are their hopes what are

00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,040
their anxieties what are their

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:58,110
expectations I try to generate a feeling

00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,120
of goodwill towards those people

00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,610
now I want to you imagine that you have

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,679
the opportunity to give them some time

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:06,179
what do you need to do in yourself in

00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,980
order to guarantee that you'll be fully

00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,880
present imagine you've carved out at

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,529
that time what would you do would you

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,570
turn your phone off would you answer

00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:13,890
some important emails would you go and

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,390
solve an argument would you have for

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,500
somebody else what would you do so that

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,600
you would be fully present for that

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,140
person and that you concentrate more on

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,940
listening than talking

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:26,700
ramiz if this is so so so good somebody

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,340
told me this many years ago before you

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,320
speak let your words pass through three

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,139
gates and at the first gate ask yourself

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,630
is it true at the second gate ask

00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:38,549
yourself if it's necessary and let the

00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,990
third gate ask yourself if it's kind and

00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:44,340
if it isn't shut your mouth so respect

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,720
so respect is honoring people with a

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,440
deeper understanding and deeper

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,480
experience so there's a story there was

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,730
an elephant and a monkey and a rabbit

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,970
and a pheasant and they were forests and

00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,260
they're arguing about who owns a tween

00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:01,440
now the elephant says well I saw the

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,240
tree first so it's my tree the monkey

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,370
says okay but look at the tree do you

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,720
see any fruit on the tree the elephant

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,519
says no I don't see any fruit on the

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,100
tree the monkey says that's because I

00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,179
ate the fruit before you saw the tree

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,610
the elephant says okay fair enough

00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:16,080
maybe it's your tree then the rabbit

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,730
comes almost says was he's funny thing

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,470
you say that but I remember eating the

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,440
leaves of the tree when it was only this

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,870
tall I didn't have any fruit so it's my

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,039
tree pheasant comes on and says well

00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,539
it's interesting you should say that but

00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,940
I distinctly remember spitting out the

00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:32,370
seed that landed in the ground which led

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,470
between grow so the four animals get

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,419
together and they agree that is probably

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,519
the birds tree and they become friends

00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,380
and they work together and the fruits on

00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:41,789
the ground on the lowest branches the

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,039
pheasant in the rabbit they make a team

00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:45,630
sometimes the monkey climbs up and grab

00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,010
some trees from Hut from higher up and

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,080
only the elephant can reach the highest

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:51,029
branches and they collaborate together

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,620
they combine their strengths and their

00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:54,750
talents and nobody went hungry and the

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,010
other animals and the forest they noted

00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,990
the peace and the harmony and the

00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,340
cooperation the friendship and the

00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,220
interdependence and they call them the

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,080
four harmonious brothers and sometimes

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,029
they would see the elephant and the

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,559
monkey standing on the elephant and the

00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:09,059
rabbit standing on the monkey and the

00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,850
pheasant reaching right the way up

00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,990
standing on top of the rabbit

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,420
perhaps that how we should think about

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,850
collaboration in our teams I love this

00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,590
listen to your elders advice not because

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,560
they're right because they have more

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:23,900
experience of being wrong okay

00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,520
forgiveness so forgiveness is letting go

00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,520
of resentment and anger towards others

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,970
in ourselves so this time I want you to

00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:36,170
recall an incident that you regret how

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:37,880
did it arise who was involved if you had

00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,490
the chance to go back to that incident

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:44,030
what would you do now have you learned

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,830
from that incident that you regret if

00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:48,050
you're anything like me when you it

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,930
feels like March yeah I remember nice

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:52,640
feeling offer forgiveness to yourself

00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,860
learn to let go and move on because

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,810
carrying regrets and grudges and anger

00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,030
around it's like having a bag full of

00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:01,280
heavy rocks the only thing is ever going

00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:03,140
to do is hold you down and help hold you

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,850
back how can we lighten the load while

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,250
we could take one rock out and put it

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,530
down on the path either a tiny one will

00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,600
make a difference if we could read the

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,490
secret history of our enemies we should

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,830
find in each man's life sorrow and

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,890
suffering enough to disarm all hostility

00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:21,170
says Henry what's with long for them

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:22,970
okay so gratitude gratitude is

00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,520
acknowledging and repaying the kindness

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,470
of others so there's a Chinese proverb

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,180
which says when eating bamboo sprouts

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,340
remember the person who planted them I

00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,380
think this is really important in the

00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,660
work that we do in our daily work try to

00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:38,270
remember the people who make the tools

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,800
possible whether it's the kernel whether

00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,450
it's the editor whether it's the

00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,300
programming language the framework or

00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:46,250
the orchestration how could we show our

00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,710
appreciation for the people who make

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,060
open source software possible could we

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,790
set aside time to improve the

00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,730
documentation could we report a bug

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:58,040
could we join the community slack could

00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,550
we fix a bug could we even make a small

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,380
donation

00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,590
these are really important things that

00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,820
we can do to show our gratitude

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,140
Nietzsche says the essence of all great

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,450
art and of all beautiful art is

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,160
gratitude

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,810
okay loyalty loyalty is being

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,470
good-hearted and dependable in all

00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:17,000
relationships so loyalty is being there

00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,040
for other people when things fall apart

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,740
so I want you to think of a time and

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,510
somebody was there for you when you were

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,650
having a tough time what was the

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,690
situation what was happened

00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,180
in your life and when that person was

00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,410
there for you how did it feel we

00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,380
surprised that there was somebody there

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,700
for you did you feel touched now I want

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,620
you to think of somebody that you know

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,230
or even just suspect is having a tough

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,580
time off time with we're just not very

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,780
good at being there for people and more

00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,400
often than not it's because we think

00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,890
they don't need it or we think it would

00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,150
be an imposition or we're just shy but I

00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,580
want you to think about this and I want

00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,440
you to say what could you offer how

00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,790
could you help those people have their

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,980
needs met is there anything you could do

00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,810
could you listen is there a small sprack

00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,350
Tikal step you could take how could you

00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,970
be a maximum help to that person Samuel

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:06,130
Goldwyn says if I take fifty percent

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,130
efficiency to get 100 percent loyalty

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,700
okay so finally on to how we find

00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,110
meaning aspiration so aspiration is

00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:16,010
seeking fulfilling way of life that

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:18,500
avoids doing harm so we have a profound

00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:20,300
and heartfelt longing for purpose and

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,480
fulfillment we want to use our life and

00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:26,360
our skills and our gifts but the trouble

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,700
is we're distracted we're always busy

00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,460
one of my favorite authors Henry David

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:36,500
Thoreau he says it's not enough to be

00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:38,750
busy what are we busy about are your

00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,550
preoccupations and priorities aligned

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,410
with your aspirations because

00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,990
aspirations are like plants growing in a

00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,730
garden all those sees growing well are

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,200
they parched or are they being well

00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:52,340
watered are they tended or are they

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,840
choked by weeds even the most overgrown

00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,400
garden can become refreshing and

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,500
inspiring but it does need regular

00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,040
attention so I would suggest that you

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:05,200
try even if it's a minute a day or five

00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:08,030
minutes a week or an hour every so often

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,580
reflect on your aspirations and whether

00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,320
you're watering that garden Thoreau says

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,270
if you have built castles in the air

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,280
your work and need not be lost that's

00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:19,670
where they should be

00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,260
now put the foundations under them so

00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,930
principles principles this develops

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,720
stable inner values and avoid harmful

00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:29,780
influences so our principles are like

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,730
the ropes to hold 10 steady but our

00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,080
principles they evolve and change in

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,820
response to the people we meet and

00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,280
sometimes the people we meet they

00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,540
encourage us to help us lead our lives

00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,020
which are value centered

00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:43,460
sometimes not so much so take a moment

00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,530
now and see if you can bring to mind

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,500
somebody who is guided and influenced

00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:51,020
you somebody who's been a great

00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,060
impression who was it what did you learn

00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:57,740
from it what impact that they have on

00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:59,570
you think about that for a second and I

00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,580
think are there any friendships or

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,960
alignments that you regret that maybe

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,210
aren't in line with where you want to be

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,770
right now any that you wish you hadn't

00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,660
done what mistakes are a great chance to

00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:10,150
learn and grow what might you do

00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,350
differently next time

00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:14,060
JK Rowling says it takes a great deal of

00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,350
bravery to stand up to your enemies but

00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:20,060
just as much to stand up to your friends

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:22,060
so service services to help and benefit

00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,560
others in whatever way we possibly can

00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,790
if we build our life around the pursuit

00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,840
of personal pleasure

00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:32,480
will we be happy probably not helping

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,490
other people brings huge help but it can

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,020
be daunting and one of the best people

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,180
are giving Mother Teresa her advice on

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,160
this is begin your service one person at

00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,230
a time and start with the person who is

00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,460
closest so think of somebody very close

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,290
to you so there's something you could do

00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,770
to ease their burden because little bits

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:50,750
of good together rev well in the world

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,430
the best way to find yourself is to lose

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,490
yourself in the service of others sis

00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:58,340
candy and last and most difficult ly

00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:02,150
courage courage is to accept challenges

00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:04,460
with determination and equanimity we see

00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:06,830
courage everywhere the disabled athlete

00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,060
the single parent a child in the

00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,610
schoolyard standing up for themselves

00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,560
against a bully but actually courage is

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:15,080
the daily process of facing fear and

00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,470
difficulty so Pema Chodron describes it

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,640
as the vanguard of courage fear so just

00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,340
think for a second of something you're

00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,840
frightened of not something I massively

00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,240
frightened but something is just a bit

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,800
daunting focus on it for just a little

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,180
bit how does it feel

00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,650
the only way that we become fearless is

00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,170
to become acquainted with fear we can

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,570
never get rid of it or cast it out the

00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,950
only thing we can do is lean into it

00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:43,610
moving closer to it is a victory of

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:45,680
courage so turn towards your fear smile

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,500
at it work out what's the next step to

00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,730
move towards it in a spirit of bravery

00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,800
Viktor Frankl says when we are no longer

00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,280
able to change a situation where Chinese

00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,820
to change

00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:59,140
just sounds I really can't contain that

00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,160
any of this is new or original or mine

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,690
the wisdom themes that I presented

00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,940
they've been understood and tested and

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,440
taught for thousands of years and it's

00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,240
only in recent times with the emergence

00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,800
of positive psychology and advances in

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,230
neuroscience that were able to

00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,820
understand how powerful they are so I

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,490
started on this path during my long

00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,140
sabbatical I've read I've studied a

00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:20,560
great deal of experimented with various

00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:23,450
ways of working and transforming my mind

00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,240
I've been lucky enough to come across a

00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,320
really great number of resources

00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,850
particularly the foundation for

00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,380
compassion and wisdom based in London's

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,880
Elephant and Castle and it's those

00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,620
who've developed these 16 guidelines

00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,940
into an easily digestible form and I

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,190
have to acknowledge a huge debt of

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,840
gratitude to their work I also want to

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,670
give a shout out to Jeff Hackett and

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,150
Dave zwieback both of whom have been

00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:45,860
hugely influential in in my journey I

00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:47,930
just want to share some resources I will

00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,210
put these on a gist somewhere so the

00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,950
compassion and wisdom this is a great

00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,870
resource for you to go and look at the

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,850
reboot podcast the reboot broadcast is

00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,640
amazing it's a leadership and

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:01,700
entrepreneurial podcast very moving very

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,230
touching full of great wisdom -

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,330
fantastic books from a School of

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,100
Psychology called acceptance and

00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:09,290
commitment training so the happiness

00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,150
trap and the confidence gap very

00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:14,600
accessible books very very good

00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:18,590
similarly a radical acceptance by Tara

00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:20,000
branch very very powerful the book that

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,470
really got me started on this and

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,260
started me thinking and changed the way

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,880
I view the world is happiness a guide to

00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:29,360
developing life's most important skill

00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,310
by Mattioli car a very fine book Pema

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,510
Chodron is also fantastic her book when

00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:35,000
things fall apart

00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,890
and finally for practical activities

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,210
that you can take in your own life and

00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:40,160
your inter relationships with people in

00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,200
teams so I really recommends the Center

00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,060
for non-violent communication so this is

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,000
building on the work of marshall

00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,050
rosenberg's nonviolent communication so

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,350
I don't have anything else to say other

00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:56,300
than thank you

00:30:49,350 --> 00:31:01,430
[Applause]

00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:01,430
