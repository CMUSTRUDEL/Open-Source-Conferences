Description: 
	Our internally created tools boost our productivity, remove friction, and make our work-lives not suck. I will discuss a few tools I came across and a few I made to make our life not suck at work.

anybody here born in the 80s exactly

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,830
yeah so so is I so when the 90s came

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,080
around and this showing on the air it

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,600
was like whoa this mind blown I love

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,130
this show and the show of the Parker

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,070
Lewis can't lose instead of the guy in

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,740
the middle and he's supposedly the hero

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,529
right but I got the story for you

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,130
I think this guy is the real hero

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,260
because Jerry Steiner always had the

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,600
right device the right plot device to

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,070
move things forward he always had some

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,559
kind of weird documentation just found

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,450
to monitoring or whatever seriously go

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,860
back and watch parts of the show it's

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,640
amazing I think it survived the test of

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,510
timing that just me so I'd like today to

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,260
talk about the unsung glory of tools

00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,030
that people like Jerry made so Who am I

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,940
I am girl I currently work for our apps

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,080
flyer I recently joined them and in the

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,560
past I worked for a whole bunch of other

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,840
places and first let's discuss what is

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,189
an internal tool it's built to solve an

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,630
eternal pain it's developed internally

00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:17,460
it takes something that usually can be

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,250
done manually but just makes it easier

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,310
and it's usually coupled to a specific

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,729
infrastructure service it should be

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,229
clear these are not internal tools you

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,840
might be hosting some of them internally

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,770
but these are non internal tools these

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,600
are internal tools so for example

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,610
there's Santo if you have that flyer

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,159
which just sends docker containers to

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,950
all the nice boys and girls servers in

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,899
the cloud there's a cross flow which is

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,810
the attachment solution which I saw the

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,210
Oracle crosswise there's a clock just

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,250
clarify almighty rapper that Dan's not

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,640
here and then he's not here nevermind

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,680
which is really cool but wait those are

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,540
the tools that we do hear about because

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,240
they get a lot of glory they're like

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,969
these complex big machines that do a lot

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,979
of cool stuff I'm here to talk about the

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,640
unsung glory the tools that you don't

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,220
really usually talk about not the tools

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,510
that Gotham deserves

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,700
but definitely the tools good awesome

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,660
meats and maybe you know Commissioner

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,070
Gordon were to say that what her

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:24,410
whatever and because I like to talk to

00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,820
guy like to give these tools glory I'd

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,010
like to give them logos as well

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,440
these are superheroes in my realm anyway

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,110
and because I'm a lazy ass I just got

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,940
pictures off Google photos

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,520
Google Image Search so without further

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:42,320
ado our first superhero

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:46,190
this is VPN woman she is she has an

00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,209
amazing seven lines of code like the top

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,920
it's either the top part or at the

00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,709
bottom part they both basically gave you

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,140
the same things you might want and she

00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:56,570
allows you to connect to easily connect

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,420
to your VPN service at your evil Corp

00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:01,370
you can guess what that one is later and

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,780
she's saved up to 20 minutes per day for

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,990
people miss typing their passwords and

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,850
just having to retype them later which

00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,610
is I know maybe just it just happened to

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:15,020
me every day but maybe it was just me

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:18,410
our next hero the jump Superman jump

00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,790
Superman yeah I know it doesn't have a

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,850
code but it's like it's like three lines

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:26,239
of code anyway jump Superman basically

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,320
allows you to connect the machines very

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,110
very quickly while you're debugging

00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,910
signing and he saved ten minutes per

00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,880
debugging session per day per engineer

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,110
which is like gazillions otherwise it

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,080
would have had to look the stuff up on

00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:42,019
the AWS console blah blah blah blah and

00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,110
now this is my favorite one this is a

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,549
this is a account switcher man he allows

00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,860
us to easily switch between account

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:52,010
between our production account and our

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,750
development accounts and this guy saved

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,720
an entire weekend by preventing

00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,959
execution on production several times an

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,420
amazing guy but this this one's my

00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,959
personal favorite this is Wi-Fi woman

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,160
and this a little bit a little bit more

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,320
code just like I mean like ten line

00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,900
something like that and what this does

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,880
is that turns off turns your Wi-Fi off

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,510
and on when you don't have a steady

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:21,109
internet connection and for those of you

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,360
who might remember when when Mac OS

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:24,830
Sierra came out this was like a big

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,860
issue and she literally saved millions

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,379
of Macs

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,900
from being thrown against the wall after

00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,220
the Ciara release and if you don't by

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,169
the way that's anybody here recognize

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:40,949
the woman in the picture that one that's

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:43,860
Hedy Lamarr Hedy Lamarr is the person

00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:47,009
basely came up with all a lot of ideas

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,810
in radio that we use today for Wi-Fi so

00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:52,740
google that afterwards so where our

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:56,150
takeaways make things that remove

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,129
friction even if they get going glory

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,889
take away number two give credit to

00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:04,289
tools that remove friction even if they

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,930
are not technical marvels for Gerry

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:13,880
thank you

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:19,009
[Applause]

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,009
