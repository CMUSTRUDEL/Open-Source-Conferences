Title: How to design your team for scale - Adi Shacham Shavit - DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2018
Publication date: 2019-01-03

Description: 
	When people talk about scale, they immediately think it means scaling in traffic, or sales growth. But there are many different intentions when talking about scale. Things like expanding teams and dividing them into squads, or technological expansion, or expanding business or product lines. All these are scaling up, but they mean very different things.

So as a leading engineer, you need to first identify what the scalability issue at hand is and what the tech team needs to do in order to solve this problem. Next, you need to tailor a technological solution per issue, which means implementing new processes, teams, internal tools, and execution plans to scale successfully.

hi my name is Alicia hum Chevette head

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,880
of R&D at laminate I'm very excited to

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:17,330
be here you've been in tech conferences

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,550
before so you know it's a great place to

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:23,160
to learn new things and meet people from

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,519
the industry most of the talks are

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:30,539
usually about two things either

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:34,230
extremely deep technologies or 200,000

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,120
feet of vision and managerial stuff but

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,989
what about everything in between

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,460
what about everyone in between this

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,649
session is not going to talk about

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:49,110
either one of them I'm shooting down

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,469
many excellent technical people at the

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,559
audience with extremely good coding

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,300
understanding and experience with the

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,890
system architecture that would like to

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,129
understand how to take del callao to the

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,170
next level so this session is especially

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,860
for you it should help you understand -

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,570
not only how to scale your system but

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:16,020
how to scale your team to support the

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:19,530
company needs ok so I started my career

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,150
almost 20 years ago worked in many

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,960
companies some of which do not exist

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,840
anymore I worked for many many years in

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,220
a company called the live person started

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,970
when there were 60 people

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,610
I left when there was 900 I didn't move

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:39,210
to a company called Apps flyer is the

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,970
10th person in the company yeah as the

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,520
10th person in the company building

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,670
talented team and left after three and a

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,979
half years when we had 70 people in the

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,020
team and a system that scaled from -

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:57,060
from handling 200 million events per day

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,640
to 20 billion events per day I joined

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,200
lemonade a little more than a year ago

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,469
to take part in a company that is

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,030
changing the insurance industry and this

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,910
is the first time for me to work in a

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,840
b2c company and I learned from the

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,300
inside that

00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:19,420
different companies has different

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:22,930
scaling challenges so for many years

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:27,550
developers were responsible to write

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,959
code test it and create an artifact that

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,239
the operation team would deploy to the

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,739
production and operation team or

00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:40,000
responsible for the system itself

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:43,209
developer were working on product that

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,890
the product team were planning and

00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,920
tested together with the QA and

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,060
operation team were responsible to make

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,000
sure that the system is up and running

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:56,200
that is scaleable stela by stable sorry

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,440
Hamlet silient it was mostly optimized

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,860
for the day-to-day work and enable the

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,110
dev team to focus on product delivery

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,530
and the operation team to focus on the

00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:11,319
system but and this is a big but you

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,150
can't really have stable scalable

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,360
resilient system if you don't plan for

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:20,380
it and operation knowledge is not enough

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,970
if to solve production issues and a good

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,260
understanding of the business and the

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,700
code is also required

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:30,340
so this dev operation model was far from

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,370
being optimal and the movement toward

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,420
working together started and then in

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,820
2009 the term DevOps was coined and the

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,579
first DevOps day is held and we even

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,810
have Stephen here with us today that is

00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:49,200
one of the co-founders I'm sure you all

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,310
familiar with the DevOps concept and

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,420
different companies has different

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:58,570
implementation but what's definitely is

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:01,150
show between everyone is the walk - yeah

00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,590
no well let's spend some time to

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,989
understand what's the impact for the

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,130
business was it good for the business so

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:12,190
when we had two different disciplines

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,840
the business could get answers like yeah

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,200
it will take two days to fix this back

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,570
or to create this new functionality that

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,030
you client needs but we can deploy to

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,550
production in the next release in six

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,129
months or we'll need

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:31,479
six weeks of Qi cycle before we can

00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:33,699
deploy to production it's obvious that

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,099
the DevOps model not only makes us

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,650
better developers but also is good for

00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:40,150
the business ending its enable faster

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,419
time-to-market

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,819
lower failure rate and faster mean time

00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:48,280
to recovery let's see how taking DevOps

00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:54,099
concept into the organization the entire

00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:58,270
organization can help us so what do you

00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:59,860
think when I say scale so so when I say

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:04,300
scale like what's the first thing that

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:09,819
is pop up into your mind headache well

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:11,409
more yeah greater numbers so so yeah

00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:14,680
most of the technical people will think

00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:19,659
about additional traffic about this

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,539
liberty' system about more events that's

00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:26,169
the first thing that will pop up into in

00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:29,529
mind my purpose is to my purpose here is

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:33,580
to share and show different type of

00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:36,849
scaling and the challenges in each type

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:41,710
of scale and how you as senior engineer

00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:45,219
can help your company to tackle it so I

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,990
had my share of scheduling Dale it was a

00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:49,599
lot it's a lot of fun to work in

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:53,529
fast-growing company and take part of

00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:56,560
its scaling but it's sometimes I can

00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:59,319
look back and understand the tie like we

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,379
didn't do the optimal thing for this

00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:04,900
scale type it happened to me more than

00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:07,690
once and I am proud of my mistakes

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:13,659
because it helped me learn and go let me

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:16,509
share a few so like many startups

00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:20,099
LivePerson start with a monolith it was

00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:23,440
Java Java based web application that

00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:28,360
served the visitors the chats the

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,520
operators everything as the team grow we

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,070
start experiencing quality problems and

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,110
then around 2012 we decided to collect

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,820
all the unit tests together with some

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,930
integration tests and put it as part of

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:44,050
the build

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:46,150
so the build will compile the classes do

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,070
additional steps and then run the test

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,289
before it declares about failure or

00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,169
success so it was a great idea that

00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:57,100
enable us to see not only the code

00:06:53,169 --> 00:07:00,280
compilation went well but also that we

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:03,130
didn't put new bugs into production well

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,750
yeah it was a great idea but the only

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,630
thing that wound the party is what that

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:10,030
instead of taking that it now tuck 30

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,940
minutes so instead of taking ten minutes

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,479
for the compilation we added additional

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,810
twenty minutes

00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:18,550
and before every bug fix was deployed to

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,310
the testing environment so it was a

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,270
great idea but we added even more time

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,930
to the already too long build process

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:29,560
let's see another one

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:32,260
so in abstract we had real-time reports

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,310
from the very first day it was one of

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,139
the more important business affairs and

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:42,160
marketing people would buy the service

00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:44,110
to analyse campaign as they go we had a

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,650
system that was built when we just had a

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,360
few clients for small clients that used

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:56,080
MongoDB in an optimal way but by

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:58,150
increasing counters its it was fine and

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,740
then we got more and more clients and

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,199
more traffic and more and more huge

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:06,039
clients and then it didn't hold the

00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:09,699
traffic very well and actually started

00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:12,010
to fail every few weeks we added more

00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:14,110
compute power and splitted the cluster

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,800
and in some Oh hacks that actually

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:20,139
bought us some L until one day two of

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,539
our largest client could not actually

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,729
fetch data for last week and could only

00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:27,099
see today's data that was the time I

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:32,430
realized we should have planned the next

00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:35,110
generation in time and this is a scaling

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:37,150
mistake for my house so you can see my

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,940
ceiling this is how my ceiling looks

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:45,640
like after three days or non-stopping

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:49,839
rain and ten days ago so my foods fine

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,050
for many years and could hold for too

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,910
many winters and

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,459
all the rain and everything was fine and

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,200
but it got older and eventually just

00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:59,810
couldn't keep up with the the nonstop

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,180
rain and we found ourself putting balls

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,560
under the ceiling and just wiping the

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,810
flow from rainwater at 3:00 a.m.

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:11,769
Saturday night so it turns out you can

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:16,060
also have production problems at home so

00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:19,910
let's see what sir the different scale

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,709
scale types I think you can divide them

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:26,480
into three categories it would be

00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:30,230
traffic team and territory let's deep

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,380
dive into each one of them see the the

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:37,310
specific technical challenges and how

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:39,890
you as leading technology can help your

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:42,079
company tackle them so it starts with

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:46,339
the first one that's the most known one

00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:47,990
its traffic scale it's very easy to

00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:50,390
identify the traffic scale you see

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,820
growing number of events going number of

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:56,300
visitors going number of registered

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,120
clients and more the technical

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:03,110
challenges can can be different so you

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,110
might see services that are just can't

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:09,399
serve anymore or degradation in the

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,399
performance DB or

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:20,300
additional 500 response from the lbs and

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:23,060
more it's absolutely necessary for you

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:26,230
to be able to handle the visitors when

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:29,839
they are coming so they will still get

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:33,290
response so auto scaling is definitely

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,320
mandatory as well as the lastik DB

00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:38,720
real-time to be sewing offering

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,620
processes from the other hand can wait

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:47,240
so they can catch up when when the pic

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:50,380
goes down that's fine and as much as I

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,870
hate to say it you might also leave

00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,870
service list refactor site because you

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,750
might anyway need to already write

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:03,370
services from scratch or redesigning the

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,370
entire system very soon

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,070
as for the team well you will probably

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,779
need multi members because you will need

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,410
to invest substantial amount of team

00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:16,560
members to scale the infrastructure but

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,839
if you consider using automation then

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,120
you might be able to bring less people

00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,980
to the tables so this is a time to think

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,019
about automation this is a time to think

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,410
about also scaling this is the time to

00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,130
think

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:31,490
DevOps and create good automatic

00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,490
toolings

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:43,620
second one is team scaling so this is

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:47,819
something that is obvious but in some

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:50,160
cases company tend to ignore the impact

00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:56,130
of scaling the team for the technology

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:59,040
side I also see technical people tend to

00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,430
ignore that scaling as well and think

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,709
about it more as a managerial problem

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:07,500
this is not sure if you see yourself as

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:12,329
part of the R&D leadership then you must

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,370
take part of this scaling you you

00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:16,920
definitely want to join and take part of

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,050
how your team handle it let's see some

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,899
of the challenges inside the scaling

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,839
type so the first one will be more

00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:28,470
different different functions that are

00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,899
joined to the team for example I tend to

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,180
hire more generalists for as the first

00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:36,839
team members and then most specialists

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,149
when the team grow or you might get full

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,660
team of developers before you start

00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:44,579
hiring QA people these are different

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,689
people with different requirement then

00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:52,370
they might need different dev tools the

00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:55,529
second one is manual processes so it

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,510
might be ok to do some manual tweaking

00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,300
in the database when it was in the

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,680
production database when it was just you

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,610
but when you get four people that are

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,180
working with you

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:08,790
you should automate this process it's

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:12,300
not it's not good anymore the system

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,890
itself so for the system this is a major

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,900
one

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,630
the system was working well for you and

00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:21,330
he was serving you and and you could get

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,890
developers working on the system but you

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,590
get more and more hands right now

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,940
working on the same system and that's

00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,390
something that you definitely need to

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,460
consider so some companies tend to use

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,720
the same code base for everyone in the

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,120
same system for everyone

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,900
and force engineering quality by having

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,500
more tests

00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:43,590
code reviews and things like that some

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,990
companies tend to split big serve a big

00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:49,610
service to sub services so each team can

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:52,800
get a responsibility for sap service I

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,690
usually tend to split services but the

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,010
first approach was taking but some of

00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,320
the largest companies in the world is

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:01,530
working perfectly well for them so it's

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,360
definitely valid and and the last thing

00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:08,250
that I think you should take care of is

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,240
the knowledge knowledge and knowledge

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,380
sharing

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:16,020
I think investing in first good training

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,910
definitely pays itself off in lemonade

00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,700
we have three months of boot camp for

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,260
new employees when they are writing code

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,260
in different part of the system moving

00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:29,100
from team to team and learn the lemonade

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,050
way to work with the product also peer

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,350
code review is something that I think it

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,930
will help the knowledge sharing and try

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,790
to avoid too complicated best practices

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,010
and either spend the time to write

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:47,040
script or very good instructions like

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:51,630
the first computer installation the

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,280
fealty will be for territories in some

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,800
cases the company start from one

00:14:53,280 --> 00:15:00,480
location and then expanding to the to

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:03,990
another location when it's more than

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,480
just says and organizational challenge

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:09,210
it might be also technical challenge

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,220
let's take lemonade for example we start

00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:17,000
in the US and are expanding now for

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:19,980
Europe we start having discussions like

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,900
data consideration and production

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,140
location and that means it's also

00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,529
technical challenge not just

00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,989
organizational challenge

00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:31,089
so so let's see our challenges over

00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:34,179
there so the first one is like I'm sure

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:38,589
you all know is the GDP L in u.s. there

00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:42,639
is no any GDP our related stuff the

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:45,479
second one will be languages and culture

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,489
so we are using chatbot as a service as

00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:50,439
customer service and our English version

00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,329
is not valid anymore when we move to

00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:54,399
Europe and the last one will be

00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:57,069
additional product lines because for

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,719
company like us the tenderly insurance

00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:00,519
then moving to different location means

00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,919
totally different product line and it

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:06,159
also opened a discussion whether or not

00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:08,909
we need a different data center in

00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:16,299
different location and sync between

00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:18,759
between both their locations let's let's

00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:20,739
deep dive to the data center location

00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,989
for a minute because it's an important

00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:28,149
one it's used to be performance

00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:30,399
performance issue and it might still be

00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:33,129
the case if your product is very very

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,809
sensitive to performance but in most

00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:38,799
cases is usually coming from different

00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:44,369
stuff it's it'll use specific lines

00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:48,639
needs or some regulatory consideration

00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:51,639
in most cases the legal team can find

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:55,869
reasonable solution to help you and keep

00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:58,720
just one data center location let's take

00:16:55,869 --> 00:17:01,389
our example we're going to use EU u.s.

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,480
privacy shields to enable us to use just

00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:06,879
our current data center and avoid the

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,740
complexity of any need to sync between

00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:13,809
data centers in real time it's important

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,889
fashion and it's important for you to

00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:20,439
take it with the legal team let's

00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:23,559
understand how to analyze the situation

00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:28,509
and how to analyze your system your

00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:29,889
company store situation and tackle it so

00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:31,990
we start with the first question the

00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:32,529
first one is is it temporary or here to

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:37,509
stay

00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:38,800
do you see growing number of new cells

00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:42,190
in the pipeline

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:45,160
is your team expected to double itself

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,580
in next year according to the budget

00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,610
plan is going to Europe is just a felf

00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:54,250
at the first phase of expanding to other

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:59,230
places in the world if the answer is yes

00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:02,050
then your experience our scale issue the

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,520
second one is what type of scale let's

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:07,870
go back to the three T's and ask

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:12,370
yourself is it traffic team territory or

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:13,690
maybe a combination of some of them now

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:19,120
it's time for you to be honest with

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:22,870
yourself and think really carefully do

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:26,170
you find yourself things like we can do

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:31,830
it or our current infrastructure cannot

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:35,440
support it well as growing to be leading

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:38,260
technical engineer you should be able to

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,140
communicate things to the business in

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:44,500
the way that will make the discussion

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,000
very productive it's important to give

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,530
this information to the business in the

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,320
words the business can understand and

00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,480
learn from you in our case it was

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,550
obvious that going to Europe is a lot of

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,429
work but saying it is a lot of work

00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:00,040
doesn't help anyone by doing very good

00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:02,890
deep gap analysis we're able to say

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,660
things like our current payment system

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,640
doesn't support person you pay out

00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,190
someone in Europe and we'll need

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,710
something that we need to solve or we

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:15,370
can do everything in the same headcount

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:18,520
if we can pay a little more to host our

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:23,620
database in external service and save us

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,929
hours of maintenance every month you

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,710
need to come and understand how to

00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:32,650
communicate to the business how to map

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,720
the challenges and the gaps and have

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:38,320
this discussion it's important for the

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,300
business to understand what's the

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,100
implication of the decision before

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,400
taking the decision and it's also lets

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:48,100
you impact the decision and it also lets

00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,590
you and learn which kind of compromise

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,980
is valid in your company and which one

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,980
is not

00:19:53,450 --> 00:20:00,480
plan and execute so this is a time for

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,549
plan this is the time for action I'm

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,980
going I'm not going to say it's easy and

00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:08,970
probably taking small steps is the right

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:11,280
way to go you are as always technology

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,350
is enable for the business and you plan

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,510
should reflect that it should have all

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:21,299
the scaling killer and only them the it

00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,760
might be the time to leave some of the

00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:27,120
industry best practices outside of the

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,400
plan for example this manolito at your

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,650
company started with might be still

00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:36,600
valid if that's not the crucial scaling

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:38,580
scaling point and that might be might be

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:46,110
possible to weight it with that for a

00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:49,350
later phase so before we wrap up let's

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:53,160
see some scaling in lemonade so lemonade

00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:55,169
was established in order to bring

00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,679
evolution to an industry that wasn't

00:20:55,169 --> 00:21:06,240
