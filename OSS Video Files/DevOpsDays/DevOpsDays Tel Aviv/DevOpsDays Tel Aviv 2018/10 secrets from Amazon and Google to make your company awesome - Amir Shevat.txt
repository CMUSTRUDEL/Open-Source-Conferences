hi everyone asking for introverts to

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,309
raise their hands that's awesome I love

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,309
that idea

00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:20,430
okay hi my name is oh my name is Amir

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,949
Scott I'm gonna talk about ten secrets

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,330
from slack Google and amazona actually

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,939
not going to talk about secrets it's a

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,220
lie everything that I'm going to talk

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,430
about is public information and if you

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,380
do research you can actually find it but

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,680
it's really hard to find and consolidate

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,809
all that so we'll see at the end we'll

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:48,719
do an NPS and see if you're satisfied

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:50,520
you want me to do like this awesome so

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,920
this is me I'm sorry you have to see me

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:59,340
choice and my role right now I'm the VP

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,469
of developer experience I actually don't

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,690
do Deverell I have a Devereaux team but

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,280
I also have an engineering team in a

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,970
product team and our partnership team

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,720
and our my job is to help developers

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:16,820
small developers like Blizzard Riots

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,810
Triple A games to integrate with twitch

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,640
but let's start with a little bit of

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,640
history this is going to be short I

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,820
promise you so I worked at a small

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,130
company called Microsoft before that I

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,490
had a few startups sold one crashed

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,329
another two and then from Microsoft I

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,619
moved to Google it was a I spent five

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,689
years at Google it was an awesome

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,990
awesome opportunity work started at

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,899
Google here opened campus Tel Aviv if

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,509
you know the Google campus that was fun

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,149
I co-founded that and then moved to the

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,159
States to run campuses and open up

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,490
campuses and launch pads around the

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,460
world there was a lot of fun then joined

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,200
a small startup we were a hundred people

00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,390
not sure how to do a platform and I was

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,890
tasked to create a platform for slack so

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,259
if you're using slack and you have

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,429
thoughts connected into slack and tools

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,730
connected into slack

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,020
that's probably my team's work and if

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,430
you're wrong if you're

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,160
bad at distinguishing between

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,840
correlation and causation you would say

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,290
that I probably choose companies because

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,020
of the color of their logos but now I'm

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,690
going to show you why that's not correct

00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:30,330
so the next one was twitch which is

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:34,620
totally off the chart how many of you

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,720
use twitch okay awesome if you don't

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,410
know what twitch is twitch is a

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,000
community platform for streaming videos

00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:45,330
specifically game videos and it lets

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,670
people play their favorite game create a

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,490
community around their game a fortnight

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,710
is one of the biggest games that we have

00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:56,160
and have viewership and if you think oh

00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:58,590
that's a niche thing only a fortnight

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,930
has been watched in the first six months

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:06,660
of this year 17,000 years of watching

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:10,110
that's 2 hours per man woman and child

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:13,050
in the entire European Union okay and

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,960
that's one game okay it is an Amazon

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,530
company so I work at Amazon it was

00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,560
acquired for a billion close to a

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,530
billion dollars three years ago I this

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,620
presentation I'm not representing twitch

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,650
or Amazon I'm representing myself and

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,340
again everything is public because I

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,890
have a lot of time I also write books

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,690
so I wrote a with O'Reilly which is an

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,940
awesome publisher I wrote a book about

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,010
BOTS building conversational interface

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,280
things like messenger BOTS

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:50,610
slack BOTS and Alexa and Google home

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,740
bots and recently I just wrote another

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,590
book about designing Web API is that

00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:59,420
developer love that was fun

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:03,330
okay so I gather a lot of work and a few

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:05,370
semi successful companies and learned

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,930
that you learn a few things there and

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,870
what I I've been writing this

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,360
presentation in my in my head for a

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,190
while now the keys I'm going to tell you

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,170
things that work really well in these

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,420
companies some of them are conflicting

00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,359
between two companies but the the end

00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,240
goal of this presentation is to give you

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,820
what successful companies do in multiple

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,980
areas and you can take in

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,510
choose what you want some of these will

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,160
work for big companies some of these

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,350
will work for small companies but the

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,660
keys to learn here and to think what

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:41,520
could be useful for me how many of you

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:45,380
work in startups ok about 30% how many

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:51,270
of you work in big enterprises wow about

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:56,130
forty five point six percent and the

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:58,320
rest are not working or work okay one

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:02,010
trippin ORS SME is okay there's a lot of

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,180
just came for the cookies okay so let's

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,890
get started

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:10,020
we're gonna focus on three things team

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,670
product and operations okay so that's

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,470
the three themes that we're gonna focus

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:19,140
these best practices on when we talk

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,720
about teams we're gonna focus on people

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,610
a word a word in English that I don't

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,730
think is translated into Hebrew in any

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,650
way called alignment if you can think of

00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,630
the word I think is shoe or Marshall

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,690
because I know that sounds too military

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:37,680
to me communication and literate

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:40,500
leadership okay so the first one it's

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,680
all about the people if you go to any

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,940
Silicon Valley company the biggest cost

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,740
is people in salaries it is the biggest

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,420
cost because it's hiring is very

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,660
expensive keeping people is very

00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:57,390
expensive having bad people is very

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,610
expensive so there's a lot of aspect to

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:04,410
make sure that you have the right set of

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:09,930
people so now this this is some of the

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:12,570
best practices do do spend a lot of

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,900
money and time on hiring the right

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:17,670
people at Google at slack at most of the

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,160
companies in the Silicon Valley you do

00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,920
between four and eight interviews per

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,740
candidate that is a very very expensive

00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,110
but works really well because you have a

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,670
big panel of people that met the

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,530
candidate and could express their

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,900
opinion there's a we have something

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,970
called a panel so you choose people will

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,560
interview the candidate they entered

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,470
they all interview the candidate and

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,050
then they meet together and sit and say

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,510
thumbs up thumbs down and what there's

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,160
tools that provide you that service and

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,990
then you talk about what what is about

00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,510
what is good about the candidate and

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,610
what is challenging about the candidate

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,620
what Amazon does that I really like is a

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,720
bar raiser program and you can read

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,840
about that the idea is that one person

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,880
in the panel they their job is to make

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,860
sure that we're not fudging it that

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,380
we're not cheating ourselves that this

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,570
person is above the bar their job is

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,950
basically not to hire this person unless

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,050
they're amazing

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,240
right so make sure that you have someone

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,100
in your team whose job it is sometimes

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,500
you get into the mindset of like oh we

00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,310
have to hire so it's okay to have not

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,650
awesome people

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,810
this person is job is only to hire

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,730
awesome people at Google and slag

00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,550
there's a process called back-channeling

00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,560
the process is I'm sure in Israel you we

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,990
do that all the time which is call

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,880
someone who knows that person and get

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,210
some information about that person at

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,980
Amazon that's not allowed that's a bad

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:45,030
candidate experience but Google and

00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:47,250
slack do that all the time on the on

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,130
diversity this is super important and

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:53,640
it's important to aspects one of them is

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,080
to have a diverse panel I was working at

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,140
Google at the time and we had a

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,250
candidate somewhere in Europe and four

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:05,190
men four white men said he's awesome the

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:08,270
one marketing manager said what the are

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,590
you crazy he's a jerk

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,780
hiring this person would have been a

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,150
crazy mistake because he wouldn't even

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,729
he wasn't respectful for diverse people

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:20,160
right so make sure that your panel is

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,780
diverse and your candidate pipeline is

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,910
the first make sure that the people you

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,490
bring in you know I don't I'm not

00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:29,010
telling you you must hire diverse people

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:32,070
but I'm saying for every role you should

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,380
have a diverse set of candidates which

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,150
is really important and why is diversity

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,919
important it's not because I've lived

00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,960
for five years in a Silicon Valley and

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,120
I'm politically correct it's there is a

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,360
study that shows that diversity

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,820
contributes to productivity diverse

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,370
teams are statistically more productive

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,339
than on diverse teams so from a business

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,329
perspective that is good for you okay

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,489
now that we've hired the

00:08:54,329 --> 00:09:00,360
best the next stage is to make sure that

00:08:56,489 --> 00:09:03,239
people stay how many of you work in a

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,309
company that has career ladders it's

00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:08,429
very very common in the States but not

00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:10,529
very common in Israel you can put your

00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:12,660
hand down that's okay

00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:15,600
career ladders let people know where

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,699
they are and where they're where they

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,399
can go to this is an example of a

00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:22,499
product manager career ladder it's

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,839
really easy to hire when you have a

00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:26,429
career ladder because I'm when I when I

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,149
work with my team they say yeah we're

00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:31,709
looking for an L six pm and I already

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:33,989
know what's the title and what's the

00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:36,029
requirement when people want to get

00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:38,339
promoted they go to the career ladder

00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:40,110
and understand what what are the type of

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,819
requirements that they need to have in

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,709
the next level when you have growth

00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:46,249
conversation with someone you go into

00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:50,730
the career ladder super super useful and

00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:53,970
then we're all improvement we're all

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,610
improving growth mindset if you haven't

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:59,189
read that this about this topic is super

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,230
important growth mindset is an

00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:03,959
assumption that we're not static that

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,389
you can always improve this is something

00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:08,040
that if you give your the your people

00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,809
and if you tell your people they

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,999
actually do improve there was a study

00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:14,939
that shows that kid that had growth

00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:17,639
growth mindset had better outcomes so

00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:21,059
you develop growth mindset by providing

00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,739
feedback and peer bonuses for example

00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,839
Google there's peer bonuses you can give

00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:27,389
a pure bonus to anyone for something

00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,329
that good that they've done and give

00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:33,449
feedback that is objective and focused

00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:36,029
don't say hey you're a douchebag say hey

00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:38,189
when you you're you're using bad words

00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:41,910
when you're doing your security review

00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:43,709
and that is not effective because people

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,160
don't like to work with you then okay so

00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:51,750
think about the don't pass judgment talk

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:54,870
about outcomes sorry

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,600
and you're a douchebag yep sorry cool

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:02,459
next one is alignment alignment is a

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:06,149
very foreign word in in Hebrew we come

00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:08,550
from we come from a world where it's

00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:10,920
zero-sum game in Israel most of our

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,870
culture a zero-sum game I win you lose

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,970
or the other way around

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,649
alignment is what my kids kids are

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,529
taught in school which is let's create a

00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:23,160
win-win-win situation how can we create

00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:26,220
a deal that incentivizes you to work

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,620
with me or at the end we both win this

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,329
is important in three areas working with

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,610
employees and making sure that employees

00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:34,680
are happy working with partners there's

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,050
many times I see Israeli startups come

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,259
and they say yeah we have a great

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:43,019
product you should buy it that's not

00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:44,399
useful at all right the fact that you

00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,360
have a great product that's awesome go

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,240
sell it somewhere else

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,790
the way to create an alignment to say we

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,279
think that you have this pain and we can

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:56,100
help you with your pain with our product

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,800
it's the same thing only when you're not

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,439
focusing on yourself you're focusing on

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,309
the pain and the need of the other side

00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:07,199
there is something called wifm which is

00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,809
a radio station that is focused on

00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:11,879
what's in it for me and everybody is

00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:13,920
tuned into that radio station in our

00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,600
mind right so when we're having this

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,559
conversation were always tuned to that

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,420
radio station always try to tune to the

00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,370
other person radio station so I'm seeing

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,850
a few confused face because I'm saying

00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,649
alignment you should come in in a in

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,009
this event I want to give you an example

00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:35,480
from Google so here's the problem

00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:38,490
statement employees like to fly business

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,519
but that's expensive and company do not

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:44,759
want them to fly business and Googlers

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,759
are we love to fly business and it's

00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,980
important to keep people happy so Google

00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,069
came up with a solution that creates a

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:56,069
perfect alignment between what they want

00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:57,689
and what the employees want and created

00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:00,899
incentives for that how do they do that

00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:02,819
it's pretty complex so walk with me you

00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,559
get a budget to fly somewhere let's say

00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:04,819
you need to do a business trip to Paris

00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,539
from

00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:11,299
from Tel Aviv you get they say you get

00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:14,899
$500 that $500 puts you between business

00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:18,439
but not enough it's between business and

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:20,389
premium economy now Google says this for

00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:23,269
every dollar for every dollar that you

00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:25,579
save half of that dollar goes back to

00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:28,639
the company and half of that dollar goes

00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:30,229
to your next flight so as it now you're

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,339
starting to do this the math right I'm

00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:36,470
Israeli going to Paris business sucks

00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:37,850
right nobody cares about business when

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,529
you go to Paris because it's like old

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,779
chairs and stuff like that but when I go

00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:44,059
cross the Atlantic that's where business

00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:46,069
kicks in and the value kicks in so I'm

00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:48,679
gonna be very I'm gonna be a cheap

00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:51,589
bastard and buy all the very very cheap

00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:53,509
flights in order to when I cross the

00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:57,289
Atlantic get the business flight right

00:13:53,509 --> 00:14:00,410
so now I'm highly motivated as a Googler

00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:02,720
to save a lot of money for my company

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,179
because I'm getting the business flights

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,129
right now the company saves on every

00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,229
time I'm doing this transaction we

00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:11,059
created a perfect alignment between the

00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:13,729
needs of the company to save money and

00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:16,459
the needs of the employees to get

00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:18,889
comforters seating and they work towards

00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,689
the company goals in a very happy place

00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,459
right so this is an example you could do

00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:23,899
this for everything you do by the way

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:25,909
you can do it with your friends and

00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:28,100
spouses when you think about how to

00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:29,989
align incentives so I just improved your

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,749
quality of life and relationship with

00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:36,309
the world think about that when you do

00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:38,749
the MPS when you give this course okay

00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:41,269
this is well this is something that I

00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:43,279
found very useful which is always be

00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:45,829
communicating we have this knowledge of

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,439
what what we know in our mind is is

00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:51,049
known but most people outside of our

00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:53,389
world of this world do not have the same

00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:56,929
knowledge it is very important to always

00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:59,600
be communicating very thoughtfully and I

00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:02,449
want to give you a few examples slack

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,549
has a radically transparent way of

00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:07,069
communicating they have a slack channel

00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:09,799
inside slack in the company they have a

00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:12,439
slack channel called biz ops and there's

00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:15,019
multiple bots that post into this bot on

00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:17,089
a daily basis what is our arr

00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:18,089
what is our churn rate how many users

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:20,939
new

00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:23,160
how many users have left us on an

00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:25,879
ongoing basis the intern couldn't see it

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,470
and the CEO could see it radically this

00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:32,209
transparent communication then there's

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:35,279
Amazon shareholder letter I've seen PM's

00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:37,410
quote the shareholder letter when they

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,110
make product decisions right so it's

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,519
very important to be because our

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,850
leadership provides a very clear

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,509
guidance and thought when they share

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:50,399
Google Microsoft actually had a internal

00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:53,129
podcast for tech people to learn about

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,290
their products so when you're commuting

00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:57,209
you hear about the products and get

00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,300
updated so that was an awesome way to

00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:04,290
communicate and TGIF who here knows what

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,569
TGIF is thank God is Friday so here's

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:09,420
the quiz and I have a prize for the

00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:13,439
person who's providing the full answer

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:18,559
for the quiz which day is TGIF in

00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:23,879
Mountain View Thursday why Thursday

sorry sorry the day before Friday ok so

00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:36,839
the answer is here I'm gonna get this

00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:38,999
anyway the answer is what yeah so the

00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,759
answer is thoughtful communication and

00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:43,019
when you do in Mountain View when you do

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,429
a presentation on Friday

00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:49,110
it's Saturday in Sydney in Sydney so

00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:50,670
thoughtful communication you can have

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,929
that because you want to do it in the

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,839
first place

00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:56,910
it is Friday in the world because you

00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,470
don't want people to come at the weekend

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,089
to listen to what saying something that

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,100
is it very important for those of you

00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:05,779
who don't know what TGIF at Google is is

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:10,500
Larry and Sergey the founders of Google

00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:11,939
come every week stand on stage and speak

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,789
about what's important to the company

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:17,760
and bring vp's and other people to talk

00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:22,289
about products and updates think of it

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:26,309
every week 52 times a year for the last

00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:29,700
17 years think about the amount of money

00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:31,590
and time they spend to create that event

00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,510
every single time

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,059
and they do it because it works because

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,500
communication is important okay so we

00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,240
talked you agree we all agree that

00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,940
communication important how can you

00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,429
reduce communication some of you say yes

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,080
you're American you all I'm not American

00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,880
I'm Israeli but you're all about

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,740
communication and speaking whereas

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,380
really we we can we know what other

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,970
people say and we don't want to talk to

00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,500
a lot of other people right we're

00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,220
introverts were the eleven people that

00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:02,000
raised our hands so what you do is you

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:05,279
create leadership principles because

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,260
vision can help you with coordination to

00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:11,130
reduce coordination if you and I know

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,960
what we both want to achieve we need to

00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,000
let's communicate about why we're doing

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,590
something if we're saying hey we're

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,149
gonna go there and you say okay I'm

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,409
gonna step over there and I'm gonna step

00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:21,090
over there it's much easier because we

00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:25,260
can say hey we're just going into that

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:27,840
direction and here's the example so

00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,820
usually they come in threes mission

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,850
vision strategy sometimes mission and

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:35,760
vision are interchangeable mission is

00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:38,010
your your company's dream where are we

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,730
going in the long term and this is

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,870
googles mission right to organize the

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,000
world's information and make it

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,399
universally accessible and useful

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,899
then there's the vision the vision is

00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:50,370
what are we going to do in the next five

00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:52,559
years where are we going that is

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,659
tangible and that we can do in an in the

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,440
next five years and this is my team's

00:18:54,659 --> 00:19:01,890
goal 100k developers making money on on

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,470
Twitch and then there's the strategy the

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,880
strategy is how how are we going to get

00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,779
there how are we gonna get to the

00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:12,779
five-year plan in order to to reach our

00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:15,570
goal and dream at the end and this is

00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:19,559
the google play strategy from a few

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:22,470
years ago drive 10k apps and Google Play

00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:25,130
focus on tablets and Google TV right so

00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:28,140
that's that's a strategy to get into the

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,120
mission okay does that make sense so

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,460
doing this reduces communication

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,090
unnecessary communication and provides

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,169
you a better experience okay so we

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,940
talked about people and how to

00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:43,679
communicate to them let's talk a little

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,860
bit about products so the key here is

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,049
word

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,700
backward from the customer needs and

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:51,640
this is also important if you're working

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,250
in IT and providing product for internal

00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,170
customers it's good for it for working

00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,720
with your kids and you want to give them

00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,340
better education any any type of thing

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,260
that we do with another person working

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,840
backwards from the customer need is

00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,030
super important usually this is the

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,890
opposite of what actually happens in

00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,590
many companies which is called the ivory

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,470
tower syndrome the ivory tower syndrome

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:17,080
is a p.m. or a manager sitting in his

00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,270
ivory tower and saying this is what is

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,679
good for the masses this is what they

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,020
need

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:27,640
and unless you're Steve Jobs God Reza's

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:29,590
soul you're probably wrong so how do you

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,250
work backwards from the from the

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:35,830
customer so this is two ways of doing

00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,799
that one of them is an Amazon one of

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:42,640
them is used at Google and it's lack in

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:45,220
Amazon it's called a PR FAQ you actually

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,400
start by writing the PR for the feature

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:51,340
or plot so you actually say a TechCrunch

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,900
today twitch releases that at a time and

00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,520
that's like you give the people the

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,320
understanding of what what is what's

00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,140
gonna be the customer value and

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,750
experience then you rot right the FAQ

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,450
the frequently asked questions for your

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,850
customers hey will this work with this

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,250
whoa how do I get on board it you

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,809
actually write all the questions that

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,760
your customers will have about this

00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:14,650
product even the hard questions there's

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,160
something called rude FAQ which is like

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,480
why this sucks why or why's was - are

00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,030
you doing this

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,370
and then you analyze the customer and

00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,650
you provide the at the end you provide

00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:29,559
the spec for the product if I review a

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:31,570
product in my team that doesn't have a

00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,910
working backward document I will demand

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,220
a working backward document when you

00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,320
look at the a product that failed

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,630
usually managers will ask for the

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,160
working backward document to see what

00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,010
was the thinking behind this product

00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,179
okay so very very important Google and

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:49,120
slack there's a something called a

00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:51,520
design sprint there's a Udacity course

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,669
that I created about design sprint it's

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,910
a free course that you can take that

00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:58,480
Google created and here you what you do

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,210
is

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,610
you bring the users and you talk to them

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,890
about the pain or the need then you

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,620
define the user needs you brainstorm

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,210
solutions and you could do voting and

00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,059
stuff like that and you do a little bit

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:16,270
of prototyping and then you bring back

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:18,429
the user to try your prototype number

00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:23,320
one and number five are critical to the

00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:25,809
process so the two to four are a process

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,970
that you can change but one and five is

00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:29,919
super critical because you want to

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,360
understand the user need and then you

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,080
want them to actually test the solution

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,150
to see that you have your not off mark

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:41,140
again there's a course on design sprints

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:42,880
that you can find okay this is

00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,640
controversial but I still believe in

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,830
this single threaded ownership reduces

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,890
politics and makes decisions better and

00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:55,809
this is the obligatory funny meme in

00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:58,299
every presentation so what what I think

00:22:55,809 --> 00:23:00,340
is that ownership is super super

00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:03,549
important if there's no ownership

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:06,190
ownership for products the product is

00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,900
gonna be probably bad the decisions are

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,280
good around the product they're gonna be

00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,020
bad and there's going to be a lot of

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,520
people who are opinionated that

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,620
shouldn't be opinion about the product

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,020
you should have a single for every

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:19,450
product in Amazon and every product at

00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,970
which buy derived there's a single

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,040
threaded owner a person who owns the

00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,340
decisions about that product it's not

00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,929
metric some companies believe in metric

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,790
ownership we believe in a single

00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:33,580
threaded ownership and you need to build

00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:37,090
your company around your philosophy so

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:39,640
there's two philosophies on the left you

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:41,980
have the metric map the metric

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,230
management's so you have the marketing

00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,820
org and you have the product or again

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,549
you have the engineering org and maybe

00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,570
you have many other orgs there and they

00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:54,370
all collaborate together that is good

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:56,350
but what I find is that that that

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,530
there's a lot of overhead in time in

00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,580
order to get someone to to do what you

00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,950
want

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,410
it works in very small companies but as

00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:08,620
you scale it changes when I worked here

00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:12,040
at Google Israel I knew the legal guy

00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,490
because we went to coffee so when I had

00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,620
the

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:18,130
questions I would just say hey dude this

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:20,080
is my question he would axe ask me now

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,940
it's much harder when you when you work

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,620
in a big big company and you have this

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,010
organization that you need to get

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,360
support for so the way Amazon works is

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,410
that there's a single-threaded leader

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:34,210
under it you have the team that needs to

00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:37,690
support that org and the engineering

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:40,090
team needs to be a to pizza size team so

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,460
the key here is that the team shouldn't

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,980
be bigger than the amount of people that

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,840
can consume two pizzas now from my

00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,670
perspective I can probably consume two

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,940
pizzas so I don't know if I subscribe to

00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:54,970
that theory but let's say around slice

00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,700
or two purpose for two people

00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:03,030
so that you can get the order of

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:07,530
magnitude of the size of teams okay

00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:09,370
next secret instruments everything yeah

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:12,460
here people here know what

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,350
instrumentation is so instrumentation

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,870
for those of you who don't is putting

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:19,690
measurements on products in a way that

00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:23,050
you can derive insights from it so let's

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:25,809
say I have a button the buy button on a

00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,970
site you need to instrument how many

00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:30,940
people clicked on it how many people

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:33,309
hovered over it how many people double

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,170
clicked on it how many people touched it

00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:37,059
on mobile and then moved and what was

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,460
the conversion from all these actions

00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:41,530
into actually what you want to the talk

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:45,040
to the bottom of the funnel people who

00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:48,400
click double-click the net made by buy

00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:50,710
more or if we show a blue button it's

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,720
much it's it's performer that

00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,390
performance is much higher than a green

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,330
button so instrument everything this is

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,580
super important because there's a key

00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,380
thing that is called assumption that

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,530
isn't behind everything that we do and

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:09,059
you can move from assumptions to

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:12,280
actually data if you instrument products

00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:14,470
so my theory is that we're celebrating

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,350
when we are launching a product we're

00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,330
celebrating the wrong thing right it's

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:21,040
just like raising funds I don't know why

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,890
people are celebrating raising funds

00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,870
like yeah we have this big debt now and

00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:30,160
we gave away a part of our comp

00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:32,080
yay so I still have I still celebrate

00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,940
with some of my friends who raise funds

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,320
but I don't think that that's the real

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,760
important thing the real important thing

00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,559
is product market fit the same thing

00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,250
about launching launching the first

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,780
product is not the most important thing

00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,940
launching the second product the second

00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:49,330
version of that product that's where you

00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:51,550
actually start to see value version 1.1

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:54,550
is much more important than version 1

00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:56,200
version 1 is just learning hey we think

00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:59,650
you'd like it but if it sucks please

00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,110
tell us through instrumentation but what

00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:04,720
you learn in a good p.m. and a good

00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:06,730
product person is a person that learns

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,530
from instrumentation and constantly

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,120
improves the product does that make

00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:13,780
sense

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:16,270
awesome and Google and Amazon and slack

00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:19,120
run thousands of experiments every day

00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:21,550
always run a be testing people will tell

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,090
you it's B it's not be pleased a B test

00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:28,000
it before you decide Google runs

00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:30,400
multiple shades of colors on every

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,840
button I can tell you that at SLAC we

00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,880
did an experiment that showed that

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,120
people really like to click on green

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,970
green buttons even if it's canceled they

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,040
click on the green button if it's if

00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:44,830
it's bad for them they create click on

00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:48,610
the green buttons so and the shade of

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:50,530
the green is important so I think it's

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,870
super important to always do these type

00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:55,030
of experiments and they're ongoing even

00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,070
even if you think that you've reached a

00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,770
place that you're happy with continue on

00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:02,770
experimenting all the time and create

00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:04,210
green buttons ok so we talked about

00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:06,490
product now let's talk a little bit

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,320
about operations operations are

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:10,809
important and we're here to talk about

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,679
DevOps so but I'm going to talk about

00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:17,590
the software portion of operations by

00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,510
the way too fast too slow perfect you're

00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,010
happy I also have a deck about my life

00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:23,230
in New Zealand I spent two years there

00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:28,530
so this is boring we can switch to that

00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:32,650
just let me know ok so secret number 8

00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:35,020
focus on outcomes not on tasks this is

00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:38,590
super super important a lot of people

00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,460
are married to their roadmap they're

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,779
married

00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,240
best about the Roman what have we

00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:45,580
launched III hear people saying yeah

00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,070
we're launching to product to features

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,570
every week that could be a horrible

00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,820
horrible experience for the customer

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,980
right you should think about what is the

00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,760
right customer experience and how are

00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,130
you doing this

00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,640
I remember having weird conversations at

00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:02,740
SLAC when we told enterprises yes we we

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,890
launched features every week and they

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,169
were like we're working like monthly

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:10,000
basis or quarterly basis you can't do

00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:11,590
that you can't change this we're doing

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,480
training and now you're changing the

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:16,480
product and we need to retrain our team

00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,760
so think about how do you do this and

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,260
work backwards from the problem rather

00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:25,360
than from the formula task so in Google

00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:28,720
and slack there's a something called

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,460
okay ours objective key results and if

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,990
you haven't read about okay ours you

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,809
should definitely read about okie ours

00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,279
most of the valley uses okay ours so you

00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:37,570
set your objective

00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:39,970
Eric quarter you say this is the

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:41,710
objective thing that I'm going to reach

00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:43,450
and these are the key results that I can

00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,940
see that I actually reached that

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,580
objective Amazon uses a different

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,970
strategy for the same thing which is we

00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,710
have a block black box which is reality

00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:55,600
here is the output that we want these

00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,539
are the objective outputs that we want

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,880
out of this black box we can impact the

00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:02,649
output of the outputs but we can create

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,320
inputs inputs are the features and

00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:06,909
products and tasks and programs that

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,720
we're going to do in order to generate

00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:12,010
this output right so let's say that just

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,830
to make it concrete we're going to say

00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,570
hey we want to improve conversion or

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:19,510
let's move it to the DevOps we want to

00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:23,020
say hey we want people to deploy faster

00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:24,370
that's the output fast deployments and

00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,190
how we're going to reach this deployment

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:30,100
we're going to implement this product

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:32,049
and we're gonna write this document and

00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,630
we're gonna do this video showing

00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:36,309
developers how to better deploy right

00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,669
these are the output the output is

00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:40,899
faster deployment or more clients and

00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:44,230
inputs are the things that I'm gonna do

00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:46,750
in order to reach that that targets and

00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:49,960
again do not obsess on the roadmap

00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:52,809
pivots is good changing the plan is good

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:58,539
at an ongoing basis beam be of

00:30:52,809 --> 00:31:00,580
test about your customer needs this is

00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:02,100
another controversial thing but I again

00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,899
still really believe in it

00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:07,240
mechanisms are better than good in tents

00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:09,669
you remember that story with the legal

00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,559
guy that I used to take for coffee let's

00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:13,419
say that guy leaves to another company

00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:17,440
and now I have a person that I don't

00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:19,749
like right now all my thesis on like I'm

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,120
gonna get all my services kind of sucks

00:31:19,749 --> 00:31:23,919
because it was based on good intent on

00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,840
the fact that I have a good relationship

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,639
I'm not telling you not to have a good

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,269
relationship what I'm telling you is

00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:34,149
build processes that work around bad

00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:36,759
relationship or work around like tribal

00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:40,960
knowledge and here's an example this is

00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:45,249
a radical example and I prefixed it or

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:48,700
sorry suffix that with do not try this

00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:51,190
at home this is done at large-scale

00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,019
company this is what Amazon does in

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,919
order to create a review cycle this is

00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:57,820
the mechanisms we do in order to reach

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,610
productivity in the company and to

00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:03,029
measure productivity on a weekly basis I

00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:07,240
do a review with each of my directors

00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:09,999
reviewing the tasks the bugs the ops and

00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,240
the metrics is every week they are

00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:15,970
audited on a monthly basis we audit my

00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,440
entire org and we work on what are the

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,139
key initiatives that we're gonna do this

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,999
core this this month and what is my

00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:23,919
team's performance what is my org

00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:27,190
performance and then on a quarterly

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,830
basis we do another one which is much

00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:32,350
bigger which is a road map review and we

00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:34,720
capture key learnings and move it to the

00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,700
next quarter and understand what we what

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,490
we've done right so and on a yearly

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,080
basis we look at our entire strategy we

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,519
look at what where are we going are we

00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,769
in the right direction should we create

00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:47,200
new products should we kill products and

00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:50,320
that's happening on a yearly basis these

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,119
are all mechanisms in order to make sure

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,960
that we're doing the right thing instead

00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:58,629
of things that we just decided to do

00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,610
right so processes are important some

00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:02,799
people say hey this is like too much

00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:05,200
process heavy that's okay your company

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,279
does not need to do this but think about

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,210
what is the right process

00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:16,599
things that will help you make your life

00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:19,119
better and the last one people really

00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:20,919
don't like to fail when I got to the end

00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,929
when I got when I met was interviewed to

00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,940
twitch my manager said so you think

00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:27,519
you're gonna be successful I said I

00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,649
think I'm gonna fail a lot but I'm gonna

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,139
learn from each failure and I'm not

00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:33,909
gonna do it again that's that's in my

00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:35,289
opinion if we would to say I don't want

00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:37,629
you that that's okay because I was

00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:40,479
transparent I think it's super important

00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:42,460
to learn from your failures failure

00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:45,849
should not be an ensure you're all in

00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:48,879
DevOps servers sometime crash right

00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:51,669
people sometime crash people write code

00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:54,309
that is not good right that's it's okay

00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:55,659
to fail fail is part of our life in the

00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:58,239
Silicon Valley if you haven't failed

00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:59,529
something is wrong usually one of your

00:33:58,239 --> 00:34:01,149
things that you say is that care I

00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:02,859
failed and I learned that this is what I

00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:06,369
learned and I want to show you this is

00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:09,369
something that we do at at twitch which

00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:10,929
is post-mortem post-modern is really

00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:15,339
important because it captures the thing

00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:18,579
like what what am i failing at and how

00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:21,159
did I learn from that so first of all

00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:23,950
you detail the failure people were not

00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,809
able to go into the site and then you

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:28,659
said you measure the customer impact

00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:31,149
which is very important about 10,000

00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:33,250
people came into the site between this

00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:35,589
time and this time and this is the

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:39,520
impact to the user experience and this

00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:42,520
is the impact to our to our company and

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,609
then you do the five why's so it's very

00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,609
easy well we'll play together right I'm

00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:49,089
gonna say something you're gonna say

00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:51,039
awesome

00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:54,730
so people were not able to go into the

00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:59,079
site because our servers were not were

00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:02,260
overloaded because the database had was

00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:04,299
not responding to queries because we

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:09,130
deployed a new schema to the database

00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:11,609
and we didn't update the server code so

00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:15,059
now you go to that so now I'm gonna say

00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:18,970
shrug so that means that we got to the

00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:20,170
root cause so you do if you do you ask

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,359
why until you get

00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:25,059
like yeah that was a really bad idea

00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:28,780
okay so that and that's the root cause

00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:30,490
of the problem so you always write it's

00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,020
the five doesn't need to be five it's

00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,420
not prescriptive you can write any

00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:37,720
anything that you any to any amount of

00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:41,079
wise until you reach the right wise okay

00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,240
set of wise and then the more important

00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,700
than the why didn't Sonny why this has

00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,040
happened we can say hey yeah we didn't

00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,559
do that we should probably do something

00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,059
about it okay goodbye and not do

00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,369
anything about it and I've sync I'm sure

00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:56,619
your company doesn't do that ever but

00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:58,599
some companies other companies they

00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:00,970
forget about the actual learning parts

00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,640
right so the learning part is super

00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:06,010
important and we call it so what okay so

00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,900
we learned that this is happening so

00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:10,750
what so what are you gonna do about it

00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:14,140
so what you do the next stage is like is

00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:16,180
you outline so we know that when you

00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,339
deploy something to the to the database

00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,770
you also need to check if there needs to

00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:22,450
be an update to the server so we're

00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,059
gonna create a script that blocks

00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:26,859
updates the database before you update

00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:28,660
the server right so and we're gonna run

00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:31,000
this and it's not going to be optional

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,680
and we're gonna update the manuals and

00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,500
we're gonna run it a part of our

00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,299
deployment process right so that that is

00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,980
the so what's the so what is super

00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:41,319
important and then you take this doc and

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,380
you get the highest person in the

00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:45,640
company to sign it or the business unit

00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,609
to sign it because they need to

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,109
understand that the team has failed

00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:52,150
radical transparency and that they've

00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:53,819
learned something so now it's an ongoing

00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:58,180
learning process

00:36:53,819 --> 00:37:01,089
aye-aye-aye review and sign multiple of

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,680
these every every month and it's a very

00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:04,480
interesting and useful because it

00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,640
actually reduces error

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,309
ongoing error rates by orders of

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,990
magnitude and then you keep it and you

00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:12,640
know that it's there and that's it's a

00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,440
documented learning and if there's a new

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,290
person they could go if they're really

00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,819
bored they could go over all the old

00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:23,349
learnings and understand what's

00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:25,960
happening there okay so the last point

00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:28,780
this is we went through ten secrets and

00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,329
best practices the last one is this take

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,790
this with a grain of salt look at all

00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:36,820
the learnings that I've shown you but

00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:39,700
what is what works for my company what

00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:43,630
can I take from here and apply to my

00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:46,330
team to my working with other people to

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,770
the processes I have be thoughtful I

00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,810
think that's the key learning that's the

00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:51,580
seek that's the eleven secret if you're

00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,470
thoughtful if you think about this on an

00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:55,960
ongoing basis you will constantly

00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:58,330
improve your org you develop your

00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,770
development and your operations if you

00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:01,990
always think about how can I improve

00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:04,750
what can I learn where did I fail and

00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,820
not be fearful when I hear people saying

00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,510
in an interview I never fail I'm always

00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,260
right

00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:13,960
there other delusional or just came out

00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,900
of college right so and they're probably

00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,570
failed a few times there so what I'm

00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:22,900
saying is that we embrace change and

00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:25,530
embrace learning and take these things

00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,240
and put them and apply them to your own

00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:31,480
company thank you very much

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,610
feel free to reach out to me and ping me

00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,060
on Twitter I'm very available thank you

00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,790
very much

00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,790
do you want you have time for questions

00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:38,790
yes

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,190
[Music]

00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:48,520
so we do post mortems on everything that

00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:50,470
has customer impact so if it's something

00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,869
that if I have a service that failed so

00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:54,940
services fail a lot and we have a micro

00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:57,640
services architecture it is okay for

00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:00,340
service to fail multiple times if the

00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,410
gateway has mitigated the failure and if

00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:06,220
the user wasn't we're not impacted if

00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:07,900
there's a user impact then we then we do

00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,710
the postmortem so that's the order of

00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:13,510
magnitude yes

00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:16,390
so the question was sometimes you

00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:18,820
promised customers roadmap items and

00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:21,250
then things change and you want to stay

00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,830
not married to your to your roadmap but

00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:27,810
it's the we made obligation so that is

00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:31,210
true as a lot of true very much to b2b

00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:33,940
businesses what you do is again come

00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:36,790
back to alignment what you do is say hey

00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,980
listen we want to help you we we promise

00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,869
you this feature but we actually think

00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,000
that solving that problem is more

00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:44,470
important to you so we're gonna delay

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,980
that feature in order to give you that

00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:49,750
that item of the roadmap and let them

00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,330
like have a conversation with them and

00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:56,740
choose with them never ask a user what

00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:58,660
they need analyze their so Ford said

00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,390
that if people were to ask about cars

00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:03,400
they would ask for faster horses right

00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,859
people don't know what they actually

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,810
need they know what what's painful and

00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:10,150
what like what would where they want to

00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:13,000
go so I think the key is to communicate

00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:15,190
with your partner's about roadmap items

00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,560
and explain to them why you're doing

00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:19,240
this right so I think that's what and

00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,800
and if they say no we have to have this

00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:35,290
feature then you should probably have

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:37,740
that feature yes and then you push

00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,740
really hard

00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,619
so you make it work by making it

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,109
something that you progression some

00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:50,840
paper some and you realize that it is a

00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:53,119
box but it's a box that we all agree on

00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,390
right my friend Donna really says that

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,270
we're all unique like everyone else

00:40:55,390 --> 00:41:02,630
right so the key here is that if I know

00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:04,760
where I'm at I and I know my progression

00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,650
I might say hey I have a different I

00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,190
think I'm a five but do you think I'm a

00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:13,070
four let's look at this ladder and see

00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:15,349
what works right so I think at least

00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:18,349
it's very effective in organization I

00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:20,270
work for including Microsoft in Israel

00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:23,270
but I think it's a matter of if somebody

00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:25,190
says I'm not a place in the ladder I'm a

00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,869
free human being that's awesome but you

00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,430
need still need to put him from your

00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:31,970
perspective and some in one of these

00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:33,680
boxes one last thing and one last

00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:36,140
comment on that is that if you want to

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,980
work for an American company make sure

00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:42,680
you know which level they put you on a

00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,690
very common mistake I see for Israelis

00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,480
coming to the valley is they say yeah

00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:50,619
they put me on a I'm a really important

00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:53,270
person I'm a senior manager level four

00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:56,450
that is not a thing

00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:59,180
so make sure that you know which which

00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:01,040
level you're coming to because it's

00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,020
really important at level four you won't

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,240
be able to manage anyone you'll be able

00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:08,349
to manage be portable six and above

00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:11,960
at least under companies I work for yes

00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:13,400
so it's it's a it's a great question so

00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,290
question is how do you do how do you

00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,830
apply all these two small startups with

00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,170
high pressure

00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:20,180
take what you need but put this as a

00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:22,609
bucket of things that you would do as

00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,800
you grow every order of magnitude of

00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:27,320
your growth will need a different set of

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,710
tools when you have one person no career

00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:33,950
ladder I'm the freaking CIO CEO and I

00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:35,900
decide everything then you have ten

00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:38,240
people and you need to start doing who's

00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:41,660
doing what at a hundred people you start

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,490
building an org a 150 people start not

00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,500
knowing other people's names so you need

00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:48,560
to have processes that get people to

00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,599
know each other at a thousand your kind

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,890
of need to have like business units so I

00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:53,720
think the key is to to

00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:56,059
understand to put this as a stack what

00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,670
can I use now and for each order of

00:42:56,059 --> 00:43:00,380
magnitude of growth rethink your your

00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,849
organization I've seen many organization

00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,859
that failed because they didn't realize

00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:06,829
they moved from a thousand to ten

00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:09,170
thousand they said yeah everybody needs

00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:12,220
to agree yes it doesn't work at ten

00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:14,420
thousand so make sure that you know you

00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,430
think about your organization as it

00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:45,109
drops I think we have one more question

00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:47,420
we can do yeah yes yeah that's a great

00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:48,799
question I I heard it twice for this

00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:52,220
presentation so I'm probably need to

00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:54,859
build a slide for that the key is what

00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:57,680
is the minimum amount of processes that

00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:59,839
you could do to be effective that is the

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,269
that is the way I would do it I'll give

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,470
you an example we have something at in

00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:06,559
many companies called an engagement

00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:09,259
survey so we ask our employees or how

00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:12,500
happy they are with working in the

00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:14,329
company in multiple levels right how

00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,099
happy are you with your software how

00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:18,230
happy are you with your dev tools how

00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:20,210
happy are you with all these and then we

00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:22,759
look at the things that are the lowest

00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:26,029
and build processes or solutions just

00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:27,829
for that so when people say yeah we

00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:29,359
don't know what the strategy is it keeps

00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:30,980
changing and I don't know the

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,140
correlation between what I do and how I

00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,789
contribute to the company and I hear

00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,079
that multiple times then you need to

00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:38,930
build a process of mission vision

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,220
strategy and let everybody know how they

00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:44,839
are what they are doing

00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:46,099
connects to do to the work what I one of

00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:49,160
the quotes I really loved is when I

00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:51,470
joined slack the recruiter was so

00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,210
excited about her job she said my job is

00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:56,450
the most important thing in the company
