	00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,200
so good morning so my name is David

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,429
blank Edelman I believe it or not I

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,469
kinda don't believe it work for

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,150
Microsoft where I'm a senior cloud ops

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,070
advocate and I pay a lot of attention to

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,420
site reliability engineering stuff

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,570
s-sorry

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,760
so let me just sort of get a little bit

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,320
of a sense let me just switch my thing

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,000
over here of how many people in this

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,969
room know what site reliability

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,340
engineering is okay that's good

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,280
how many people in this room consider

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,770
themselves to be sres for a living okay

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,559
so look around these are the people you

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,210
want to talk to if I get this wrong so

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,710
you should ask them you know like so

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,420
your job is to keep me honest to make

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,010
sure that I'm gonna say the right stuff

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,809
but those people that don't know what

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,910
sre is let's do some like a little bit

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,170
of a level set just so you understand

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,590
we're the stuff we're talking about

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,809
comes from so this is my best definition

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,940
of what site reliability engineering is

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,519
it's a big block of text I'll read it to

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,799
you but there are three important words

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,570
in this site reliability engineering is

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,340
an engineering discipline devoted to

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,260
helping an organization sustainably

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,689
achieve the appropriate level of

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,310
reliability in their system services and

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,290
products if you would like to help me

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,909
translate that to ev'ry flitter I would

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,740
very much like that that would be very

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,119
cool I would like to be able to show it

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,520
and say I don't know what I don't know

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,259
this so well but this is what it means

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,110
here's the words from this definition

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,740
that I want to highlight the first one

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:38,820
is reliability so my first question for

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,159
you is what's this what is this lag mean

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,750
please raise your hand well I mean I

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,590
worked really hard on this slide so I

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,320
want you know so yes sir yeah holy

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,390
smokes that is the first time in a good

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,860
three years that I've given talks like

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,259
this in which someone has gotten this

00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:00,149
right this is in fact what happens when

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,610
a PHP app errors out or here I'll put

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,890
this on I tend to not put up Java stack

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,299
traces if I can help it just because it

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,640
causes people in the audience to twitch

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,709
a little bit so we'll go back to the PHP

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,209
one because it's nice nice and soothing

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:17,579
so here is the point you can have the

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,379
most amazing application or system and

00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:22,409
service in the world you can pour

00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:25,739
millions billions of shekels and dollars

00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:28,889
into your app it can do so many things

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:31,620
it can walk the dog it can go get your

00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:33,450
dry cleaning it can you know serve in

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,510
the are in the in the army it can do all

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,389
these things but if it's not up it's

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,639
worthless to everyone and all that money

00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:43,829
goes downhill so that's why reliability

00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,889
is the thing that we focus on with SRE

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:48,450
as one of the primary parts of what you

00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:52,049
want to make sure you ensure in your

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:54,629
systems another important word of this

00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:57,000
definition is the word appropriate by

00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,500
appropriate I mean it is almost never

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,450
the case and this is going to be a

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,430
little bit of heresy that you need a

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,909
hundred percent reliability or you even

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,709
want a hundred percent reliability there

00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:09,930
are certain exceptions that though you

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,980
know the things that fly in the air you

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,810
really want them to be a hundred percent

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,470
reliable the thing that ticks in your

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,690
test right you want to make sure that

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,060
that's reliable but you don't need it

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,859
everywhere else and in fact you don't

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,870
want to even try and there are many

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:27,000
reasons for that one reason is as

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,949
chances are even if you create the most

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,030
reliable thing in the world you're going

00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:31,979
to be using something that has

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,239
dependencies and I bet those

00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,449
dependencies are not hundred percent

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,060
reliable or let's assume that I have an

00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:41,729
application and it is on the is on the

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,620
web yeah I don't know what the ISPs are

00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,560
like in Israel are they up a hundred

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,139
percent of the time so there you go

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,389
right so if they're not and you have

00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,099
poured a lot of money into it and York

00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:54,540
and the Pete your users and customers

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,000
can't get to your thing a hundred

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,229
percent at a time it's not worth it so

00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,370
there and there are lots of other good

00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:01,259
reasons that we can talk about why a

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,819
hundred percent is the wrong goal so

00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,919
that's why appropriate is important and

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,439
the final thing I want to say and will

00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,689
point this out later is sustainably it

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,459
is the case that you cannot create

00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:13,560
reliable systems and you'll hear me say

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,070
this again from people that are burnt

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,859
out from people that cannot continue to

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,750
run your systems it's just not possible

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,540
in fact it's not even desirable it's not

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,160
even ethical to do this so it's really

00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,980
to come up with a practice that you can

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,990
sustain not something where we go all

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,000
out all the time and at the end you just

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,460
have somebody who is over in the corner

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,600
who has been in you know has been extra

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,890
fried so okay so Saeng reliability

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,690
engineering is trying to deal with this

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,970
push-pull this this sort of tug-of-war

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,340
thing that goes on in DevOps as well

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,530
where on this side you have the people

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,930
who are responsible for creating the

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,730
software whose job it is to iterate the

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,160
software to write more to add features

00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,320
to make it do things and on this side

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,790
you have the group of people whose job

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,580
it is to make sure that that software

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,590
runs reliably in production which means

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,020
that the less you change it the better

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,410
and their job is to focus on sustain

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,260
this sort of operability and keeping

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,790
stuff running and keeping it keeping it

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,200
going so you have this tug-of-war

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,610
because on one hand you have people

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,410
whose job it is to change things as much

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,360
as possible on the other hand you have a

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,400
group of people whose job would be very

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,880
much helped if things never changed

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,140
right once it was running so the other

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,400
thing that I think it's really important

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,200
to say whenever I talk about site

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,830
reliability engineering is sign

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,410
reliability engineering is not the next

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,150
evolutionary step from DevOps it is not

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,040
that once we're you know we were once

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,470
system ins then we're gonna grow up we

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,940
grew up and we became DevOps and now now

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,660
someday we hope to mature and become

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,520
cyber sres it is not the case in my

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,920
opinion site real a bit reliability

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,530
engineering is just another parallel

00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,080
track on opera of operations that is

00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,760
attempting to solve similar problems so

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,170
please don't take it that I think that

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,670
everybody in this room I hope someday

00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,320
you'll be oh sorry that is not what I

00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,850
hope I hope that you'll take something

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,320
from essary but I don't think you should

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,170
I don't think you should expect I grew

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,750
up and become an SRE the best way I know

00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,850
to talk about this in context is to

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,440
start with a talk that was given at a

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,690
conference that I helped start a long

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,580
time ago called SR econ which is a

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,470
conference for s eries at that

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,780
conference the very first talk given on

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,430
the very first day in the very first

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,430
time we had it and now it's been had and

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,170
in several continents around was given

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,910
by Ben trainer SPLOST

00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,800
then at that point Ben trainer he hadn't

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,230
married at that point he was the person

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
at Google in 2003 that came up with the

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,919
notion of site reliability

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,780
Engineering and in his talk he put up

00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,009
this slide you don't have to read all

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,630
these things in fact I'm not even gonna

00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:48,690
let you read all these things we're just

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:50,910
gonna focus on some of these just so you

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,160
have some context here so let's talk

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,229
about the first three things that I have

00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,210
highlighted here so the first thing is

00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:58,530
this notion that you should have an SLA

00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,880
for your service which is kind of weird

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,080
because I don't really talk about SLA is

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,320
in Google I don't know why he used that

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,120
term you measure report against that SLA

00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,800
and you use error budgets and we'll talk

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,000
about whatever budgets are later but

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,539
here's the general here's the general

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,320
idea step 1 figure out your system and

00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:18,470
what in your system you want to measure

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,639
so you understand whether it is reliable

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,410
what is your understanding about that

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,600
and we'll talk about that and that's a

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,280
site that's a service level indicator

00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,310
what is the indicator for reliability

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,560
once you have an indicator your job next

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,930
is to come up with an objective where do

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,970
I want that indicator to stay or to stay

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,710
above or below or however you measure it

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,300
once you have that you have a service

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,699
level objective and that's exactly what

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,419
we'll be talking about in this talk

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,990
congratulations you have these things

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:48,150
your next step is to put that SLO into

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,620
place into your monitoring system so

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,080
that we can all look at the monitoring

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,250
system go hey how are we doing oh we're

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,409
not doing so good oh we're doing great

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,270
it's important to have a monitoring

00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:59,580
system that everybody trusts and that is

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,080
a single source of truth so once it's in

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,820
your monitoring system then you can do

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,289
things like this let's say you have a

00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,210
new version you're trying to think about

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:07,620
whether you should release it well I can

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,479
look at my monitoring system and say

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,280
let's say let's say this thing that I'm

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,470
trying to run I'll use it I'll use an

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,150
example to make it easy let's say I want

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,349
it to be up 90% of the time it's a

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,229
terrible it's a terrible it's a little

00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:20,940
but we'll use it so 90% of the time so I

00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:23,970
look at my monitoring system and I say

00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,620
hey our thing has been up 94 95 percent

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,960
of the time it's been available 95

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,909
percent of the time well now I can say

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,740
make the decision okay maybe I'll watch

00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,870
a new version maybe it's okay to perturb

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,969
it maybe it's okay to add a little bit

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,770
of change to the system or maybe I look

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,830
at the system and I say hey wait a

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,419
second our thing has only been working

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,310
60 percent at a time what's going on

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,260
here and I might choose at that moment

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,700
to make a different decision about what

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,470
to do when it comes to that new release

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,850
I might say hey we're not going to

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,930
release anything new until we figure out

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:56,010
what's going on with this

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:58,560
so that's the basic choice okay so why

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,180
are these things important

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,010
what is the use of what we're gonna

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,140
learn today how is this helpful to you

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,300
so the first important thing to

00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,800
understand about SLI is and SLO service

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,470
level indicators and service level

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,360
objectives is they provide a common

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,610
ground in a common language so that

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,980
everybody in the company everybody in

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:20,520
the organization can speak the same

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,800
language we can all say oh I see this is

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,480
how we're measuring reliability oh I see

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,880
we haven't been that reliable oh we have

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,560
there's no arguments about this there's

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,900
no need to translate developers

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,700
understand it stakeholders understand it

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,010
all the VPS understand it you're

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,990
speaking the same language and this is

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,250
tremendously useful though those of us

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,110
who know about the Tower of Babel know

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,000
it's not always that useful

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,500
the other thing that is really good

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,780
about these things is it allows you to

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,940
focus on the data you have a

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:51,360
conversation that is based on data not

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:54,570
hey I think we were up a lot in February

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,820
or yeah you know it doesn't feel like

00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,500
things are running so good right that's

00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,610
not the sort of conversation you need to

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,260
have you need to have something that's

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,600
foot that's on objective data not

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,920
somebody's feelings about this and the

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,380
other thing that you get a chance to do

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,940
is it creates this virtuous cycle you

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,830
have the ability if everybody is paying

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,590
attention to reliability in the same way

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,750
to increase your reliability as we look

00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,610
at and say hey not so good oh it's

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,900
getting better we know exactly how much

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,980
it's getting better and we're talking

00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,280
about it in a way that helps it get

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:26,220
better there are two things that I want

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,080
to add as sort of small little asides

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,430
just so you understand so you don't

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,730
think I'm promising you something that

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,610
I'm not

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,670
step number one SLI is an Esso those are

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,250
not magic it is not the case that I can

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,350
walk into an organization have you start

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,640
doing SLI zenus those like a toxic

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,350
organization where everybody hates each

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,030
other and they're all you know they all

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,800
are carrying like a knife in their boots

00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,870
you know for when they need to use it in

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,400
the next meeting or you know I mean

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,690
we've all worked in the organization I

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,570
hope you haven't but we all worked in

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,920
situations that are toxic slic so those

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,230
will not make your environment less

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,150
toxic they might help some but they are

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,230
not magic so that's the important thing

00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,900
to understand your company will not

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,760
automatically become much more

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,199
profitable your organization might not

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,690
more people just because you do a slice

00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:11,370
Nestle OHS but it could help the other

00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,899
thing to realize is it's not entirely

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,579
clear that this is the only way to tell

00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,990
I just want to be clear about that I

00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:18,149
don't want to say I am selling you the

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,820
one true path anybody who tells you that

00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,899
they're walking the one true path well I

00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,120
think you're supposed to kill them I

00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,500
believe right is I believe the

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,089
expression when you see the book if you

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,220
see the Buddha on the path but anyway

00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:31,470
just going back to the previous awesome

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,050
talk sorry have to have to include it

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,360
okay so let's talk about slis service

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,339
level indicators so the thing to

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,019
understand about SLI is is that we're

00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,540
talking about reliability and

00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,120
reliability means a lot of different

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,649
things if you if you think about it the

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,139
first one and everybody thinks about is

00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,550
availability is my service up can I get

00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,630
to it right that's pretty obvious and

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,220
that's probably the thing that you'll be

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,570
dealing with most of the time but it's

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,680
not the only thing and I want to make

00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,839
sure that you have sort of a broad

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,010
understanding of reliability the other

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,050
possibility is you might care about

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,180
latency right there's this notion that

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:06,930
slow is the new down have you heard that

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,130
before right and so if something is too

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,990
slow you might want to make sure that

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,319
you're that you have the right level of

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,269
latency or not sometimes you care about

00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:16,709
throughput if you're running say a batch

00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,269
processing system or you're running a

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:20,190
pipeline you care a lot about throughput

00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:23,339
and you need to measure that also or

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:25,709
maybe you care about coverage how much

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,019
of the database has I processed how much

00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,339
of the data have I processed that's a

00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,529
big question

00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,000
correctness this is something that that

00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:35,220
maybe you think about maybe you don't I

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,440
hope you do but are you doing something

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,480
to measure did my systems do the right

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,860
thing when they process the data it's a

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,819
little hard to it's a little hard to

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,980
write test for that but it's not

00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:47,550
impossible it's sometimes it's screwed

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:51,240
it's crucially important quality quality

00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:53,810
is a strange a strange way a strange

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:59,310
thing let me explain what quality means

00:12:53,810 --> 00:13:00,990
there is in where I come from a video

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,569
streaming site I'm sure they exist here

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:06,269
as well right where you go to that site

00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:08,339
and it says hey here are the movies I

00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,300
recommend you watch and then it allows

00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,850
you to watch a movie

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,490
yeah something similar here please yes

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,260
okay so there's Netflix also here

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:20,510
awesome great I am actually talking

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:23,220
about Netflix wait you have computers

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,930
Sorry Sorry you can tell that I need to

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,880
spend more time in Israel just to get

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,140
the lay of the land so an Netflix way

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,120
and this is actually where the example

00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,920
comes from in Netflix if they're having

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,080
a problem with their recommendation

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,130
engine the thing that puts the on that

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,710
puts the here's what I think you should

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:39,750
watch they don't say hey sorry can't

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,070
stream can't even get to the website our

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,350
recommendation engines down we're done

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,900
right instead what they will do is they

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:48,810
will serve data in a degraded fashion

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,700
where they'll show you last you know who

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,080
you know that these are the upcoming

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,940
movies that we're about to show or the

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,710
these are the most popular movies right

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,870
and if your recommendations don't show

00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,730
up on the page they don't panic they fix

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,770
it but they give you the gate degraded

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,870
information and so quality is that

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,880
measurement of how what's the fidelity

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,710
of what I've just delivered to you have

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,540
I delivered you the entire experience or

00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:12,330
just part of an experience and you want

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:15,570
to measure that if you're dealing with a

00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:18,030
system for which freshness is important

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,040
let's say sports scores or the

00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:24,000
Eurovision contest I know you know about

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,530
that one that was a great win yes I

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,370
guess we paid too I pay attention to

00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,770
that in the u.s. I don't know but

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,420
everybody else but anyway so you might

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,460
care a lot about freshness and then

00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,130
finally if you're in charge of a storage

00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:37,020
system or a database system you kind of

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,370
want to measure if I put a bit in I'm

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,290
gonna get that bit out again later

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,910
right that's important and you need to

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,280
be able to have objectives and

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:46,770
indicators around that now let me say

00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,540
the most important thing let people love

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,650
to take a picture of this slide but if

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,140
you're gonna take a picture of a slide

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:54,660
take a picture of this one which has

00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,610
that on it what I want you to understand

00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,030
is everything that we're talking about

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:03,060
here is from the perspective of the

00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:06,720
customer or the user be that internal

00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,530
via external it does you no good to sit

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,690
here I'll get out of the way some people

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:15,290
would you know anyone use selfie with us

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:18,110
it does you no good to measure how hot

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:21,230
your CPU is running who cares I don't

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,670
really care the question is from the

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,410
customer's perspective

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,269
am i achieving that reliability because

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,529
we're doing it for a reason right we're

00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:29,750
not running machines because we like to

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,730
walk over and pet them or or pay money

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,769
to Azure or something like that we do it

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,860
because we're trying to serve something

00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:38,300
and serve somebody okay and so all of

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,279
this has to be measured from that

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,870
perspective if you take one thing away

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,329
from this this is a good thing to take

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,860
away if you want to take a second thing

00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:47,480
I'm happy to do a picture you know like

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,790
a you know a commemorative picture and

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,829
sign your picture later if you want so

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,390
so here's how a soul eyes are computed

00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:55,490
just so you understand so this is pretty

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,740
easy so you might decide to come up with

00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,850
SL eyes and they're basically ratios so

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,329
an example would be the number of

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:05,810
successful HTTP calls over the number of

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:07,130
total calls yes make sense or maybe the

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,010
number of operations are completed in

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,690
less than 10 milliseconds or the number

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,180
of full quality responses that we were

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,790
talking before or the number of Records

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:20,270
processed over the number of Records

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,529
total right it's a ratio so you can

00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,990
probably guess that right it's not that

00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:26,200
hard so let's do this this this terrible

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,959
math if we were to take the ratio

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,370
multiply it by 100 we get a percentage

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,839
proportion and and we're gonna test your

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,730
math skills in just a second just so you

00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,500
understand but here's a key thing that I

00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,800
want to say about this it is really

00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:43,339
crucial to say how and where you're

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,529
measuring this in your slis okay so for

00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,839
example I might say the nut that for

00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:50,300
that ratio as measured at my load

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,040
balancer does that make sense to you

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,079
that I have to tell you where I am

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,790
getting in from for us to have a really

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,230
useful conversation because you may

00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,850
think it's the load balancer and I may

00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,589
think it's the server and we are talking

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,870
two completely different things because

00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:05,240
let's say you have a situation where all

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,280
your packets don't get to your server if

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,870
I measure all if I if I go to the server

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,790
and ask it like how you know what how

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,929
many successful calls I may not know

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,419
about the ones that fail because I never

00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:16,550
saw the data right so it's crucial to

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:17,540
say that or you measure it to client if

00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,179
you're doing if you're doing some sort

00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,550
of some sort of latency thing or in your

00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,660
server log or determined by the app or

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,290
something something like that just so

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,570
you understand

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,460
it's kind of crucial okay let's do the

00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:31,760
let's do the terrible math this is how

00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,990
hard simple slis are are you ready can

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,450
we can we work really hard on this ready

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:38,420
I'm gonna show you some complex math

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:42,590
let's say we have 50 successful HTTP

00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:47,930
calls out of 100 HTTP calls are you

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:50,810
ready the ratio is 0.5 got it this is

00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:54,500
how hard we're gonna get I'm pretty sure

00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:55,760
are you sure okay so if we were to do

00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,320
this multiplication

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,060
everybody here ready for this stuff you

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,540
have your calculator out somebody care

00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,760
to tell me how reliable that is yes

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,250
there we go 50 percent availability

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,600
that's it that's how hard that is now

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,590
where do these numbers come from like

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,670
when you're when you're just picking it

00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,930
when you're trying to decide like where

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,460
do I go get these numbers to measure

00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,380
well

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,180
maybe you go look at it at the server

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,320
maybe it's on the server itself tells

00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,720
you or there's some sort of log

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,490
collector that pulls it up maybe I ask

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,140
that have some sort of client library

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,750
that reports back to a telemetry system

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,920
maybe it's reported by my application

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,630
itself

00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,120
maybe the front-end the load balancer

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,620
tells me these things or maybe I get it

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,210
from the monitoring or at some you know

00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,770
we are running some sort of monitoring

00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,120
or test infrastructure infrastructure I

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,410
hope I hope you're running them on our

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,310
infrastructure otherwise we'll have a

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:45,290
second estimate SR we talk after this

00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,760
here's the thing it's your call I'm not

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,530
going to tell you where you have to do

00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,450
this measurement it's up to you but just

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,250
understand those trade-offs I understand

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,880
that situation where if I measure it

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,620
over here I may not see all the packets

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,720
right if I measure if I measure it at

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,590
the server I may not see all the fail

00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,580
failures and that might be crucial oh

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,200
and the other thing that's down here I'm

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,240
sorry the tiny thing the bottom says you

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,970
have to be able to trust your monitoring

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,180
system for this to work if somebody can

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,500
walk over and say you know I'm looking

00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,630
at the smarting system and it's lacking

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,940
the data from Tuesday I think your

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:22,370
modern where the system isn't is isn't

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,440
isn't worth trek right like if you left

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,450
starting up sorry I don't know if I'm

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,130
allowed to say it on the stage but it's

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,300
not worth anything if somebody can say

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,380
to you I don't trust your monitoring

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,170
system and this all goes out the window

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,960
okay so that's a crucial requirement to

00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,850
do these things okay great so now let's

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,590
do service level objectives

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,330
the way it helps me to understand

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,340
service level objectives is to emphasize

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,770
the last word so I would like to know

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:50,660
here in your best American accent you

00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:51,590
say the word objectives that was that

00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,940
was pretty good it was almost like

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,220
you've already doing it so I want to

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,660
appreciate how well you did that you had

00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,040
the nice nasal quality if you like I'll

00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,880
show you my American Hebrew it has a lot

00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,780
of cats in it

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,360
yeah if you like so service love

00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,490
objectives our objectives what do I want

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,530
to make sure that is true what is my

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,000
objective so let's say I'm making an

00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,910
Esso let's let's pretend I'm making an

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,770
SLO cake let's give you the recipe the

00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,020
first step is what is it that I'm

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,340
measuring in this particular case it

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,140
could be HTTP requests it could be

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,520
storage checks it could be operations in

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,400
this peculiar case I'm gonna measure

00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,970
HTTP requests as reported by the load

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,280
balancer that have succeeded yes

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,630
got that yes okay so that's the first

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,600
thing what is it we're measuring and

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:38,990
then the question is what is the

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,910
proportion well I'm gonna say 90% again

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,250
terrible you know if your top nine 90%

00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:46,060
might be actually fine successful 50% of

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,650
time can read the data 99.9% of the time

00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,230
returns at 10 milliseconds 90% of time

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,460
there we go 90% of a ship request is

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,320
reported by the load balancer have

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,780
succeeded and the last thing that you

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,780
need for a successful SLO is some sort

00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:02,030
of time boundary in the last 10 minute

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,980
period during the last quarter in the

00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,080
previous rolling 30-day period and in

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,450
fact s ellos are often done in rolling

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,460
30 day things or rolling seven day

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:13,370
things as opposed to this month because

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,900
month days change but sometimes you want

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,130
them per month especially for financial

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,290
stuff okay

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:23,720
so congratulations your first SLO

00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:25,400
applause please and the reason why

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,250
that's so weak is you're like is it

00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,100
really this easy and the answer is yes

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,450
it can be really this easy so that's why

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,500
you don't have to you know I'm not gonna

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,750
show you something that your walk are

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,480
you going that's I could never do that

00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,010
that's alchemy okay so if you want to

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,510
make it more complex you can in fact

00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,950
you'll eventually find yourself doing

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,800
that you'll start doing things like

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,510
compound ones will you say okay 90% of

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,210
the reads take place in 10 in 10

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,710
milliseconds but 95% did

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,330
in less than 20 milliseconds you start

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,890
doing these compound statements where

00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,470
you're trying to model the system in a

00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:00,290
better way right not just a simple thing

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,510
or you might say you might do things by

00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,250
percentiles not you know 95th percentile

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,360
that sort of stuff that that can come

00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,320
later there's no reason why you have to

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,760
start there but that will eventually

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,950
show up that will eventually show up

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,170
when you do this stuff ok so where do we

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,610
get these s lows where where am I going

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,960
to get these numbers from how am I going

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,930
to determine what the right numbers are

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,210
the first possibility is that maybe I

00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,010
already know that there's this customer

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,450
expectation that my latency has to be

00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,520
this slow because I have some monitoring

00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,860
that says I start losing business at a

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,990
if it gets any slower than that or maybe

00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,970
somebody comes to me and says hey I want

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,690
to use your service and I expect from

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:37,160
you a response within 10 milliseconds

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,390
right sometimes some customers will just

00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,160
tell you and you'll just know what they

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,990
are and that's great and you can use

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:46,760
them in that's fabulous

00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:48,770
sometimes there's some other data where

00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,620
somebody out there somewhere says I

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,990
think the number here should be 90% and

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,890
you're like cool right and you don't

00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,240
know where they get it from or maybe

00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,470
they don't even know where they go from

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,940
but sometimes somebody will just hand

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,000
you a number and you could use that

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,790
number if you wanted to it is possible

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,650
to use the current state of the system

00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:09,650
you can say hey we've been running at

00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:12,140
90% for the last three months let's use

00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,610
90 percent the thing that I want to tell

00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,380
you and I want to warn you about doing

00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,150
that it's certainly possible in the

00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,970
absence of any other data it's not bad

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:22,100
but if you do do that then sometimes you

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:25,520
will box yourself in unnecessarily let's

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,200
say that you've been running at 95% and

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,840
so you say oh I think 95 percent is a

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,360
good SLO and then you realize that you

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,390
had a not had at just a really good week

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,430
but it's not usually like that or maybe

00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,920
the people that are expecting data from

00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:42,320
you don't need it at 95% and you could

00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,900
have more room and slack if you wanted

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,060
to so just a warning along those lines

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,100
okay so why don't we do with this stuff

00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,990
in there sorry there's also the concept

00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,460
of something called an error budget and

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,550
so let's talk a little about error

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,410
budgets okay so here's our budgets let's

00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,510
assume that we've done that previous

00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,730
exercise and we've come up with three

00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,930
different SL O's one that says hey the

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,890
system should be only 60 percent

00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,360
available or

00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,580
whatever you want to say this one over

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,930
here should have be 70% and this one

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:15,890
should be 90% the error budget is simply

00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:18,500
this extra stuff at the end does that

00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:21,530
make sense it's this extra slack we have

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:24,560
it's this extra thing at the end after

00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,990
which I don't care if the system is down

00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,600
because I have already met my objective

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,790
it's this pool of unreliability that I

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,190
can draw upon does that make sense if I

00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:36,140
say it's okay to be up 60% of time and I

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,510
have been up 62 percent of the time the

00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,370
rest is the American idiom would be

00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:43,490
gravy but I don't know what you'd say in

00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:45,050
Hebrew say again you don't have to

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,710
translate the word gravy for me because

00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,050
I bet it's not that

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:52,580
oh yeah the rest discipline is probably

00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:55,640
not so much so here's the thing this

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:58,010
plus having some sort of plan or policy

00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,140
of what to do with this extra stuff

00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:04,190
makes up an error budget so what do you

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,720
do well what do you do so the questions

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,610
I want to ask is what do you do if you

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,410
exceed your error budgets and what do

00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,170
you do if you exhaust your error budgets

00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:14,510
and I'm gonna give you the only one true

00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,580
answer that anybody can ever give you

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,560
and I'm gonna be absolutely honest with

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,790
you because anybody who tells you

00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,780
anything different than what I'm about

00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:26,810
to tell you is lying or at least missa

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:30,220
missa misinformed the only answer to

00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:34,010
these two questions are it depends I

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:37,700
want to be very clear about that it

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,470
really does depend on how you want to do

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,060
things in your environment and what

00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,500
makes sense for you but let me give you

00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,570
a couple of options so let's say you

00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,060
exceed your error budget right well

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:50,030
you've successfully been up for more

00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:52,760
than you expected yay you did it

00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:54,470
congratulations celebrates break out the

00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,160
break out the you know the wholeness I

00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:02,050
guess is right you just pour it into

00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,460
like a champagne cup anyway yes right so

00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:06,620
no but it's good right it's it's I mean

00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,300
this is a good place to be so so what do

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,890
we do about this well maybe when we

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,330
might choose to do is release faster we

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,920
might increase the release cadence that

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,390
seems perfectly reasonable that's a

00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,710
perfectly reasonable thing to do or

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,920
maybe we will increase the number of

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,170
features that we're going to clue

00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,300
when the product sounds great can do

00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,800
that because we can now be a little less

00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:27,240
reliable we have a little more room to

00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,830
play we can experiment a little bit more

00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,350
we can have more experimental features

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,730
we can rewrite things and put experiment

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,850
those things in because now we know that

00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:38,040
if we perturb the reliability it's okay

00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:40,110
and we can just simply increase the

00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,640
change in our environment if our if our

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,890
error budget if we you know exceeded our

00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,820
budgets or here's the thing you can also

00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:50,010
do nothing you could simply do nothing

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,650
you could celebrate your thing and do

00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,180
nothing different it's a possibility I

00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:58,010
just want you to understand that nothing

00:26:54,180 --> 00:27:00,360
compels you to go do anything right so

00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,700
or if someone suggests you could also go

00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,750
change your SLO and make them more more

00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,220
something if you wanted to but I don't

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,300
think that's necessary this is it

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,580
necessarily you might be the right thing

00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,650
to do now let's say you've exhausted

00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,380
your era budget let's say for some

00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,030
reason that slack has gone down and you

00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,480
are less reliable than you would hoped

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:20,640
for uh-oh now we might want to do

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,500
something about it right so we might do

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,840
things like we might release a little

00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,550
slower because now we have to spend a

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,040
little bit of time instrumenting our

00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:31,110
system to find out what happened how did

00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,830
this go wrong what went wrong with this

00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:36,660
we might want to focus our resources on

00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:38,940
reliability instrumentation going back

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,590
and looking at how did this fail in

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,000
production we might want to spend the

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,200
time on that and it's probably a good

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,440
use of your time you might divert

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,300
engineering resources to look at that

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,490
you might if you have to push the big

00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,710
red button the thing that says everybody

00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:55,230
stop the entire company the entire

00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,210
organization stop we have not been

00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,640
reliable enough we are so far down that

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,960
this is a crisis and we need to pay

00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,450
attention to with all our resources

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,250
sometimes that happens and it happens in

00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,840
lots of companies that happens in Google

00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,970
you know where they will push the big

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,260
red button and say sorry no more

00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,580
releases no more anything until we

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:15,150
figure out what the heck is happening

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:17,250
with our SOS or you might say hey maybe

00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,900
the to go to your point you might maybe

00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,300
our SLI Sonesta those aren't correct

00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,070
maybe they are too strict and maybe I

00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,840
need to loose them that's okay it's

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,430
perfectly reasonable and then again

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,450
here's the last thing you could possibly

00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,320
do

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:32,210
[Laughter]

00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,500
it says nothing you could choose to do

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,750
nothing with this you could choose to

00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,040
say this is information take it for

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,020
someone who's been in couples counseling

00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,030
before one of the things that you learn

00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,560
when you speak to your spouse's that's

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,390
information what you're telling me I

00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,570
don't necessarily have to do something

00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:49,220
about it but now I understand it right

00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,420
we can have a long conversation without

00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,070
this afterwards if you're like we'll

00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:55,880
have a whole open space about couples

00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:58,610
counseling if you want so okay so great

00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,140
here's the key thing no matter what you

00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:04,150
do when you when any of these things

00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:08,090
happen make a plan and follow your plan

00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:10,850
don't be sitting around on Thursday or

00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:12,500
Friday and go hey we have you know we

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,000
have exhaust our error budget what do

00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,110
you think we should do I don't know what

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,190
do you think we should do I don't know

00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,110
what do you think we should you know you

00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,610
don't want to be doing that right you

00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,260
want to have a plan in place and you

00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,060
want to follow that plan feel free to

00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,980
adjust it later but that's the key thing

00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:27,710
to understand is when this happens make

00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,510
a plan and file the plan so my question

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:32,150
is before I talk a little bit about how

00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:34,220
to get further into s into s re would

00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,930
you like to ask questions now or would

00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,360
you like to know how I suggest you get

00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,950
deeper into the land of essary are there

00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,880
questions otherwise we'll save the

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,680
questions too and then we can have a

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,480
little question time and a little bit of

00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,200
discussion about my marriage whatever

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,960
you like if you want only only one

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,320
marriage 27 years yeah

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,000
so it's true we're great I'm gonna go

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,190
home and say you know honey I had a

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,730
great talk and they applauded for our

00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:04,760
marriage and she's gonna be like why are

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,990
you saying this on stage but actually

00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:11,540
she probably won't because it's been

00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:16,160
like I said 27 years watch what's your

00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:20,510
secret do nothing yet I would like to

00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:25,940
suggest humbly that it is just like

00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:27,050
DevOps is work so so is that really what

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,910
we're gonna talk about during question

00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,410
the answer is that really because

00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,440
because that's not exactly where I was

00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,730
prepared to go but I can do it

00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,620
how many kids so great this is lovely

00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:40,820
this is how you know you're in Israel

00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,570
right I have one his name is Elijah he

00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,610
is 12

00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,430
he has his Bar Mitzvah coming up it's

00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,840
gonna be wonderful I hope so yeah I know

00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,430
so now we're all feeling it's great I

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,840
love it anyway you have a if you have a

00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:56,210
question is not about me and my family

00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:57,320
please I just ask pretty please yeah so

00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,150
the question of the question is when you

00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,800
say make a plan file plan I am saying

00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,540
that is part of your construction of

00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,370
your error budget you need to have a

00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,710
conversation with the stakeholders that

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,480
say okay let's assume we're doing really

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,580
great what do we do about it

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,070
let's assume that we are doing poorly

00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:15,080
what are we gonna do and you might have

00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,280
as part of that as part of that actual

00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,690
thing that you write down when you write

00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,160
down all these things cuz you better be

00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:21,290
writing this stuff down you don't want

00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,200
to be thinking like what did we say 60%

00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:26,030
no no no I'm pretty sure I heard 65% in

00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,380
that meeting you know in that thing you

00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,900
want to have a plan that you have

00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,370
written down and everyone agrees to you

00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,930
know and if you look at the plan six

00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,300
months later and it's stupid and it's

00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,010
like you know you know if I if our SLO

00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,950
falls behind 70% we should run around

00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:43,790
going help me help me you know like

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:45,350
that's your plan then maybe you want to

00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:49,370
change that I think that's perfectly

00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:52,310
reasonable yes sir so the question is

00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:53,630
how do you know when an SLO how do you

00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,000
know when you've got the right SLO

00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:58,690
essentially and the short answer is

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,250
that's usually as part of a conversation

00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:05,780
usually you have this conversation you

00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:08,930
walk up to a developer like this and you

00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:11,780
say so tell me you have this great

00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:13,610
application how much do you think it

00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,890
needs to be up how is it going to fail

00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:17,900
what is important to you or maybe you

00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,700
come over here to this business this

00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,280
person here who runs the company and you

00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,660
say to this person how you know what is

00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,060
important to you how much money should

00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,680
we spend so it's one of these it's one

00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,860
of these conversations where it depends

00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,480
where your job is to attempt to get an

00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,250
understanding that is communally from

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,660
the stakeholders of what is the right

00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,340
thing how can you tell when we're

00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,330
running because for example you might

00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,220
look at the dependents

00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,320
seize on that service and say they're

00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,179
all expecting you to be up 70% of the

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,580
time so that would be one way you could

00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:48,649
find find what matters to you you could

00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,000
look at drop-offs on punt sales there's

00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:51,409
lots of ways to determine what's there

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,649
and you will always be tweaking these

00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:55,940
things up and down if that makes sense

00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:57,590
other questions I like coming out here

00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,830
in the audience you guys are your you're

00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:04,519
a beautiful audience

00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:05,840
any other questions yes sir so the

00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,700
question is how do you deal with client

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,019
diversity so what I like about what

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,370
you're saying is that you're looking at

00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:11,450
or immediately you're starting to think

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,220
clients and you're starting to think

00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,440
customers so good for you for thinking

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,149
that way so the answer the question is

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,309
I'm gonna get a shirt by the way that

00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:20,720
just says it depends or I'm gonna work

00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:22,610
on stage with like a set of adult

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,470
diapers that just say depends and just

00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:27,649
wave it in the ear if I have to but the

00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:29,570
short answer is it depends you might

00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:32,120
choose to make an SLO there's a compound

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:36,799
one that says hey I want to make sure my

00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:39,019
95 print 25% I love this is this my 64

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,519
my 50th percentile is this and etc so

00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:43,639
you might choose to make a more complex

00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:47,149
SLO to better model what's important to

00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:48,649
you so the question is how many so the

00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:50,269
question is how many SLI in SLO do you

00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:53,889
have per application and system and

00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:56,269
service want to guess what my answer is

00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:57,950
anybody here anybody here like if I can

00:33:56,269 --> 00:34:00,049
if I if I can get the entire audience to

00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:03,289
say it depends - does that help because

00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:03,740
I can do that here let's try that there

00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:06,169
you go

00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,490
so the answer the answer is you have to

00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:10,159
sort of play with it to see what makes

00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:11,899
sense to you too many and too complex

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,669
this thing where you can't monitor it

00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:15,020
and you can't take it can't understand

00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:16,580
it and you can't understand what the

00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,919
system you're trying to model is does

00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:22,250
not work I simple the thing that says

00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:23,599
you know yes/no also does not work right

00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,950
so you have to find the balance that

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,780
works for you on that system and it

00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:29,510
depends on the system itself and the

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,899
complexity of that system I'll take one

00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,369
more

00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:33,320
actually let's go let's let's do this

00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,609
part here let's talk about how if you

00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,500
decide you want to get into sre

00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:37,790
including the people that just walked in

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,139
pleasure to see you you missed an

00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:42,679
awesome talk these people in the room

00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:44,510
will tell you so if you want to get into

00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,889
sre here's the way i recommend because

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,629
people usually ask me how do i get

00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:49,040
started the first thing I'd say is that

00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,010
there are three lovely books from

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,720
O'Reilly and just as a disclaimer I ho

00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:56,720
to edit one of them the one on the end

00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:59,240
the lemur book is mine and there are

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,000
really good one of how does Google how

00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,380
did Google do SRA how do they think that

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,360
other people can do it in some other

00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,920
examples and some more how to do that

00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,870
sort of stuff this is what they did is

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,490
it kind of how did do it in mind a sort

00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,440
of way that a - book that tries to

00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,340
expand the question you know what's it

00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,050
mean to do essary

00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,940
one of the important things that you

00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,250
have to know about how do companies that

00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,600
are not Google in Amazon do things how

00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,280
do companies that do think that look

00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,890
closer to what you're used to do things

00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,720
and that's where that comes from I think

00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,940
it's a lovely book if you want to wait

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,020
for the movie I think that's perfectly

00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:36,320
reasonable sign the copies if you got a

00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,000
copy I'll sign it but that's the best I

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,620
can I don't know how available it is

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,920
here I know you can get this online

00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:44,990
electronically easily so the other thing

00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,070
is again this is an again disclaimer

00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,570
because I had something to do with this

00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,520
as well there's a lovely set of

00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,690
conferences that is taking their plates

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,910
place on three continents

00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,340
called SEO recon the next one is going

00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:58,790
to be in Brooklyn New York which i think

00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,920
is a pretty cool place so come visit if

00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,210
you can you know make sure if you come

00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,370
you tell me so we could we can all get

00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,750
together and talk about that time where

00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,330
we were in the room together and I can't

00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,280
talk about this and the other thing that

00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:13,460
I want to say is how do you personally

00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:16,130
start for fun down here there's a link

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,260
to an online course that I wrote for

00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,310
Microsoft which is free you can you can

00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,620
go get that I'll get out of the way for

00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:23,090
that the other thing is my experience is

00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,520
people typically start because they have

00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:27,320
a problem or they have some downtime or

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,730
they have an epiphany they wake up in

00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,480
the middle of the night and they go hey

00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,500
wait a second I should do a sorry but it

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,500
doesn't usually happen that way usually

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,520
what happens is they have a bad downtime

00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,140
the other thing you'll need to do is get

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,870
management support lined up and we can

00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,040
talk about what that means I recommend

00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,330
when you read those books and this is my

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,370
last line in case in the case you're

00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:48,110
concerned one of the things that that

00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,240
you should do is read the book

00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,590
critically don't look at them like like

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,510
you know there's some sort of like the

00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,580
like they're so dari right don't be

00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,930
reading them to each other right as if

00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,330
this is the thing you have that you have

00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:00,890
to follow right look at them and figure

00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,020
out which makes sense for you in the
